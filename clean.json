The Space Impact game which I crossed every level. The bright yellow display. The alphanumeric keypad. The struggle to type 's\u2019. The Nokia Ringtone! The dark area where you could get your SIM card blocked. It was a fun device altogether, sometimes better than today's devices. Love ^ What should I do on my brand new Mac first? What is the name of the first mobile bought? How long should I charge a new phone before the first use? Which brand of mobile phone do 'real' techies use and why? Is Asus a reliable brand for phones (Zenfone)? The first phone i ever owned was Sony Ericsson w580i . That was way back in 2008. It got stolen with a year and then followed a slew of phones Sony Ericsson w580i Sony Ericsson f305 LG Cookie Spice Mi 300 (My First Smartphone) Lg Optimus One Sony Xperia S LG G2 (Current phone) LG G2 has been my best and most used phone (been using it for almost 3 years) till now. Now looking for a capable replacement. I am eyeing Oneplus 5. If it does not turn out good, I will go for Galaxy S7 Edge. Samsung Folding phone - 2006 Samsung Sliding phone - 2007 Samsung Metal phone - 2008 Nokia 5310 - 2009 Samsung Smart phone i5510 - 2009 Samsung guru 3310 - 2010 Samsung Ace Smartphone - 2012 Samsung Grand 2 - 2014 Samsung Galaxy S6 - 2015 Samsung On Nxt - 2016 Samsung Galaxy S8 - 2017 I still Remember the time when I first bought a new Mobile phone. I was doing my B-Tech those days and was living in a Hostel. I couldn't cope up staying away from home in a different city and not being able to talk to parents. So I requested my parents to get me a phone. To my surprise they agreed (Probably they were missing me equally or maybe even more). But college life is more often about show-off. I wanted a phone with camera feature not just any other simple call-messaging phone. I started saving money. I used to get 2k per month and with quality saving for 4 months I bought a Nokia E63 plus the money given by my parents. I was in the Top of the world and used to flaunt it every where. Holidays came and I went home. No one had any doubt on the price nor did I disclose. But Alas while returning from home I lost my phone. I lost it to pickpocketing. It felt as if I had lost everything, I had just used it for a month. Next I saved again, and bought a simple cell-phone with just calling feature. Had to lie to my parents that the previous phone was my friend's and we had exchanged it for two weeks! Had hard time convincing that.",

        "a": "Do you mean as a person? If so I believe you're trolling, but if you mean as a leader of a nation regarding his success in almost taking over the world, Hitler was so good at what he did because he was passionate about everything he did in the political realm. His love for Germany is undeniable and there is no doubt in my mind that Hitler was doing what he did because he thought it would make Germany better. Hitler had no ill will against Germany the nation as a whole. He was also very charismatic, and could incite a crowd like almost no other politician in history. All that being said Hitler is a demented and evil man, however, it would be unwise for us as a society to not study Hitler and nazi Germany in depth, and truly understand the full situation in nazi Germany and Hitler's mind during the time leading up to and during the Second World War. It is our duty to be knowledgeable about Hitler and the events leading up to the Second World War so that we can ensure that nothing like that ever happens again. Was there any good in Hitler? Hitler and the Nazi party seemed to have good values and were good to their people. How did it turn out so badly? Why? Where is Hitler's body? Where did he die? Was there a good side to Hitler? Why did Germany lose WWII? Good? Are you kidding? He\u2019s been one of the worst creatures that ever lived on this planet. He killed millions of people, he destroyed cities, he robbed works of art, he discriminated entire communities, he occupied entire countries basing everything onto his own idea of \u201cBig Germany\u201d. If there\u2019s a word that could describe his personality, it certainly isn\u2019t \u201cgood\u201d. Let\u2019s approach this in the context of rephrasing the question to, \u2018Why was Hitler so successful in rising from a failed poster artist to one step short of world domination?\u2019 What Hitler had was a gift of speech, an ability to sway a crowd using only words and gestures. His experiences with the German Army in the trenches of World War I, his injury from a gas attack, his recovery and sense of shame when Germany sued for peace and struggled under the penalties of the Versailles Treaty figure prominently in his book \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019. He looked into several clubs that leaned heavily into solving the \u2018problems\u2019 of Germany, finally finding a place with the National Socialist Party\u2026the Nazis. He rose quickly through the ranks, only to stumble in a failed coup\u2026the Beer Hall Pusch of 1923, which landed him in Landsberg Prison for a little over a year. Once he was out, he found himself more popular than ever. Through speaking engagements and some subterfuge on the side, he was soon at the top echelon of the Nazi Party. By January, 1933, he was Chancellor of Germany. By March, he was the sole leader. By July, the Nazis were the only political party left in Germany and Hitler was \u2018F\u00fchrer\u2019 to his countrymen. Hitler became the voice of a nation wracked by depression, starvation, internal strife and inaction. He challenged the victorious Entente in reclaiming German dominance in the industrial Ruhr valley, rearmed the military and built warships against the terms of Versailles and brought wealth and pride back to a defeated nation. Of course, all this came at a price. To further his needs, Hitler had to find scapegoats to bear the burden of the previous failures of Germany. After cleaning out potential rival parties in staging the Reichstag fire and eliminating Nazi rivals in \u2018The Night of Long Knives\u2019, Hitler\u2019s (and hence Germany\u2019s) finger, came down upon the Jewish population. This, as you put it, is where \u2018good\u2019 ends. The rest is a long and bloody history. Hitler was not a good person. Hitler orchestrated a mass murder of 12 million \u2018untermensch\u2019 because he was angry about WWI. He started a war that killed 65 million people for no real reason. Hitler was not a good person. Hitler was an evil scumbag. I hate these troll question with a passion. I wouldn't say Hitler was particularly \u201cgood\u201d. I will say he was good too the German-Austrian people. You are probably looking for the word \u201ccharismatic\u201d. Adolf Hitler was a very charismatic leader. He could influence you too get on his side from just having a conversation. Off topic: I fell sorry for Modern day German volk. They can't say to much on WW2 without being called names. I find it very unfair. Winston Churchill was just as evil. History taught in school is not very reliable in information. If I was you, I would go buy books and study it yourself. People who deny the holocaust are just seriously plain out stupid. Millions upon millions of parent & grandparents came out after the war. Anyone with a brain knows that the holacaust did happen. So yeah, sorry for getting off topic. Hope I helped.",

        "a": "No offense, but it\u2019s neither one. Actually none of the countries in South-Asia can represent any of these aspects. Through the Islamic history, if you inspect closely, every prophets and messenger represents the pillars. They made Islam stand on what it is today, not the region where they spread their words. And if you consider the backbone of Islam, all the faith of Muslims are held on the Ka\u2019aba of Mecca. All the Muslims have their faith stood tall around it. (May Allah forbid) If it falls, so would the faith of billions of Muslims. And if your question is based on the size of Muslim population based on a country or region, even there Pakistan fails to qualify as both pillar or backbone since Indonesia is at the top on Muslim majority population. Also, don\u2019t forget that Islam wasn\u2019t spread in the Indian sub-continent in a large scale until the Mughals invaded. What do the five pillars of Islam do for Allah? Is it a crime to be an atheist in Islamic countries like Pakistan? Will Pakistan be able to payback the loan of CPEC? What are the Five Pillar of the Islam? Is the Constitution of Pakistan Islamic? Why do they need a constitution? Why does the TTP attack Pakistan? Pakistan is not regarded as a pillar or backbone of Islam, but fortress of Islam as it is the first Islamic state in the world which is established in the name of Islam after the state of Medina. If you exclude Islam from Pakistan, there is no reason for it to be a separate country. We Pakistanis whether from any region or ethnic denomination, love Islam from the core of our hearts despite most of us are not practicing Muslims. Islam is the binding force in Pakistan and there is no compromise on it. As a nation, we may have differences of opinion, political polarization and sense of deprivation for one reason or the other, but when it comes to Islam we are one. Those who are the champions of human rights and champions of freedom of religion want every right for them, but there is no room in their hearts for the individuals who want to follow Islam. Thai proverb \u201c If you want to know Buddha, go to Pakistan. Iran, Kashmir, Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan was the heartland of Buddhism for thousands of Years.

        "a": "Depends of what type of person you are and of what you want. Mathematics is perfection, is fiction, is pure logic. You can have two points of view on mathematics: It is a world that  you build  by creating your functions, setting your rules, seing what happens then. Or it is a world that starts to exists once you have settled the undemonstrable basic rules and that  you discover. Physics is also pretty much perfect in its theories but is way more applicative. You observe and measure. From that you build models that have the goal to fit the most yours observations. And then, you do your best to  prove yourself wrong.  If you fail to prove yourself wrong, then maybe your theory/model is close to reality. Often researchers discover/measure new things that will disprove models and in these cases new models are created to fit the \u201cmeasured\u201d reality. And the \u201cultimate goal\u201d is to find a model that answers everything (energetic, matter, laws of physics, aso..) I would say that both are really enjoyable and astounding. In my case, I really prefer mathematics because I am the dreaming/geeky/living in fiction type of person and because I sense too much bounderies in our universe possibilities. So, short answer: both are nice, and the better is subjective and really depends on you. (It is only my opinion, I am no expert on the subject; also, sorry for bad english, french being my mothertongue.) Are Physics majors better at mathematics than Math majors? What is the role of mathematics in physics? How can we use mathematics and physics to live better? Why do we need mathematics to explain physics? I have two options front of me. One is doing an honors physics major amd the other one is a physics major with mathematics minor. Which one is... I majored in physics because I hated math. Not that physics isn't all math. But physics makes math make sense. Frankly, I found that the way math is taught by mathematicians overemphasizes A Right Way To Do Math that made math taught by many mathematicians distinctly unenjoyable. In one math course in particular, a professor launched into a minute-long tirade when asked the simple question by a student, \u201cHow is this applied?\u201d The answer from another student that the concepts being studied were used in combinatorial chemistry and quantum mechanics brought that professor's enmity for the rest of that student's attendance at the university. Let me ask a counter question . Who is better father , mother , sister , brother We cannot answer right? Because all four are equally important. Physics , Mathematics , Chemistry all are important , interconnected. It is our perception that makes them different and better over one other. All are study of nature in their pure form. It depends on your interest which makes one better than other. If a physicist is brilliant in maths, it would be useful for him as he can use the maths into the derivations effortlessly. and he'd be a better phyisicist! However knowing too much physics won\u2019t help a mathematician in any way. It would be preposterous for a mathematician, as he won't be able to use it in any sort of way! And without mathematical proofs, physics would be nothing more than some collection of facts! This interpretation puts the mathematician onto the higher position. However I've developed greater fondness towards physics recently. So I'm really not in the position to answer this question! :P",

I have heard scholarly presentations with humor in them; however, I have not seen it used in scholarly papers\u2014with the exception of papers on humor itself and on topics in which humor was integral, such as studies on the works of Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) and Will Rogers (an American political humorist). It may have been used successfully else where, but I have not seen it in my experiences. Humor is extremely hazardous and unpredictable. I am referring here to using a \u201cwebsite with Chuck Norris jokes.\u201d If the Chuck Norris fact is pertinent and effective, then it would be wise to get it from a source that has a reputation for gathering and disseminating reliable information\u2014a scholarly must. With many scholars, irony does not work well. So, the success of making a \u201cslightly ironic\u201d reference will depend heavily on attracting the attention of the right audience. As an international martial arts champion and a successful actor in movies and television, Chuck Norris has areas of expertise that can be accepted by scholarly communities. The key to having success will be using the right expertise for the topic of your scholarly paper. If the slightly ironic reference does not use his expertise, but, perhaps, uses him as an example of using celebrity opinions where they should not be used, then the success of the reference will depend on how widely Chuck Norris is known to your audience. Mr. Norris is well known worldwide, so there should not be too much of a risk in this regard. Before I bought a source in order to get and use a specific reference in something I was writing, I would have to be totally convinced that the reference was crucial to the paper\u2014that without it I could not make my point at all. If I am not convinced of this, then the only reason I would purchase the source is if I would like to add it to my library for its own value or I would just like to read it. Hope this helps.",

        "a": "Many have answered this question before me with the technical aspects of the subject. It should be clear by now how just is the process. Allah dislikes divorce. But, still gave the option and freedom to avail it. Let me address the other aspect of your question. Does Allah really care about women ? This small video will let you know how much he cares. Hope this helps.. Islam: My Muslim husband doesn't let me eat pork, but I really want to. What should I do? How do I learn more about Islam as a Muslim? What is Richard Muller's view on Islam? Is it wrong on part of Muslim women to marry a Hindu men? Does Islam really forbids Muslim women to marry men from other religion (Hindu)? Is Islam a religion of peace? Hello my dear brother or sister, Divorce, my friend is not something that is part of Islam yet can be done if you are a Muslim. People usually look for the appearance\u00a0 , Money etc. But they never look at the Heart , is it pure of the good and kind ,they also never look at the BEHAVIOUR ,the person that you like might not be a good person to their parents ,or their religion which is something truly wrong. Allah wrote in the Holy Quran ,surah's about the greatness of women like: Sorat al Nisaa(Nisaa=Women) talks about the greatness of a woman\u2019s heart, kindness, pure hearted)In fact when I read the Holy Quran there is no surah for Men ,only about\u00a0 the prophets. Sorat Mariam talks about her mom who wanted to bring a son, but Allah gave her a girl called Mariam .She influenced how strong a woman can be even by many peoples insults, when she was pregnant by HERSELF(MIRACLE) . Her mom wanted a boy so that he can clean the church(Remember the Holy Quran had other religions like Christianity(Prophet Isa, Jesus) and Jewdisum( Prophet Mosa, Moses).So in that time girls could not help in the church. So my dear friend I hope that you know about the strength of a woman! The system of Divorce in Islam is better because it give the couple more than one chance to be together, if he divorced her once, they can be together again if they want to. If they did and divorced for the second time then they can be together again if they want to, and if they are divorced for the 3rd time then they should be separated. Every man and woman has right to marry a person of his her choice . Islam is first one to give this right by making it mandatory to take consent from both in front of two witnesses. If a person is not happy with his her marriage , dont you think its their fundamental right to get away from the burden of that relation. Islam has given that right too. After you are separated both men and women has equal right to remarry and live a happy life. Does Islam give this right only to Men ? , no it gives equally to women. Lets come back to your question on divorce and rights of women. There are many ways of taking divorce . Triple talaq is worst . Women has right to take divorce as men has .Also she can put down her conditions during marriage that her husband has to fulfil else she can dissolve marriage. he has to follow normal divorce process provided by Islam which has waiting period of 3 months after arbitration , reconciliation. Allah has given many rights to women Right to marriage to a man of her choice She will financially sound once she enters her husband house as husband has to pay meher to her she can put her conditions to marry as she wont she wont allow husband for second marriage etc. there is no dowry system Girl family need not throw party for boys relative and family when they come for marriage. Boy family has to give reception , if they afford Women can take divorce if she is not happy with husband or husband does not fulfil promise made during marriage. There are many other rights reserved for women but they are denied as niether muslim men nor women are educated enough to know them. Islam is very easy religion to follow but followers are making it difficult Kindly read my answer Sabina Jamshed's answer to Today, a friend of mine asked, \u2018Why do you care about our triple talaq? Did we ever question your Hindu faith?\u2019 What's are your answers to these questions?",

I am fucking worried and my mind is flooded with unpleasant fantasies about her well being. She gets back home at 4:30 PM. I feel relieved seeing her. Conclusion:  I love her. I was worried sick the whole time. Scene two: I am traveling by train with my dad. Being stupid enough I did not put enough warm cloths. I am asleep. I feel cold. I am shivering. All on a sudden, after midnight I find myself rapped by a warm blanket. Dad shares his blanket with me. Conclusion : Dad loves me. Scene three: I take care of everyone. But I am let down by people whom I love. I decide to take give myself priority from next time. Conclusion:  I love myself. How do you know you love someone or not? You  show  them, you do not just tell. You show them by your actions not just by your words. Showing is much more important than telling. How do I know if I love someone? Why do I love someone I don't know? How do you know when someone does not love you? How do you know if you really love someone and are not just infatuated? How do you know they really love you, too? She is nice and pretty but not very smart. How can I tell her without hurting her? Well, here are some of the points to know whether you love someone or not Every small action of that person affects you You like to spend as much time with that person You always want him/her to see happy You can understand the mood of the person by seeing his/her face You always admire about the person while talking to others Hope you will found your loved one. Best wishes, Tapas I for one have felt that I can give my self completely to the person I loved. More on the sacrificial front. You won\u2019t have a second thought about doing anything for the person you love. In fact, he/she will become your priority. Hmm..can be a trick question sometimes ! well you can observe a few things for sure and should be able to answer whether you \u201clike\u201d or \u201c love\u201d the person. If you get bothered by the person\u2019s absence in your life. If you get hurt by the actions of the person. You want to hate them but you can\u2019t!! You want to share every moment of happiness and sorrow with this person. When you start to care and keep this person\u2019s needs and wishes before yours. All you want for them is to be happy, even if you are not a part of it. If you fight for that person no matter what! If you cannot put into words how this person makes you feel, damn !!!! you seriously love this person! You know what they say\u2026.if you can\u2019t get someone out of your head , may be they are supposed to be there !! All the very best!

TRANSLATION The Blessed Lord said: Time I am, destroyer of the worlds, and I have come to engage all people. With the exception of you [the Pandavas], all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain. PURPORT Although Arjuna knew that Krsna was his friend and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was nonetheless puzzled by the various forms exhibited by Krsna. Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force. It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even Brahma. Yasya brahme ca ksatram ca ubhe bhavata odanah/mrtyur yasyopasecanam ka ittha veda yatra sah. Eventually all the brahmanas, ksatriyas and everyone else are devoured by the Supreme. This form of the Supreme Lord is an all-devouring giant, and here Krsna presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time. Except for a few Pandavas, everyone who was present in that battlefield would be devoured by Him. Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight; then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is His plan. If he stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death cannot be checked, even if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord. That is the law of nature. So Krishna is time. Krishna is Supreme. If the above stated persons are able to travel through time then it implies they can control Krishna!! So time travel is impossible by any soul existing. Thanks for A2A Hare Krsna!! In the Mahabharat, how did Guru Drona die? Why do people believe in the Ramayana and the Mahabharat epics? Why do you believe in the Ramayana and the Mahabharat epics? How do I find a perfect guru? How many times \"Rama\" appears in Guru Granth Sahib? They are beyond time.

        "a": "At  Campus On Fire  we created a short guideline to building your future successful e-commerce business: 1. The Idea The internet is flush with what seemed like great ideas but were not properly vetted and thus failed.  (How many apps do you have on your phone now that you never use? ...Exactly.)  You need to know your target audience well and the study supply and demand in this area. Assuming you have a good idea for a e-commerce business a good rule of thumb to start with is \"Would you use it yourself and if so, how often?\" If you cannot honestly say you would use it often enough that once scaled it would be profitable, you need to realign your offering or abandon ship now before you burn through your friends' and family's money. If you are confident that you are, in fact, on to something big enough that you won't need to hide from Uncle Harry when he asks how his investment is going, then proceed. 2. Co-thinkers/co-founders You can omit this step if you already have a team or if you decided to build everything on your own. But if you do need a partner\u2014choose very carefully. This person should be really involved and share your point of view on the core issues. If you need technical cofounder, try these services  founderdating.com  ,  cofounderslab.com . 3. Detailed business plan. A well done business plan includes: General information: description of the business, market description, main competitors description Sales and marketing plan: promotion, advertising, distribution, pricing Operating plan Timetable and action plan Summary: brief summary on the project, financing required Financial plan, including cash-flow budget. 4. Tech team While finding a seasoned (available) top developer is not easy, putting together the right mix of developers is a really BIG deal. It\u2019s a talent in and of itself. Get it wrong and it will cost you dearly. We finally have our dream team together but it was a serious process. Because we work with start-ups, it was critical to get top-notch people who are both talented and creative/flexible. The payoff has been great though. Team compatibility has created a true lean mean machine allowing us to be very flexible in tackling all kinds of development projects. It's definitely something I think more people should inquire about before hiring a development team. 5. Wireframe This can make or break you. If you don't get it right from the start, you will be plagued with costly work arounds, rebuilds, and the like. A. You must know your market and how you see the user experience being must be clear. B. Then you need to work with a pro info architect who specializes in e-commerce development. The wireframe serves as your requirements doc. NOW is the time to nail down the details. It is a lot easier to erase a line on a blue print of a skyscraper before it is built than it is to move the building 1\" to the left after it's built. Do your moving now before the programming starts. Trust me on this one. 6. Funding AngelList . While filling out the profile is no small task, you realize in the doing of it that what they ask is, in fact, important you have lined up before asking for money. Once you have done that you can leverage your answers to go to other funders. 7. Development phase Depending on the option (off-the-shelf or custom built platform) you choose it may take 1 week \u2013 12 months of development. 8. The Launch After you have tested and QA'd the site and are confident that it is ready for prime time, it's time to leave the development site and it live. 9. User acquisition And you thought building the website was the hard part. ;) While now is the time to acquire the users, you want to start planning for this during the first phases of development so that you can hit the ground running on launch day. 10. Success! It's a process more than a destination. You want to watch user behavior, listen to their feedback\u2014both those who love it but especially those who don't and look for opportunities to iterate and make it the best e-commerce business in the space! How can I start an eCommerce business as a visitor in the U.S.? What are some potential low-cost businesses that can be started and operated by a teenager? How can I start an eCommerce business as just a beginner? How can I start eCommerce business with my own place in India? If you were to start an internet-based business today from scratch, what would it be? Presently, there are two ways to do it depending up on how you want to do it. Adding to the already existing Marketplaces If Goods then  Amazon  or  Flipkart  like websites If Services then  Munim.in , if it is for Company Registration Services or any other such marketplace like  Freelancer ,  Guru , for other services Creating your own E-commerce website. Now, you need to take this call whether you want reinvent the wheel or make the structure on the already invented wheel. For starting the e-commerce business professionally, again depending upon the size of the business, you may go for  Company Registration in India  to work formally and legally. If you are building your own e-commerce platform then this step is utmost important. Moreso, if you are also focused on building your brand, then it is highly advisable to go for  Trademark Registration  as well which will protect your brand. While there are many ecommerce ideas to launch a business in India,. The easiest way to start an ecommerce business is to use a platform for it. But First of all you decided , which type of ecommerce business you want to start. If you are looking for opening a multivendor ecommerce store like Amazon, Flipkart eBay, etc. where different merchants comes to sell products and store owner earns revenue through commission, then you can build it on platforms like  Yo!Kart  &  CS-cart . Or in case you simply want to sell things online (which means you need a single online store like Nike\u2019s or any other brand\u2019s online store), then  Shopify ,  BigCommerce  will be a good choice for you.",

        "a": "1. How do you set your Service Cost ? Costing Basis :  Most cleaning services charge on hourly basis for their initial visit, but may also charge by the project or by the number of employees they are going to sending to your company on daily or weekly basis according to your requirements. Hire a Flat Fee Charging Company :  You should hire a company that offers one flat fee as in comparison with per-hour charges. With a per-hour charge, you run the risk of the maids moving slower in order to collect a bigger paycheck. Find out if the cleaning service has a \"not to exceed this price\" clause. 2. How long has the cleaning service been in this profession? Find out how long the company has been around, and how long the employees have been with the business. A brand-new company (or an old company with allnew employees) may not be the best choice because they are less experienced in this profession. It is impertinent that you find out more about the company and the duration for which it has been around and their success and failure ratio. 3. Do you conduct a background check on employees? Does the cleaning service check employee background? Are employees criminal backgrounds checked? Is their residence status confirmed? Most reputable services perform background checks on all of their employees. Any commercial cleaning services company should screen their employees for drug use and verify that they do not have a criminal history. But even better, the best commercial office cleaning company will work hard to look for candidates that are a good fit. This can be done through personality testing. Additionally, verifying previous employment and checking references can go a long way to building a great team. 4. What kind of Quality Control Check do you possess for assuring reliability? Some professional commercial cleaning services companies consider INSPECTIONS as gold standard for quality control in the cleaning industry. Inspections bridge the gap between a facility manager and a cleaning company. Some best Office Cleaning Companies not only make liberal use of inspections, they use technology like apps, software and reporting to communicate the information gathered from inspections quickly and to the right people of cleaning company to adjust your service or handle an issue quickly. 5. Are you insured? Be assure about to check whether the cleaning company is insured or not about any accident or damage. Professional cleaning services will carry liability insurance and bond and have a policy in place in case something gets broken, damaged or goes missing in your office. You should verify coverage in order to give you peace of mind that your Commercial office cleaning company is adequately protected. General Liability Insurance  protects your assets against a variety of claims for alleged negligence or wrongdoing by your Cleaning Company. Workers Compensation Insurance  covers job-related accidents that injure, disable, or kill an employee. Workers Compensation Insurance covers employees at your place of business and during business related travelling. Automobile Liability Insurance  protects people and property from accidents that occur involving your cleaning company\u2019s auto fleet as they come and go from your business. 6. Are you well equipped? A company that believes in a high standard of customer service will work closely with you to ensure that your property is serviced by the right equipment. The company should service and maintain all its equipment at its own costs to guarantee that your property is well serviced. Also, make sure the janitorial services company stocks and supplies cleaning and paper products, bathroom supplies, garbage bags and lighting so that you are never out of supplies. 7. Do you possess customer satisfaction guarantee? Companies should welcome their customer\u2019s your suggestions and feedback. They should also be able to provide you with a satisfaction guarantee in the event that you are unhappy with a particular service. Ask what procedure is used to measure customer satisfaction. Do you ask customers to fill out a survey online or on paper? Will a manager contact me after my place of business cleaning to get my feedback? The steps taken to ensure your satisfaction will tell you a lot about how much they value their customers. You should be able to openly communicate with them by email or phone to ensure your cleaning needs are being met or not. Ask what cleaning services are included in a route visit by the cleaning service. If you would like to take the basic day-to-day chores and really want a housecleaner to take responsibility for regular dusting, cleaning, Window-washing, base board cleaning and floor scrubbing, make sure that you let them know about your expectations as it may affect the costing of cleaning service. Summary The 7 Things you should know before hiring a commercial cleaning service are mentioned above will give you and your business a great basic information and insights of cleaning industry. Implementing these techniques and understanding the needs of these techniques will prevent you by pain and suffering of surveying through hundreds of commercial cleaning services. Time, money and aggravation will be saved so you can choose the cleaning service that is best fit for your EXACT needs and budget. Remember that you are that you are going to choose the services which best fits your needs and keeping these seven points in your pocket will leave the game win.

Also, the scriptures of Islam contain plenty of support for this practice, and I know of no other major religion that teaches this. Some examples: Quran (4:89) - \"They wish that you should reject faith as they reject faith, and then you would be equal; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them, until they emigrate in the way of God; then,  if they turn their backs, take them, and slay them wherever you find them ; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper.\" Hadith Sahih Bukhari (52:260) - \"...The Prophet said, ' If somebody (a Muslim) discards his religion, kill him.'  \" Hadith Sahih Bukhari (83:37) - \"Allah's Apostle never  killed anyone except  in one of the following three situations: (1) A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed (in Qisas,) (2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and (3) a man who fought against Allah and His Apostle and  deserted Islam and became an apostate .\" Hadith Sahih Bukhari (84:57) - [In the words of] \"Allah's Apostle, ' Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him. '\" Hadith Sahih Bukhari (89:271) - A man who embraces Islam, then reverts to Judaism  is to be killed  according to \"the verdict of Allah and his apostle.\" So, Islam is fundamentally against freedom of religion, especially for those who once considered themselves Muslims. Of course, if you happen to be born in a country that\u2019s nearly 100% Islam, you will really not have a choice at all. Why do some people dislike Islam? Who are famous people to convert from Islam to atheism? Why are most Islamic countries intolerant of other people's religions? Why don't all Muslim women convert to a religion of their choice since Islam religion is heavily misogynistic in nature? What would happen the... 80% of U.S. prisoners who convert to a new religion convert to Islam. Why is Islam such a popular choice? Should anything be done about this? In Islamic countries, people can convert to other religions, they can even go for atheism but they are not allowed to criticize Islam after leaving it. In islamic countries,If someone converts to other religion, starts bashing the religion and the muslims who are following it, he is surely putting his life to danger. Depends on which Islamic country you want to ask. All \u2018Christian\u2019 countries are not the same. All Islamic countries are not the same.",

According to Agriculture ministry estimates, the production of the fruit in India has dropped by 40% from 8,000 metric tonnes in 2014-15 to around 5,000 metric tonnes in both 2015-16 and 2016-17. The reduced production was due to above normal winter temperature and issues concerning the mother plant imported from California to grow the fruit, said sources from the All India Strawberry Growers' Association. Mahabaleshwar is Maharashtra's major strawberry growing belt and according to the ministry's data, in a normal season, strawberries are grown on close to 2,000 acres of land in Mahabaleshwar. Close to 20,000 tonnes of strawberries are grown in and around Mahabaleshwar during a normal season, sinse the usual per-acre production stands at 7 to 10 tonnes. The president of the All India Strawberry Growers' Association, Nitin Bhilare said, \u201cThe yield has dipped by 40% over the last two years, primarily due to the warm winters in 2015 and 2016 as well as the non-availability of mother plants. To grow strawberries, each year Mahabaleshwar imports close to 7.5 lakh mother plants. But only four lakh such mother plants were imported in 2016.\u201c He also said that, as the warm winters are affecting the quality and causing a low yield, several farmers have refrained from planting strawberries. Mahabaleshwar strawberry is a seasonal fruit that grows in October-November and April-May. For a few months, temperatures in Mahabaleshwar have been fluctuating. In November, the hill station recorded its highest temperature (29\u00b0C) for the month in eight years. Senior coordinator of the Krishi Vigyan Kendra at Sadalpur, Sunil Dhanda said that, Saharwa village in Haryana's Hisar district, a major strawberry hub in North India, also saw a dip in its yield.",

        "a": "I hate to directly countermand other answers, but a bicycle chain staying in place on a diagonal chain run isn\u2019t directly dependent on a derailleur. If a derailleur was necessary for keeping a chain in place, then you would have to have a perfectly straight chain on single-speed bikes, which definitely isn\u2019t the case. So, if it\u2019s not the positioning of the derailleur, then what keeps the chain in place? The answer is  chain tension . When a chain is \u201cin\u201d a gear, the links of the chain are interlocked with the teeth of the gear, like so: When the chain changes gears or falls off of a gear, a certain number of pins have to clear first, which increases the required length of the chain, like so: If you have a single-speed bicycle, this action increases tension astronomically, and so as the chain catches and climbs the teeth, the increase in tension pulls it back down. A very bad chainline on a single-speed bike will cause the chain to catch on every single tooth, and pedaling will feel notchy, or like the chain is grinding. If you have a loose chain, then there might be enough slack to allow for shifting, and so it will tend to fall off. On a bicycle with gears, the length of chain mating with the gears changes as you shift. To accommodate this, the part of the rear derailleur where the chain routes is suspended on a spring that maintains tension as the size of the gears changes. Unfortunately, a standard derailleur tension mechanism only works while pedaling forward. This is why pedaling backwards in a strange combination of gears isn\u2019t smooth, and can sometimes cause unwanted shifts. Since some mountain bikes now have 1x11 setups with very strange chain angles, SRAM and Shimano have both developed derailleurs with clutched springs in them that allow for confident backpedaling. I'm 17 and my mom doesn't want me to go to school with the bicycle. Is that normal? What is the best way to clean bike chain? How tough are bicycle chains? Which is the most sold bike in India? What does it mean if my bike chain slips under load? The deraileurs limit the movement. The deraileurs limit lateral movement and then limit screws on the deraileurs prevent them from moving far enough for the chain to fall off the extreme cogs. If you are asking why the chain doesn't move cogs to fall into a straight line, rather than a diagonal. That's also the deraileurs. As well as limiting lateral movement, in any given gear the rear deraileurs take up the slack, or add slack, for the chain to be at the appropriate tension for that gear. A well set up rear deraileur shifting is almost hypnotic. The front and rear derailleur has a component called a  limit screw.  The limit screws limit how far the derailleur can derail the chain inwards or outwards. In other words, it limits the chain to prevent it from falling off the chainset. If not set up properly, chain can still fall off the chainset. For 1x setups, the chain will fall off without a front derailleur, but this problem can be fixed by using narrow-wide chainring or a chainguard. Agree with Louis. The chain tension and the direction of movement prevents it from coming off or dropping. This keeps it interlocked, but also only up to a certain angle. If tthe angle is too big, the chain will not engage or interlock with the teeth anymore and will be dropped.",

        "a": "Manchester United\u2019s summer transfer plans depend a lot on whether they win the Europa league and the uncertain futures of several of their stars. Goalkeeper : Despite Sergio Romero being excellent whenever he has played this season, United will need a new goalkeeper if David De Gea leaves for Real Madrid. United are being linked with Jan Oblak as De Gea\u2019s replacement and would not look out of place considering the top level experience he has had over the last 2\u20133 years. Centre Back : While Eric Bailly has been imperious, a lack of a consistent centre back partner has hurt United at times. For all the talent of Smalling and Jones, they have proven time and again that they keep making basic errors and/or are injury prone. A centre-back has to be priority this summer. One of the names linked around in Benfica centre half Victor Lindelof, but I would personally prefer to see United buy back  Micheal Keane . Keane has been excellent and being a former youth team player, knows United through and through. Plus he has good Premier League experience and should not take too much time to settle Central Midfield : Paul Pogba and Ander Herrera have been excellent at times this season but United need one more Central midfield player who can take over some of the defensive duties from the duo. United have been linked with  Eric Dier , who might fit in pretty well. Dier has lost his place to Victor Wanyama and if the right offer arrives, Spurs would allow him to leave. As an added bonus, Dier has the ability to play Centre back as well as Right back. Forwards : With Wayne Rooney almost certain to leave and Zlatan\u2019s future unclear, United are in the market for atleast a wide forward/No 10 and a centre forward.  James Rodriguez  has been mentioned as a potential signing and could take the No 10 jersey from Rooney but the most eye catching name bandied around is  Antoine Griezmann . Griezmann is versatile enough to play pretty much anywhere in attack and is one the rare players who combine hardwork with elegance and if United pull off his signing, they have got themselves a coup. With Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial already in the squad, Griezmann would be in good company as well. These players joining United is heavily dependent on whether Man Utd make the champions league Do you think Bale will join Manchester United this summer? I am 18. How can I join a professional club academy like FC United of Manchester? Can I play with the youth team? What are the pros and cons if James Rodriguez were to join Manchester United? How does a Manchester United fan feel? Will Manchester United fans riot if Rooney is not sold this summer? Well who I think will join and who I want to join are two different things but I'll just say who I think will probably be bought, not who I think should be bought. Now I think Moutinho will target at least 4 positions like he did last summer. I think these positions will be a center back, a left back, a center mid and an attacker Centre Back:  Now there are a few different people being linked such as  Lindelof  as well as  Dier , but I'm pretty confident that Mourinho will go for  Michael Keane.  I think there are some terms in his contract which give us a small discount and I think Mourinho will want to go for a ball playing defender who is calm on the ball, to partner Bailly\u2019s aggression. Left Back:  Now I'm not completely sure if Mourinho will go for a left back, but if he is not going to play Shaw than we must get a now and established left back, instead of playing Blind, Darmian or Young who are not used to playing there. If we do go for a left back the main option I think we will sign would be  Benjamin Mendy.  He has been impressive for Monaco this season and seems the most likely left back target. Centre Mid:  I think Moutinho will be keen after schweinsteiger and schneiderlin leaving. I would say he will go for someone more defensive minded player, like  Bakayoko  or  Dier , who I mentioned earlier but can play in either of the positions. He could also go for a more attacking option such as  Bernardo Silva  or  James Rodriguez,  who seems to be the most heavily linked and could definitely be at united next year. I'm not completely sure on this position, I think this position is difficult to predict as there are so many options. Versatile Attacker:  Finally, I am pretty sure that Mourinho will go for someone who will help improve the goal, a versatile attacker in particular. In the last traansfer market, Mourinho was interested in signing Thomas Muller, however he was put off by his price and we probably won't go for him as he has not been at his best this season. However Muller does essentially dum up the mound of player Mourinho is looking for. A player who is hard working, works well with his team-mates, can play in any attacking position on the pitch and will guarantee goals no matter where he is playing. This kind of player is rare and while they are not the same, I think Mourinho will make a transfer for  Antoine Griezmann.  Griezmann fits that description relatively well and offers other things such as his pace and intelligent runs. The speculation has cooled down in recent weeks however i still believe he will join in the summer.",

Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer Fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets , which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics . His paper was followed by the 1944 book  Theory of Games and Economic Behavior , co-written with Oskar morgenster , which considered cooperative games of several players. This theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. Game theory was later explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. With the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics science going to game theorist Jean Tirole in 2014, eleven game-theorists have now won the economics Nobel Prize.John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize  for his application of game theory to biology.

However, Senior House currently is still part of the MIT list of residence halls and the first year (freshman) choice takes place, as always, during orientation:  First Year Residence Exchange (FYRE)  Therefore, nothing has to be done until then. If another 30 rooms open up due to exiting seniors, MIT could choose to move in some upper class transfer students or others who want to relocate, and keep freshman from senior house for another year. However, MIT will maintain Senior House as a residence hall. There are not enough \u201cbedrooms\u201d in Cambridge to do anything truly drastic.

        "a": "The answer lies in the question. \u2018No Means No\u2019. As Big B rightly said, \u201c\u2018No.\u2019 It itself is a statement and doesn\u2019t ask for any further remark or explanation.\u201d If a girl, anyone for that matter, says \u2018NO\u2019, we must respect it; we should stop at once. If she/he wants it to be stopped, it should be stopped. I am writing about both the sexes, because this dialogue also applies on other forms of sexual abuse apart from rape. A no should not be met by force or further pestering. One must respect the call and abort the activity. *Alert: Bringing in the Indian perspective* But all the Bollywood  masala  teaches an average youth is that the girl/boy is asking for it. She\u2019s/He\u2019s into BDSM stuff. She/He wants more and they want you to force them. Since, the average youth in India doesn\u2019t have friends of opposite sex, they don\u2019t know anything about their sexual behaviour or fantasies, they tend to think that the movie was right. They should indeed force. They think that a \u2018NO\u2019 means \u2018I want it more\u2019. No. No means No. The day this average youth understands the meaning of NO, all sexual abuses would stop at once. But will that day come? I said \u2018NO\u2019 many times when I was a child to the physical and sexual abuse. They did not understand. They gifted me several moments worth thousand nightmares for the rest of my life. Karma has served them well today. I hope that \u2018Humanity Heals\u2019 someday. The Yarn Spinner. What exactly does a movie producer do? What is the most iconic Hindi movie dialogue you have ever heard? Which movies have the best ending? What are some great Bollywood movie dialogues, which either entertain you, or inspire you, or motivate you? What are some unforgettable evergreen dialogues in Hollywood? There is a metaphorical/poetical saying when a woman says \u2018no\u2019 it means \u2018yes\u2019 There are number of songs,jokes,poems regarding the same in Indian culture. Lot of men who take advantage of women when they say \u2018NO\u2019 as an 'YES' justifying themselves that as consentment. So the dialogue speaks for itself, IF-SHE-SAYS-NO-IT-MEANS-NO. There is no other meaning to derive and NO ambiguity in the situation. Here, in Indian society there are lot of complications regarding the relationship between a man and a woman;be the physical one or the mental relationship. Here many of them (not saying everyone boys)want only physical intimacy (in case of a relationship)and never cares to bother about the feelings of a girl. There can be inconvenience for a girl to not agree to what a man says. A Good man will try to understand her and the immatured ones try to dominate her at the cost of her disagreement. So by saying \u2018No\u2019 it means a clear choice of refusing an option given. Nothing more beyond that. It means as the same \u2018No\u2019 said by men.

It\u2019s Not Open For Interpretations.\u201d Though it was used in a movie in context to sexual exploitation ,think of other hundreds of important matters ,like corruption ,poverty, malnutrition,adulteration ,cow vigilantism and many other issues ,what about a no to such things which are eating out our country chronically ,what about weight age of this word no to such things, is it practised the way it should be at all the required places ,just if a director made a movie and portrayed girl harassment over there ,it doesn't undermines the other more important issues corroding the country ,sad truth is the count of people who go to movies in our country is more than those who read newspaper ,so be realistic  NO IS A NO AT EVERY PLACE BE IT ANY MATTER OF IMPORTANCE ,DONT FALL PREY TO DIRECTORS TRIGGERING YOUR INTELLECT TO THE ISSUE WHICH ARE THERE BUT,FAR MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES EXIST THAT NEED TO BE LOOKED UPON",

Do not stop drinking water, that is the worst thing you could possibly do. Anyways, I doubt you will have adverse effects. Fasting is generally healthy. Only if you drop below 5\u20136% body fat (if you are a male) do you need to worry. Here is what 5\u20136% (if you are a male) body fat looks like: At 78kg, as you said, I am not sure you need to fast for 14 days. I would stay under 7. Drink lots of water while you fast. Before you start, read this  beginner\u2019s guide to fasting. Are 20-day water fasts dangerous? What would the effect of a 30-day water fast be? How dangerous are 7 day water fasts? What is it like to do a ten day water fast? Can I fast for 3 day with only water? How much weight could I lose if I am female and weigh 128 pounds? People that tell you that you will not lose weight fasting for a week don't know what they are talking about . For a real world answer just watch Naked And Afraid , I've seen people lose 30 + pounds on 21 days . I started a fast yesterday and will continue it until I lose at least 10 pounds , probably 7 to 10 days . During my fast I will eat about 100 calories a day just to keep my digestion track working , but that's it no more than that . Don't worry about mussle loss , when the body thinks it's starving it produced large amount of groth homone to compensate . Good luck with your fast . http://ybet168com.net Disclaimer: If you've asked me this question thinking I'm a medical doctor, I'm NOT. You haven't mentioned the reason for your water fast. If you're doing it for weight loss, it Will work but: It would be better for health and easier to lose weight with proper nutrition. Fasting weight usually returns within a short time. With proper nutrition, the weight loss can be relatively long term. If you're doing it for religious purposes, ensure that you have the right understanding about the why and how of fasting, enlist support from people around you i.e. family / friends / neighbours..

The CTA fare from O'Hare into the city is $5, and allows 1 transfer to a bus or train line, so it\u2019s about 1/3rd of what a shuttle bus from O'Hare might charge, and 10\u201320% of what a cab into the \u201cloop\" (downtown Chicago) would cost. All other CTA elevated and subway trains (and busses) cost $2.25, regardless of distance. Fare card machines don't give change back, so make sure you have a $5 bill or 5 singles, if you just want to pay the one-time fare into downtown. Also see the CTA website,  www.transitchicago.com . The CTA O'Hare blue line trains run 24 hours, with trains every 4\u20138 minutes during rush hour and every 8\u201320 minutes during other times. Trains are not usually crowded when they leave O'Hare, but can become very crowded before reaching downtown (16 miles), so pick a location at either end of the railcar, where your luggage won't block any extra seats. (Ask at your hotel where to pick up the train back to O'Hare when leaving, so that you are more likely to get a seat.) Busses give a 25\u00a2 discount when you use a fair card instead of paying cash. CTA rail lines will permit free transfers to other rail lines at certain stations, otherwise, each transfer costs 25\u00a2, charged to a CTA fare card when you board the next bus or train within 2 hours or less after paying a fare on an earlier bus or train (up to 2 additional rides within 2 hrs). The CTA offers daily and multiday passes when you arrive, or you can go to the  ventracard.com  website to open a transit account and then request a card but mail and/or download their iPhone or Android app, to use your new acct, to pay fares.  Ventra App | Ventra Any references at the ventra website to pace busses and metra are to regional suburban commuter bus and rail lines, which may not be relevant, if you don't have business or sidetrips planned to the Chicago Suburbs. O'Hare is an in-city location. Why is public transportation so bad in the U.S.? Is the Chicago public transportation system any good? What is the average driving time between Chicago and New York, and how does the public transportation system in these cities compare to Boston... Why does the USA have a very poor public transport system compared to other developed countries? What cities in India are the best in public transport? The elevated train system is color coded and easy to understand. The bus system is a more complex. Look at the CTA website and plan out your route in advance. It\u2019s not cheap, but you can buy multi-ride passes at the train stations and other places. All these answers are great I just wanted to add one tidbit on price. There is a  small fee  for not having a ventra card and purchasing some of the singles pass that everyone left out If you order a ventra card ahead of time or have a bank with wireless pay enabled you don\u2019t have to pay the disposable media fee which can bring your price up from $2.25 to $3.  CTA Fare Information  search media fee. Ordering the ventra card ahead of time is \u201cfree\u201d they give you a $5 refund of the card fee to your first fare which would most likely be the $5 ride from O\u2019hare. When I ordered mine I actually got the card and $5 free for no charge. Looks like it might be slightly different now Yes, it is fairly easy to understand and inexpensive. The Train at O\u2019Hare is really easy as you can only get on one train and it just goes one direction from O\u2019Hare. The rest of the trains and buses are also really simple. The buses are easy because they mostly just stick to one street and don\u2019t have complex routes. They don\u2019t go from one place to another place like in some cities but rather for the most part just go up and down a single street. The CTA trains are color coded. When you land in O'Hare there's only one train (Blue Line) that goes into the city. It's really simple to navigate. Just use maps on your smart phone and you will be able to navigate rather simple.",

        "a": "There are some situations where you may have money \u201con\u201d a credit card, or a negative balance on your account, which basically means the credit card company owes you money. This could happen if: you overpay your bill you pay your bill in full then make a return If you have a negative balance, that balance will be applied to future purchases. If that negative balance remains for 6 months and you don\u2019t use it, the credit card company will mail you a check. You can also make a written request that they pay the money back to you, and they\u2019re legally required to refund it within seven days of your request. You could then deposit that check in your bank account, and there would be no fees for this whole process. Assuming you don\u2019t have a negative balance on your credit card, there is no money  on  your credit card to transfer to a bank account.  A credit card is a line of credit, which means when you buy things the credit card company pays for it and expects you to pay them back. Your credit limit is the amount the bank will lend on your behalf until you pay them back. This does not mean there is money available to you in an account that you can transfer somewhere, it\u2019s just the amount of the revolving loan you can use for purchases. Some credit cards allow you to borrow cash (or cash equivalents) against your credit card account. This is known as a cash advance.  Cash advances come with very high fees, and demonstrate to the lender that the cardholder is being irresponsible with money.  If someone is so desperate for cash that he or she needs to borrow it from a credit card company, it likely means the person will not have any cash to pay it back right away. Because the credit card company is taking a huge risk by loaning the cash, the fees are very high. If you\u2019re talking about borrowing money as a cash advance and depositing it into a checking account without any fees, that\u2019s not possible. Credit card companies are not dumb enough to allow someone to do that because it\u2019s too risky.

Because if it is not, its velocity can be anything. If its acceleration is uniform, the exercise should state it as such. In that case, the problem can be solved by simple arithmetic\u2026 if the speed changes from 10 units to 20 units in 5 seconds, how much does it change in 1 second? Come on, you really don\u2019t need a calculator for this. A particle moves from the position of rest and attains a velocity of 30m/s. What will the acceleration be after 10 seconds? A projectile is launched with an initial velocity of 30m/s at an angle 60\u00b0 above horizontal. What is the velocity after 5 seconds? A stone is thrown vertically upward with a velocity of 19.6 m/s. After 2 seconds, another stone is thrown upwards with a velocity of 9.8 m/s. ... The velocity of light is 3X10^8 m/s. how can this velocity be applied to both wave and particle situation? What is the velocity of the body over the 1st 50 seconds? Is this velocity constant? You can\u2019t tell. It could be anything less than the speed of light. If you make some assumptions about the forces the particle is experiencing to change its velocity you can answer it. Otherwise not. It\u2019s like asking: f(3) = 7, what is f(1)? The question is incomplete. But if we assume the movement as linear. We can solve this. First you need to find the acceleration. So use the given information and put that to the equation ( l hope you know the equations for linear movement) [math]V=u+at[/math] [math]20=10+a\u00d75[/math] [math]a= \\dfrac{20-10}{5}[/math] [math]a=2ms^{-2}[/math] Now you know the acceleration. The question is to find the velocity 3 seconds before. So the ending velocity is  [math]10ms^{-1}[/math] So use the same equation. [math]V=10ms^{-1}[/math] ;  [math]t=3s[/math] ;  [math]a=2ms^{-2}[/math]   [math]u=?[/math] [math]V=u+at[/math] [math]10=u+2\u00d73[/math] [math]10-6=u[/math] [math]u=4ms^{-1}[/math] Answer is B Don't put your homework to quora. You have to think and solve. it has taken 5 seconds to accelerate by 10m/s so 10/5=2m/s\u00b2 so assuming that the acceleration remains constant 2x3=6m/s of velocity change in 3 seconds 10\u20136= 4m/s :)",

        "a": "Since you write about the \u201cEast Coast\u201d having fought against \u201cthe South\u201d in the Civil War, I am guessing your version of the East Coast stops somewhere in the vicinity of Delaware, and does not include East Coast places like Savannah, Jacksonville, and Virginia Beach. If this is the case, it\u2019s probably just a matter of the fact that folks in the northern parts of the East Coast usually have worse winters than those in the southern parts. While Bostonians and New Yorkers rarely enjoy being under two feet of dirty snow for a month, or having our nose hairs freeze solid the minute we take our first breath out of doors, we can at least get a little schadenfreude out of watching Atlanta or the District of Columbia gasp in horror and grind to a halt for three days thanks to a three inch snowfall or out of listening to Floridians complain that it\u2019s soooooo cold out when it gets below sixty. Don\u2019t take it personally, it\u2019s just a different way of whining about our weather without wanting to seem whiny. And if it still bothers you, I recommend waiting until we\u2019re sweltering in the summer heat and just showing up going, \u201cbut it is so nice outside!\u201d Or showing up in shorts in January because you\u2019re actually from Montana or northern Minnesota, and as far a you\u2019re concerned, any temperature without a minus sign in front of it is downright balmy. Original question: Why do East Coasters think they're tough? I tend to notice that a lot of East Coasters tend think of people in other parts of the country as not as hardened as them. This is interesting since the last time the East Coast fought a war against the South in the Civil War, they lost a fair amount of the battles. Do you think the DDoS attack on the East Coast could be a more wide spread problem that could happen again? Do Californians jaywalk less than East Coasters? Should I tell my cousin he is biologically not his father\u2019s son, when he thinks he is? We\u2019re in our 50\u2019s. Do you think Trump will be re-elected as a president? Why do some Americans think America has to be the best in the world? Probably because you\u2019re talking to children and/or idiots. The vast majority of grown-ups, be they located on the east coast, west coast, or somewhere in-between - don\u2019t \u201cthink they\u2019re tough\u201d outside the military, and they don\u2019t base that on location.* It\u2019s simply not something mature adults think about or care about. *The rivalry between Marines from PI and Hollywood Marines from San Diego is exempted from this observation. It\u2019s good natured ribbing between actual warriors and really has no context for civilians. I live in the East coast, so I am qualified to answer the question. East coasters don't think they are tough because of military or for winning the civil war. They think they are tougher than people who live in the Sun belt because they deal with rough winters. News articles that report Atlanta or Raleigh being shut down due to couple of inches of snow confirm that perception. This is all in fun and not to be taken serious. That \u201cEast Coasters\u201d think they\u2019re \u201ctough\u201d is a gross generalization. I\u2019ve lived on the East Coast my entire life and I\u2019ve met plenty tough and not tough people.

        "a": "That\u2019s Charlie. Charlie lived feral in the desert for about half or more of his first year- and he survived. So what does Charlie do when the coyotes cry? Charlie goes quiet. He stays where he is, or jumps up in a chair, and he stays vewy, vewy quiet. Which is the exact opposite of the rest of his canine pack who all start barking their fool heads off. Lucy yips and sounds like a ferocious bunny rabbit, Teddy has a surprisingly deep bark but it doesn\u2019t carry, and is a lot of effort to boot, probably a waste of calories, so there\u2019s not too much effort once we say stop, and Lukas barks deep and LOUD while sticking his slimy, wet nose on the windows he can reach. Which is most of them. *sigh* Once they hear the command \u201cNo barking in the house!\u201d they stop, although there are grumblings about this- they feel we aren\u2019t taking coyotes seriously, because it\u2019s pretty clear coyotes are a threat one way or another. What if they broke into our house and ate all the treats in the Magic Cupboard? That horror is too much to contemplate and certainly deserves the ruckus of a good bark-fest. But, well, No Barking means No Barking, so\u2026 *sigh* *with doggy breath* But back to Charlie. Charlie goes quiet because Charlie learned if he stays quiet, and the coyotes haven\u2019t caught his scent, chances were good he wouldn\u2019t have to run for his life. And Charlie\u2019s pretty good at running for his life- he survived. So, if you are a small animal- say the size of Charlie up to maybe 50 pounds or so- you stay quiet, and ready to run for your life, literally. If you\u2019re bigger than that, though, you are pretty much safe. Coyotes are clever, and that means they are calculating. Unless an animal is young or weak, coyotes can do the survival algebra in their heads fast enough to leave anything which can truly hurt them alone- they don\u2019t like to have to fight too hard for their food. After all, there\u2019s a rabbit or ground squirrel up the road a ways just waiting to be invited to dinner. So, for a human, hearing a coyote means stay alert so you don\u2019t get spooked when one silently appears out of the clump of bushes right in front of you, but that\u2019s about it. If you see one close enough, just puff yourself up big and make a lot of noise, he (or they) will turn away and trot off, looking back at you from a safe distance. Unless you have a little dog with you on a leash. Then you scoop the dog up, make yourself big, make a lot of noise, and head back to the house- they likely wouldn\u2019t attack, but coyotes are clever, and hunger is a sharp and mean driver. What do you do if you are surrounded by a pack of coyotes (we live by a pack and we have chickens)? What are coyotes doing when you can hear them howling/cackling/mewling in the middle of the night? Who would win in a fight, a dog or a coyote? What kind of dogs can a coyote fight with? Do coyotes eat small dogs or only kill them? Roll over and go back to sleep. Our coyotes really only \u201csing\u201d for a few weeks in the spring\u2026 all night\u2026 when they are making baby coyotes. They are around all of the time but ours is a pretty well-integrated semi-urban pack. Meaning they don\u2019t seem to jump fences, and while a free-range chicken or outdoor cat might vanish, they\u2019ve never threatened a dog or human of any size. I make sure the cats are in.",

Fauvism is a better understood term referring to an early 20th C group of painters who used bright colours. Impressionism was the forerunner of colourism, and you could also put expressionism in there too, on the abstract side. What are some designs that vividly connect mathematics and art? I always fail to understand various paintings in art exhibitions. Most of them appear to be random splash of colors. How do I understand them?... How can I make the color aqua using other colors?

They seem to be \u2018pastiches\u2019 of German Expressionism if one can call them that, although without the \u2018beginnings\u2019 of abstraction common to much early-twentieth century art. A couple of examples are below; is this what you mean? Franz Marc:  Der Tiger  (The Tiger) Franz Marc:  Blaues Pferd 1  (Blue Horse 1) Wasily Kadinsky:  Amsterdam Or you could try another early twentieth century movement, \u2018les Fauves\u2019, who emphasised strong and bold (mainly primary) colour and include such artists as Derain, (pre-Cubist) Braque, early Matisse and Kees van Dongen.

For example, if you are providing remote assistance to them via phone, email or some other online method, you could set expectations by: creating a single place for all documentation, to avoid the back-and-forth, and to stop them living out of their inbox; and setting a fixed time each week (or every two weeks) when you meet. Also, if their unreliability is to do with payment (sounds like it), then kill off any payments that are post the work. In other words, ask for 100% up front, negotiated down to 50% if they push back. If they don\u2019t trust you, then you\u2019re not a good fit. If this is a services-based business, ask yourself whether you are seriously undercharging.

        "a": "Taken from Wikipedia :) Cortical bone , synonymous with compact bone, is one of the two types of bone tissue that form bones. Cortical bone forms the extremely hard exterior of bones. Cortical bone facilitates bone's main functions: to support the whole body, protect organs, provide levers for movement, and store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. As its name implies, cortical bone forms the  cortex , or outer shell, of most bones. Cortical ( compact ) bone is much denser than cancellous bone. Furthermore, it is harder, stronger and stiffer than cancellous bone. Cortical bone contributes about 80% of the weight of a human skeleton. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical bone is the  osteon . Cancellous bone  is synonymous with trabecular or spongy bone. Cancellous bone has a higher  surface area to mass ratio  than  cortical bone  because it is less dense. This makes it softer, and weaker but more flexible. The greater surface area also makes it suitable for metabolic activities such as the exchange of calcium ions. Cancellous bone is typically found at the ends of long bones, near to joints and within the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous bone is highly  vascular  and frequently contains red  bone marrow  where  haematopoiesis , the production of blood cells, occurs. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone is the  trabecula . The trabeculae are aligned towards the mechanical load distribution that a bone experiences within long bones such as the  femur . As far as short bones are concerned, trabecular alignment has been studied in the  vertebral   pedicle . [2] The macroscopic  yield  strength of cancellous bone has also been investigated, using high resolution computer models. [3] The words  cancellous  and  trabecular  refer to the tiny lattice-shaped units (trabeculae) that form the tissue. It was first illustrated accurately in the engravings of  Cris\u00f3stomo Martinez . [4] When do various bones stop growing? Are bones in dogs the same as human bones? Are teeth the same as bones? Is the \"funny bone\" a real bone? Which is formed first, bones or cartilage? Or do they form simultaneously? Are bones and cartilage the same thing? They all describe bones of different designs of architecture which are specialised for different stages of growth and different sites in the body.",

Develop a laser=like focus for one project. Let's say you want to start an e-commerce business. Break that into smaller pieces and focus on each piece with everything you've got. If you don't, you could get quickly overwhelmed, get burnt out and decide to quit before you really begin. Eventually, you'll be able to hire people to do some of the smaller things (think of these jobs as the $10 an hour jobs you would pay someone to do) to make things easier and allow you to focus on the $20, $30, $40, and $50 an hour jobs until you work up to the $100 jobs you should be focusing on to grow your business.

        "a": "Hello, Since being a 10 year\u2019 student of Shaolin Kung Fu under the teaching of a Chinese master, and learning business online from my mentors, I may safely say that there no real special term for what you describe. Maybe you can create one ))) But in usual terms, it is called \u201c indirect instruction \u201d or as you said it \u201c indirect approach \u201d. An old proverb says: \"Tell me and I forget, show me and I remember, involve me and I understand.\" The teaching of giving simple clues, concepts, inquiries, and problem solving are all different forms of indirect instruction which actively involve the student, protege or learner in seeking answers or solutions to questions and issues from their mentor, thus constructing new knowledge. Indirect instruction or approach is a way of teaching and learning in which the process is inquiry, the content involves concepts, and the context is a problem to be resolved. Great teachers and mentors usually use both direct and indirect instructions, a little of direct approach at times and most of the time an indirect approach which is widely accepted as the best practice. I learned Kung Fu and business with indirect instructions. It takes longer, but you can retain better and have your own thinking of drawing results. With a  direct instruction , which is good at certain points when learning, students or proteges are given clear learning goals and explanations of the skills and information needed for the learning. When  indirect instruction  is used, the teacher, master or mentor presents information to his/her students, proteges or learners so that they may think, make and construct their own conclusions and assimilate the information in a way that makes sense to them. An example of this would be when a student or protege is given the opportunity to participate in a leadership role such as teaching a beginner\u2019s class, or creating his/her own marketing website. An evolved student should be able to put indirect instruction into knowledge which in turn puts it into practice in a way that is relevant and experiential for him or her. Indirect instruction is not the easiest approach but it is a way that will make you think, sometime for very long before you get the solution or understand the concept taught. Again, I believe that by engaging more than one approach, but mix both will enabling him or her to develop the skills necessary for self-directed learning. I would not have made the choice of \u201c Karate kid  \u201c to interpret this but rather the Kung Fu movie \u201c The 36th chamber of Shaolin \u201d with Gordon Liu which represents much better that concept of indirect approach. Hope it answers your question. If I can be of further assistance, do get in touch. Check my bio or learn \"Who is Sergei\"  Sergei VanBellinghen  Visit my Website (coming soon)  http://www.sergeivanbellinghen.com Thank you!!! What is the most difficult concept to grasp in physics? What does a girl do if she likes a boy? Does she approach him directly? How do I explain the concept of inertia to a kid? What are some of the most difficult concepts for doctors to grasp? As an Indian girl, do you like to be approached directly or indirectly? Not sure if there's a term for this, but this question reminds me of the maintenance guy that came to fix my dishwasher last year. This gentleman brought his son with him. \u201cDo this,\u201d he told his son. \u201cNow do this,\u201d he says. And so forth. \u201cI'm curious why you don't explain why, or the purpose of your instructions,\u201d I commented. \u201cHe doesn't need to know why,\u201d was the reply. \u201cHe just needs to follow instructions.\u201d I thought this peculiar. \u201cWhy\" allows one to approach similar situations with some way hope of navigating to a solution. Maybe I'm unusual in this respect. If I'm taught \u201cremove this screw and this screw.\u201d on model x, should I encounter another model x, I know what to do. Should I encounter model y, without knowing the why of those screws, I am lost. If instead one is taught, \u201cFirst, turn off water. Second, remove water hose.\u201d Then when looking at model y I at least have a framework of how to go about servicing model y. Oh, the water hose looks different, but I can reason out that the screws are located here. In the case of martial arts, it's not as clear cut, as you want to instill muscle memory, making actions a reflex. They are definitely two different ways of learning and I suppose it might depend on the context and the student. This didn't answer the question but I hope presented a contrast for discussion. I might term the former, learning a process, the latter, learning an algorithm.",

        "a": "There's a difference between thinking and just letting thoughts come into your head. The former is an active process while the latter is passive. Actively thinking about something beyond the point where you feel you've thought it through as much as possible could be due to fear of being out of control concerning whatever it is that has you preoccupied, or it could be a sort of mental inertia where having thought intensely about something has left you feeling compelled to keep thinking about it. Also, sometimes when you think long and hard in order to come up with a solution to a problem, and then actually do come up with a nice solution, it brings about a sense of euphoria, something you might be trying to reachieve making you into a dopamine junkie. I am 15. I am an overthinker who keeps on thinking what people think of me. What should I do? I'm driving myself to insanity with over-thinking, self-analysis, self-doubt, self-loathing, internal misery and zero action. What the heck ca... Is it possible for two people to like each other but have nothing to talk about? Is it possible that some people are good at nothing? Why should I be nice to people if I have nothing to gain from this? Some people are paralyzed at the thought of making a decision. Other people have analytic personalities and need to have every detail before they make a decision. I am not sure that I would quality their process as being \u201cfor nothing\u201d they have their reasons. Here are some ways to overcome \u201cover thinking\u201d\u2026.  10 Simple Ways You Can Stop Yourself From Overthinking I have been accused of this. Usually by stupid people. I have also been accused of paranoia. Also by the same stupid people. I am an INTJ-A (\u201carchitect\u201d) personality type. I am constantly thinking. It doesn't really ever switch off. I am NOTICING. I am PAYING ATTENTION. I figure things out first usually or I have a better understanding of how they work than the people around me. Probing the defensive lines of a problem. Using any method to assimilate information. Pictures in my head. Attack patterns. Drawing on an ecclectic pool of life experience and information. I'm doing it right now. I see the images from Jurassic Park where the dinosaurs are testing the fence periodically and the one night the power cuts out they break through. I have a feeling of the storm around me. I'm remembering a few days ago when I saw a squirrel in the morning and my mind saw all the veins and arteries glowing with the fluid and as the skin peeled back to the muscles the bone was showing through and as the muscles peeled back I exploded the view like a car manual and froze the squirrel in time in my head. All of that to answer this simple question. I do not view it as overthinking. I view it as thinking. Period. Not being able to cut through that process with a decision is insecurity though. Trying to pick a pair of shoes with that process shouldn't result in a ten minute decision. I have grown to where I wield this thought process like a sword. Those shoes will be picked the second I walk in the closet and if I'm still not sure then they get checked one more time in the mirror before I head out the door. I do a similar thing with body positioning, strangers, and public places. Nobody would know I was doing it unless I told them or they were conciously trying to outmaneuv me\u2026 in which case we have a problem. :o Is it actually  for nothing , or is it because they simply perceive a situation/task/etc to be more complex than what it is, thus thinking beyond what is actually required?",

Remember a very high SPF sunscreen will be one of your best investments while you\u2019re down here. Also in Florida, the further inland you are from the Gulf or Atlantic, the hotter it is. Inland Central Florida is a combination of a sub-tropical prairie and sub-tropical hardwood forest. So it\u2019s pretty hot down here, and remember that Orlando sits smack in the middle of a sub-tropical prairie. During the summertime there are very few breezes until the afternoon storms start rolling in, and the humidity runs upwards of 90% after it stops raining. So visit in the fall, after it cools down a bit, you won\u2019t regret it. How can a Philadelphia tourist survive the summer heat? How do I survive the Indian heat in summer? How do I overcome heat in the summer? How is the Tokyo summer heat? How can I complain about the civil registry? Because the summer in Florida is very unhealthy and miserably unpleasant from June to October day and night, in addition to the risk of hurricane: High humidity makes it impossible to keep cool without air-conditioning since, unlike in dry desert climates, there is no evaporative cooling effect if one sweats or applies water to the body. Outdoor activities can lead to heatstroke, at worse, and the discomfort, embarrassment of drenching sweat,at best. The extra heat generated by the millions of cars and air-conditioners only exacerbates the climatic discomfort. There is no nightly reprieve as in desert climates (where it usually cools down dramatically with lack of cloud cover) since Florida\u2019s nighttime lows in summer are above 80 F., making sleep very restless. There are no trade winds, unlike further south in the Caribbean. Mosquitoes, once only a nuisance, are now a health risk bearing Dengue Fever, Zika, Chikungunya and other potentially serious viral diseases. I have lived in Florida most all of my life. Yet the one thing that is hard to live with are the three summer months of July, August and part of September. Yet I see tourists flocking to Florida during these months and of course they are miserable if they are outside. Disney World can be a miserable experience then\u2026.when the temps crwal into the high 90\u2019s and the humidity right along with the temperature. Fair skin sunburns in just a few minutes. Canadians in particular seem to really complain about the heat during the summer here in Florda. It would be like me visiting Montreal in January and complaining about the Cold. Just a pet peeve of mine. If you are coming from the north to visit us during the summer months, you will enjoy the beaches, just be prepared for the heat, bring lots of sunscreen and dont complain about it. Dont visit Disney. Because they're people. People always find something to complain about.",

In an extreme gravitation field - like that of a black hole - the effect on sound waves is similar to the effect on electromagnetic waves. Just as light falling down a gravitational field increases in frequency, so too will sound that falls down a gravitational field increase its frequency. This is a general-relativistic effect though sound is a different in that it is the propagation of a pressure wave through a medium of particles. 'Matter' - like gas and other particles falling in will reach the speed of light at the event horizon. Sound waves will speed up, and in the process, there is an upward shift in frequency (doppler effect) maxing out at around 2 MHz or so. For observers, the sound is receding and so there is a downward shift of frequencies resulting in the wavelength stretching to millions of kilometers. This may occur even at a fraction of the speed of light. What is the speed of sound at the center of a black hole? Does a black hole exist in the universe? If so, what is the proof? Does a black hole rotate? If so, at what speed? What might falling into into a black hole feel like? What is the speed of radiation emitted by a black hole? Black holes are not infinitely dense, only the singularity. I suppose you could try and define a speed of sound, for a ring singularity.

I can lay out some supporting facts which could be reasons why is it so- Hindi is hardly spoken in most of these states except arunachal Pradesh and Assam. And their Hindi has an accent. Most of the script doesn't support any protagonist which look mongoloids unless Bollywood writes or director writes a story which could fit any person of India whether look mongoloids or dravidians. Bollywood is ruled by certain families and breaking that bar has been the most difficult one. On Mary kom movie, the lead role Mary kom was played by Priyanka while there are numerous trained theater artists from national reputes institute likes NSD, who could have easily and convincingly justify the acting. But, again, Bollywood doesn't open door for non Bollywood. It was great opportunity for any north east Indians actors. Every artists want name, fame and respect for themselves.

        "a": "Do some exercise, go outside do something other than just nothing. Anything is better than nothing. Make sure you eat something however, you need a certain calorie intake in order to burn calories. You should also limit your diet. Stay away from soda, chips, and candy. Go towards things such as fruits, vegetables, and everything that has the vitamins that you need. If your 150 pounds sitting around for an hour quietly only burns you 68 calories. However if you are 180 pounds, every mile that you walk will burn 100 calories. Every calorie counts when you are trying to loose weight. Here are just a few more tips to make this more simple. Here are 10 more tips to lose weight even faster: Eat a high-protein breakfast.  Eating a  high-protein breakfast  has been shown to reduce cravings and calorie intake throughout the day ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ). Avoid sugary drinks and fruit juice.  These are the most fattening things you can put into your body, and avoiding them can help you lose weight ( 22 ,  23 ). Drink water a half hour before meals.  One study showed that drinking water a half hour before meals increased weight loss by 44% over 3 months ( 24 ). Choose weight loss-friendly foods (see list).  Certain foods are very useful for losing fat. Here is a list of  the 20 most weight loss-friendly foods on earth . Eat soluble fiber.  Studies show that soluble fibers may reduce fat, especially in  the belly area . Fiber supplements like  glucomannan  can also help ( 25 ,  26 ,  27 ). Drink coffee or tea.  If you\u2019re a  coffee  or a  tea  drinker, then drink as much as you want as the caffeine in them can  boost your metabolism  by 3-11% ( 28 ,  29 ,  30 ). Eat mostly whole, unprocessed foods.  Base most of your diet on whole foods. They are healthier, more filling and much less likely to cause overeating. Eat your food slowly.  Fast eaters gain more weight over time.  Eating slowly makes you feel more full and boosts  weight-reducing hormones  ( 31 ,  32 ,  33 ). Use smaller plates.  Studies show that people automatically eat less when they use smaller plates. Strange, but it works ( 34 ). Get a good night\u2019s sleep, every night.  Poor sleep is one of the strongest risk factors for  weight gain , so taking care of your sleep  is important  ( 35 ,  36 ). What are the best foods to eat when you want to lose weight? What are the best ways to lose weight? What are your thoughts on losing weight? How have you successfully lost a large amount of weight? What are the best ways to reduce and eliminate belly, abdominal, and thigh fat? You are bit overweight according to your height. Depending upon your body frame your weight should be between 48 to 58kg. You are feeling fat because you have some excess body fat which you will need to lose to feel perfect. You might have tried things which didn't work or due to lack of knowledge you were not able to lose weight. There's nothing to worry about, below I'll list few things which will help you to lose weight. Science of weight loss: In order to start losing weight you will need to eat less calories than your body needs, meaning you will need to create a caloric deficit by eating less than what you are eating currently. You can increase the deficit by doing any kind of physical activity, consider walking when possible or taking stairs. Bigger the caloric deficit more you lose. That's the basic science. You don't need to starve yourself to lose weight , all you need to do is make smart choices while eating. Consider doing below changes to see results: Eat more veggies it'll keep you full for longer and veggies are less in calories it'll help you to reduce your daily calories which is necessary for weight loss. Cut down all the sugar based food. I know maharastrian diet consists of too many sweet dishes, you will need reduce eating sweet food or avoid if possible. Sugar does not contain any useful nutrient, sugar is the main reason for fat gain. Reduce processed food, fried food and stop having cold drinks it'll will only make you fat. Increase water intake. Drink more water it is necessary for weight loss. Eat less rice, chapati/roti and eat bhakri instead. Consider eating food which are less in calories. Hope this helps.

Eat Fewer Carbs and More Lean Proteins You can lose several pounds by following a low-carb diet for just a few days. In fact, lots of research has shown a low-carb diet is a very effective way to lose weight and improve health A short-term decrease in carb intake can also reduce water weight and bloating. Consume green tea thrice a day. This is why people who go low-carb often see a difference on the scale as early as the next morning after starting the diet. Additionally, making sure you eat plenty of protein can help reduce your appetite even further while boosting your metabolism Try eliminating or drastically reducing all starchy carbs and sugars 2. Eat Whole Foods and Avoid Most Processed Junk Foods When you\u2019re trying to lose weight quickly then it can be helpful to eat a simple diet based on whole foods. These foods tend to be very filling, and make it easier to eat fewer calories without getting too hungry. During the week, you should make sure to eat mostly whole, single-ingredient foods. Avoid most foods that are highly processed. Eating mostly lean proteins and low-carb veggies can be incredibly satisfying even if you\u2019re not getting that many calories. 3. Reduce Your Calorie Intake by Following These Tips Reducing your calorie intake may be the most important factor when it comes to weight loss. If you aren\u2019t eating fewer calories than you expend, then you will not lose fat Here are a few simple tips to reduce calorie intake: Count calories: Weigh and log the foods you eat. Use a calorie counting tool to keep track of the amount of calories and nutrients you are taking in. Eat only at meals: Reduce all snacks and don\u2019t eat anything after dinner. Cut your condiments: Eliminate calorie-dense condiments and sauces. Fill up on veggies: Fill your plate with vegetables and limit starchy carbs and added fats for the week. Choose lean proteins: Choose lower-fat proteins, such as chicken and fish. Don\u2019t drink your calories: Instead, opt for water, zero-calorie drinks, tea or coffee. Protein shakes are fine if you count them as a meal. 4. Lift Weights and Try High-Intensity Interval Training Exercise is one of the best ways to burn fat and improve your appearance. Resistance training, such as weight lifting, can lead to a similar amount of weight loss as regular aerobic training. It also helps you add or maintain muscle mass and strength Full-body resistance training workouts are also a great method to lower your body\u2019s carb stores and water weight, which can lead to a sharp decline in weight Lifting weights can also protect your metabolism and hormone levels, which often decline during dieting High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is another very effective training method. Like weight lifting, it can quickly reduce muscle carb stores and also boost other important aspects of weight loss, such as your metabolism and fat-burning hormones You can perform HIIT three to four times a week after a workout or as part of your normal training regimen. It is very important to do this with 100% effort or intensity. Most sprints should not last more than 30 seconds. Here are a few protocols you can try. These can done running in place or outside, or applied to a cardio machine like a bike, rower or treadmill: Session 1: 10 x 20-second sprint with 40 seconds rest. Session 2: 15 x 15-second sprint with 30 seconds rest. Session 3: 7 x 30-second sprint with 60 seconds rest. Session 4: 20 x 10-second sprint with 20 seconds rest. 5. Be Active Outside of the Gym In order to burn extra calories and lose more weight, you can also increase your daily activity. In fact, how active you are throughout the day when you aren\u2019t exercising also plays a very important role in weight loss and obesity Simple lifestyle changes such as walking or biking to work, taking the stairs, going for walks outside, standing more or even cleaning the house can help you burn a lot of calories. 6. Intermittent Fasting Is Another Simple Way to Reduce Weight Quickly Intermittent fasting is another effective and proven tool for dropping fat It forces you to reduce your calorie intake, since you are limiting your eating to a short window of time. There are many different protocols , such as a 16-hour fast with an 8-hour feeding window, or a 20-hour fast with a 4-hour feeding window. If you\u2019re combining fasting with exercise, it may be wise to do the fasting at a different time than your workout. 7. Use These Tips to Reduce Water Retention Several other methods can help you drop water weight and appear leaner and lighter. These include: Take dandelion extract: A supplement called dandelion extract can help reduce water retention. Drink coffee: Coffee is a healthy source of caffeine. Studies suggest that caffeine can help you burn more fat and lose excess water Mind your intolerances: Eating things that you are intolerant to, such as gluten or lactose , can lead to excessive water retention and bloating. Avoid foods that you think you may be intolerant to. Good luck!! If you like it please do upvote and follow me.

        "a": "I love games, technical arts, computer science and technology. Being a game developer is one of the ways that I can still have creative freedom and combine all of the above fields of interest. Plus I can work on my own game / creations and spread the joy. I grew up playing this (Need for Speed 2 SE): All the way till this (Need for speed Most wanted): In 2011, what I thought was my 1st random job, turned out to be an opportunity to meet the people who made the games above: The Audio director (left) and lead 3D Vehicle modeler (middle) who made the cars\u2019 in the above games. I\u2019m on the right. (United Front Games studio in Vancouver, BC). They left Electronic Arts - Black Box, the team which made all the Need for speed titles to make their own studio called United Front games. I didn\u2019t know this when I got the job there but once I was introduced to the team I was ecstatic!. I was a kid when these people were creating games for me to play (Fan level > 9000). This was a very happy moment,  I also told them that people in India still play the games they made in cafe\u2019s and colleges,  after being pirated , long after the creaters have forgotten them.  They were quite happy knowing that the games they made are still loved in markets they don\u2019t know much about. Older games took more blood and sweat to create as the technology had not matured as it is today. Edit: In 2012, I met the Animation supervisor of Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) / Pixar, Han Hickel (light blue jeans in the image below) : Star Wars 1/2, Jurassic Park and Toy Story were part of his works. Hal Hickel - Wikipedia Back to the questions, I forgot about the comparison to making web apps, yes I do make web apps now as well as use game engines (Unity). But both in 3d, I do not make business software for banks or companies if that\u2019s what you were comparing with. The career choice was relevant to making something fun/visual/creative using technology, if I loved software architecture relevant to pure software engineering fields I would not have met above   talented people at all. Side Story, when I graduated in 2011 (Masters), I didnt know I was going to get into Games at that time, I was gearing up for working with Pixar studios in Vancouver. I was called by Sony Imageworks from US on the day I graduated for their apprenticeship program for technical graduates who are visual (they are called Technical Directors in the movie industry). They called me in the morning around 11am and told me if I could join them, I was like HELL YES! It was a LucasArts project (Star Wars animated series). The same day around 4pm I was called to confirm my citizenship. I said \u201cIndian\u201d as thats who I was, they said \u201cSorry at the moment we cannot take you in\u201d, the reason being the offer was open to US / Canadian residents only. I had the offer given and taken away from me in 3 hours not because of my skill but my citizenship/country. It took some time for me to realise that my country/citizenship would hamper me from getting closer to my dreams. I was very angry / annoyed with life and for some months I had no real job offers. After which I got one at United Front games. Also, coming from India , the picture below was my fate as a software engineer (being in a Multinational Body-shop like Infosys etc.), to be fair, I would not consider that be the environment one can excel at if they know their potential. I could not waste my creative juice in a cubicle 9\u20135 for the rest of my life: I gave the highest priority to my passion regardless of  how hard it might  have been to get to what I really wanted to do, and it paid off. Why can't programmers program? How do you get a job as a programmer if you didn't go to college for it? What is it like to be a video game programmer? Am I not fit to be a programmer if I can't program a game? Why don't more programmers use Haskell? I love game design. It revs me up. I love coming up with ideas, fleshing them out, and bringing it to life. I love studying game design. But I didn't choose to be a professional game developer. You understanding is that it doesn't pay well, has poor job security, and an awful work life balance. An dost of the time you aren't vendors working on your own game. But someone else's idea. I instead pursued other avenues of programming that I found interesting (AI related stuff) that made for a better career, and kept the game design as my hobby. It has worked out better that way. To horribly misquote Tupac, \u201cI didn't choose the game programmer life, the game programmer life chose me.\" I graduated in \u201909 and it took me a year and a half to find work. I had applied to numerous jobs, had several interviews and still nothing. I had put my resume online and was contacted by a company that makes serious games, which I had never even heard of. They hired me and I have been making games ever since. Because I enjoy making them. I enjoy prototyping new features. I enjoy the challenges that come with the job. And I enjoy seeing my name at the credits after a particularly tough project. Feels good to have seen a project from beginning to end.",

If parents are alive probably you need their presence to call it an arranged marriage. If they are not capable of leading the search then you can do it through your elders at home. Arranged marriages means arranged by your family /friends and well wishers. It is possible through marriage brokers or temple priests also. The last reserve could be matrimonial sites and marriage brokers. Unfortunately in urban societies families are shrinking and children have been left with parents only for help. That is one reason why and how love marriages ,face book connections,and other commercial medias connecting people are taking place quite easily though it ends up sometimes  badly.it  is always good to have parents to help.

Yes, many MIT males that I knew from the 70\u2032s dated female students from BU and some married. But much of that was two-fold: MIT had a lot of fraternities across the Charles River in Boston that were close to BU and a \u201cparty is a Party\u201d. And, the large Jewish community at BU would host mixers and many of the Jewish students from MIT would attend and the MIT males would meet the BU females. The BU males always thought they were bigger and tougher than the MIT students so the only place they wanted to meet MIT students was playing an intercollegiate sport. However, we did win a fair fraction of those contests\u2026.. And to answer another question: No, people do not attend Harvard or MIT to meet students from MIT or Harvard (opposite).",

After interviewing hundreds of candidates over the years I\u2019ve learned that the best interviews are those where it is an easy conversation rather than an awkward dialog. If the interviewee is nervous or boring this will have a negative effect on the interviewer as they will have to work harder on getting answers out of the interviewee. Interviewers are usually thinking about several other things in their work and personal life during the interview and the last thing they want to do is sit in an interview for an hour with someone that can\u2019t hold a conversation.

NCERT is mother of all the social science subject. It is recommended to read NCERT to have a basic idea of arts subject which one would be encountering in law school, especially for those coming from science background. Because once your arts subject commence in 1st year, there will be a presumption that you have read NCERT and have a basic idea about the discussion going on in class. This helps the faculty to shift the discussion to a higher pedestral. As far as your question is concerned, not everything will be there in NCERT but whatever you will be taught in 1st year, you can always relate it to your basic knowledge gained by NCERT.

There are multiple books on these subjects which you can use as reference which are available in almost all law school libraries . So there won't be any scarcity of the same.

It\u2019s been an awesome ride so far, not always easy, but thank you for being with me in those times that I was going uphill. Thank for for placing all those awesome opportunities, so I could become all I was ment to be in your eyes, which by the way is above and beyond my wildest dreams. Thank you for all the fantastic people you placed on my path, some as gentle as silk, some rough like sandpaper, but they all shaped me into who I am today. Thank you also for sunrises, sunsets, flowers, mountains, music, and all the other things that make life super fun. Thank you, God! What is a romantic thing to say to my boyfriend in order to prove to him that I love him? If you die and go straight to hell, what would you say to Satan? What are some things NOT to say to a gamer? What's the best thing to say after someone rejects you? People say who created a Creator? Even if some Creator who created us was made by another Creator, does that make him any less creator of us? I strongly doubt that if a creator deity truly existed in the literal sense, that said deity would identify with the human concept of gender at all - that seems egotistical and anthropocentric to assume. That said deity would, on top of that, identify as male seems improbable - but if I learned that said Creator went by \u201cHe/Him\u201d, I might think to myself \u201coh, that explains some things; guess He\u2019s still learning\u201d. Assuming, though, that I am to take the premise of this question as written: The first thing I\u2019d ask is why. Why exactly do we exist in the manner we do? If we were created this way, and did not merely arrive this way by chance, there are a lot of painful contradictions in the nature of our existence that strain the assumption that this Creator was wholly benevolent. Maybe He wasn\u2019t. Then, I\u2019d feel compelled to ask: are we a simulation? I mean, I\u2019d have to assume in this instance that we would be. Are there, then, other simulations like ours? To what effect? To deal with boredom, like a game; to solve a problem; or even to make a particular point? Are there other civilizations inside our own simulation? How much does the level of detail drop off when considering places other than Earth? Is it even, maybe, the case that one particular person is the only one being simulated in high fidelity? If so, why? I\u2019d probably then ask why said Creator came back now. What exactly changed that made this entity decide to start intervening in our affairs again? For the rest of the world, what does His reappearance mean for the trajectory of events? If we\u2019re in a simulation, does this mean the simulation is about to halt, and that we\u2019ve entered the data-tabulation phase or something like that? Are the rules about to change drastically? What about those of us who would have rather had things progress as they were going to, without said intervention? I\u2019d probably reiterate \u201cwhy?\u201d a few times. There are so many things in this world that are just\u2026 unnecessary, horrifying, heart-wrenching, etc. Murder, sexual abuse, slavery, torture - I could go on. Death itself, even. Is it necessary to have subjected many of us to so much pain? What justifies that? Does anything? After all of that, I guess I\u2019d have no choice but to thank this entity for my existence, however brief and limited in scope, and ask that maybe He consider making a backup copy of everyone who was worth it and forward them on to some other purpose. Maybe that\u2019s what the afterlife is for. I\u2019d probably also comment on how worthy (or not) I found this entity\u2019s motives, and express that I hoped that this was all worth it. First off, you say that \u201cit\u201d is just the \u201cCreator\u201d, nowhere that \u201cit\u201d continued to monitor us, be there for us, etc etc\u2026. We (humans beforehand, though maybe everything) could just be some alien kid\u2019s science experiment. To us, it is years and years and years\u2026. to them, it\u2019s been maybe a few days or something small like that. So whatever, this \u201cCreator\u201d appears before my like David Copperfield. And I imagine myself there\u2026 all peaceful reading some interesting Quora topic, and then poof!\u2026 scaring the crap out of me! (and we will assume this \u201cCreator\u201d came in a normal non-freaky-looking human form, dressed of course) I run to the kitchen to grab the biggest knife I can find\u2026. screw it, I grab 2 knives and don\u2019t even bother to check to see if they are clean or not. Now here the dilemma\u2026.. does the \u201cCreator\u201d do anything? say anything (hopefully in English or Spanish)? do the Happy dance? pees on the floor? I mean\u2026 you say that this \u201cCreator\u201d appeared\u2026.. do YOU know what \u201cit\u201d looked like?? Do YOU know when \u201cit\u201d was to arrive?? And most of all, why the hell would he visit ME?!? Do I have ketchup on my mouth and he has come to clean it for me? Has he come to kill me and eat me after making a nice beef stew (using one of those previously grabbed knives, of course)? All these topics are goofy. How do expect ANY person on this planet to react? Is this \u201cperson\u201d supposed to have a name tag on his chest like all those people at some random large conference meetings? Does \u201cit\u201d say, \u201cHey -you-, I\u2019m the Creator!\u201d (and special sound effects go off in the background coming from who knows where\u2026) So many people just want to live a fantasy. Hoping for something, someone, \u2026 anything\u2026 to come someday and whoosh!\u2026 save their lives, save humanity, save the world, and Free Willy! (finally someone does it right\u2026). Always expecting someone \u201celse\u201d to do what humans should be doing already for themselves. When there is a problem, we point at someone else. When there is something to be fixed, we point at someone else. When your life is screwed, we point at something/someone else. Get a job, have a family, and try to do a part in saving the world. YOU do it, don\u2019t point at others. Psalm 51 \u201cHave mercy upon me, O God, According to Your lovingkindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions, And my sin is always before me. Against You, You only, have I sinned, And done this evil in Your sight\u2014 That You may be found just when You speak, And blameless when You judge. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, And in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Make me hear joy and gladness, That the bones You have broken may rejoice. Hide Your face from my sins, And blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me away from Your presence, And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, And uphold me by Your generous Spirit. Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, And sinners shall be converted to You. Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God,\u201d Dave Go away. You\u2019re massively immoral, and I want nothing to do with you.",

        "a": "Sleepovers, rather than being phased out completely, generally just  change  a little bit as a person ages. At 9 years old , I\u2019d have a sleepover for a birthday party. At 13 years old , I\u2019d have a sleepover so that I could stay up late with a friend watching movies and eating way too many sweets. At 18 years old , I\u2019d have a sleepover for convenience. So, if I went to visit a friend who lived a while away, or if we\u2019d planned to spend two days together anyway (i.e. over a weekend) and we may as well just sleep over at the other\u2019s house. Maybe we\u2019re going somewhere early the next morning (the airport, or some trip), and it\u2019s just going to be easier for us both to be more organised if we set off from the same spot. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re having a house party, and we\u2019d rather just drunkenly crash right where we are at 3am, rather than navigate public transport home at midnight (my 24 year old brother did this recently!). My point is this: I wouldn\u2019t, at the age of 23 as I am now, have a birthday sleepover of eating pizza and having manicures. I probably wouldn\u2019t have a sleepover staying up late watching movies and such as I used to when I was 13 either, unless again it\u2019s a friend who lives a while away whom I don\u2019t get to see often. This all shows how sleepovers have changed, with age; it\u2019s not a \u2018sleepover\u2019, necessarily. It\u2019s sleeping over. Perfectly fine at any age. Why are teens over 16 (mainly boys) ok with online pics? My 17-year-old son wants to have a sleepover with his girlfriend. Is this normal, and what should I do? Is the movie G.B.F. ok for teens to watch? Is it ok to date 19 years old girl? I'm 24. I'm 16. Am I in my early teens, mid-teens, or late teens? Well I think first of all you are old enough to decide yourself, and your parents should respect that. They should be glad you are not getting drunk at some dubios place like other people your age do. That being said, you can have sleepovers at any age. I think its not too unusual to stay with a friend e.g. after a party when it\u2019s to late.  And a \u2018regular\u2019 sleepover? Why not? I don\u2019t see any point why one should be too old for that. I would understand if people said it was a \u201cgirls thing\u201d, but even then, don\u2019t let others influence you and do what YOU want! I am almost sixteen and my best friend is a year younger than me. We both recently moved, but before that, we were so close that we would sleep over usually at least once a week. During the summer we slept over every day (we were both moving soon and wanted to make the most of our time). I don\u2019t think there is any age where you are too old. My brother is three years older than me and he has either large groups of friends sleep over or just one person sleep over frequently, no big deal. We used to go out on weekends a lot and play ultimate frisbee and eat out and just crash at someone\u2019s house. My best friend and I would mainly actually sleep outside (hammocks or a tent depending on the mood) but we would also sleep inside and just play games, pull an all nighter, or talk. It\u2019s a great way to get closer together. This year, I\u2019ve already had a few sleepovers, a few group ones and a few just me and one other person. Sometimes sleepovers are better simply for convenience, you wouldn\u2019t have to drive all the way back home or anything. In my opinion, there isn\u2019t an age limit on sleepovers and you should enjoy doing what you want to do. If your parents trust you to make the right decisions, then they should let you, age is irrelevant. You\u2019re not too old for a sleepover, you\u2019re only 17. Teenagers have sleepovers all the time and it\u2019s a shame for people to take something you like out of your life. Maturity is a made-up concept that means different things to everyone, so I think that your parents might be worried about something else and not that you\u2019re too old. Try talking to them. Yeah, that\u2019s a little off. I would not.",

Hayes ending the Reconstruction then Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s splitting from the GOP, then the GOP becoming more conservative, then Nixon\u2019s \u201csouthern strategy\u201d and the current embrace of racists by the Republican party. Race Relations: Could the GOP use the Trayvon Martin murder as an incentive to African-American Democrats to switch parties? Can you be a supporter for both the GOP and Democrats? Are we witnessing the end of the Republican party? Abraham Lincoln was an anti-slavery Republican, opposed at the time by the Democratic Party. Why do most African-Americans now favor Democrats... Are Democrats \"happy\" about the destruction of the GOP by Donald Trump? That is pretty much a  non-sequitur , it makes the connection between the policies of a political party 150 years ago, and the policies of the political party now. If you voted for a political party based on their actions 10 years ago, that might make some sense. What about their actions during the Vietnam war? Making less sense now. OK, how about the Second World War? The  First  World War? How about before that, how about  decades  before that? The only thing political parties now have in common with the parties of 150 years ago is their name. There are no policies in common, no politicians in common,  nothing . It\u2019s basically like asking why people vote for a political party whose colour is blue not red, because red berries can be poisonous. It\u2019s beyond ludicrous to vote (or not vote) for a party because a party with the same name did things 150 years ago. Because of the Republicans\u2019 deliberate courting of the white racist vote as part of Nixon\u2019s Southern Strategy. See  Southern strategy  and  How the GOP became the \u201cWhite Man\u2019s Party\u201d. If you go shopping and have the choice between two products which of the following do you chose? Manufacturer A whose product was your great grandparents favorite choice 100+ years ago, but now totally sucks. Manufacturer B who may have had a crappy product back then, but now has a great one. Politics is mainly about the future, bad enough politicians must unavoidably be elected on the base of information about the present, but choosing based on long gone past would be eminently stupid! For most of the 19th Century the Democratic Party was the party of \u201cstates' rights\u201d, agrarian interests, and supporting the traditions and values of the local majority at the expense of the rule of law or protection for minorities. Is that how you would characterize today's Democratic Party? Parties shift their majority positions over time. If you've lived long enough to see the rise of Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, or Donald Trump you should already understand this to some extent. Now meditate on what happens when you add up 5 - 10 of these shifts successively, and you get at least a first approximation of how history works.",

What is the saddest thing you've ever seen? What was the happiest moment in your life? What is the saddest thing someone ever said to you? What is the saddest thing you have ever seen on the internet? The saddest goodbye moment that I experienced was with my dog. I studied in Bangalore and visited home in semester breaks. In January 2012, when i was leaving home for Bangalore I wished everyone good bye but could not find my dog. Whenever I pack my bags the night before he understands that I will leave him and go back again. I searched the entire house and found him under a bed in one of the rooms. I called him many times but he did not come out. I almost crawled on the ground and went to the other corner under the bed where he was. He did not even turn his head towards me. This broke my heart. I said him I am leaving and came out . Cried my heart out before getting into the car to go to the airport. I guess he knew he had less time. He passed away on May 2nd 2012 and I never saw him again. Maybe I got a feeling too that I will not see him again so I was so heart broken that he did not talk to me ( i always talk to him) when I was leaving. I miss him every second and wish I never studied outside . The next break I did not want to go home. I knew no one would be waiting for me at the gate. The saddest goodbye I ever experienced was with my dad. I started sobbing just typing that much. He didn't die or injured or sick. But when I was 6 and we still lived in our big house in Missouri just before bed time he called me into the kitchen and sat me down on his lap. \"Vivian(fake name) I'm going to tell you something you can't tell anyone else. Very soon I'm going back to Ethiopia to visit my brothers, okay. And I might be gone for a long time. But don't worry I'll come back. And remember don't tell anyone except for your sisters.\",\"What about mommy?\",\"It's okay I already told her.\". 7 years later I still remember the exact conversation. But that wasn't the worst goodbye. A month or so later he returned with gifts from all our relatives(we have A Lot). And I was in kindergarten then so I didn't notice the change of atmosphere between my parents.  A year or just under a year later he leaves again, this time for good. He planned for us to come with him and move halfway across the world to Africa to be with his and hers family(they both are from Ethiopia \\U0001f1ea\\U0001f1f9). But although it is not all rural farms, their president has been leading for 20+ years, and it was a mess. Plus the schools weren't great(I went once and visited my cousin's school and the teacher had a belt for older students and a stick for the young ones as punishment). Growing up there she knew all of this, and she wanted more for her girls. So she decided to stay, my father being the stubborn man he is refused my moms pleas for him to stay and went on his own. My mom working as a nurse at the time couldn't afford to pay off the house, feed her 3 growing girls, and her mother, with her one pay check, and still go to all our field trips. So we sold the house and moved in with her in laws. As you can imagine it was very tense between them. But again being as young as I was hadn't noticed. Oh I loved it at my grandparents house. Especially my grandmother. She would tell us stories of her childhood and ones she would make up, she could make a game out of anything. Once she took me to her gym to ge swimming just the two of us. And I wanted to go in the hot tub with her because I didn't want to play by myself. And one of the people inside told me that I was to young but my grandmother gave him one look, and he never bothered us again. But like all good things it didn't last. My mom and grandma had a really big argument. We found an apartment and moved as soon as possible. All the while my father would come visit us every thanksgiving through about Valentine's Day(this was 2years). I remember making him a bunch of cards and a welcome home sign. And one of the best feelings was when he walked through the door running into his arms and just being completely enveloped. Because he is a tall guy and my mom is pretty petite so I never really got that kind of hug. And I just remember burrying my head into his stomach and breathing in his cologne. \u00a0By the time I was in third grade we had moved into our new two bedroom apartment with 5 girls. My two sisters and mom slept in her queen bed and her mom and I share a bunk bed. With her having polio she stays in the bottom bunk woth my stuff animals and I on top. He came for thanksgiving once in our new apartment. In the moths before his visit our phone calls have been less and less frequent and we all grew apart. But when he came that year I foolishly thought he wouldn't leave again. I thought that all those wishes I'd made on birthday cakes and dandelions had worked. That we would move back into our big house and I would get to be with my old best friend and things would work out. But I was wrong.  That February we went to the daddy daughter dance at the community center. I can honestly say it was one of the best night of my life. My straightened my Afro and I wore that new I dress I bought for the occasion. Our picture was even published the the local newspaper. About 2 weeks later he was leaving again, for good this time. But before he left he gave me his iPone as it would no longer work in Ethiopia. As a 3rd graded the phone distracted me enough that I wasn't that sad when he left. The next holiday season was my hardest goodbye. At the time I expected him to come back like he always had. But as the day passed and thanksgiving got closer, my hope got stronger. I kept hoping he would maraculously arrive. But I knew when my mom called my for dinner that was not going to happpen. This was my hardest goodbye. I was finally saying goodbye to the dream that my father would comeback forever. My mom bless her heart she works so hard to make it up for us. She holds two jobs and never has a day of. I can only wish to have the patience and virtue she has. But I still cry whenever I think of this. Whenever I think of this I remember these lyrics from Hamilton-\"But the sun comes up, and the world still spins\"",

        "a": "A unit vector simply denotes the direction. If we have a vector 4i + 3j. I will use a 2D vector because it is easier to understand. The magnitude of this vector is 5 units. The unit vector will be 0.8i + 0.6j. When you plot this unit vector on a graph paper. Along x axis, go 0.8 units. From this point, go up 0.6 units parallel to the y axis. The resultant will be 1 (the hypotenuse length). If the value 5 is multiplies with this unit vector, it simply means that you produce the same effect of the vector 4i + 3j. with the vector 5 times 0.8i + 0.6j. Where do I use unit vectors? What is the point of using unit vectors? How do I form a unit vector? Why is a unit vector used? What is a unit vector? What are the advantages of it? How do I use it in making games? What would an example be? A  unit vector  is any  vector  (pointing in any direction) with a magnitude (length) of one. You use  unit vectors  to  compute the angle between vectors  ( [math]\\alpha[/math]  in the diagram below). To compute the  angle between vectors: Compute the  unit vector  for each vector Compute  dot product  of the  unit vectors Compute the arcosine of the  dot product  and you have the  angle between the original vectors . Or, use the  Angle between Vectors  function in the  Vector Calc  at  vCalc  to do it all in one step. A unit vector is any vector that has a magnitude of one and could be pointing in any direction. Such vectors are usually used to specify directions and therefore they do not have any dimension or unit like other vectors (e.g. m/s for velocity or m/s (sq) for acceleration) The unit vectors in the positive direction of x, y and z axis are labelled as i,j and k respectively with a small hat on top. They are used to express other vectors by combining the magnitudes of those vectors with i,j and k. Example a vector V having magnitude \u201ca\u201d in x direction and magnitude \u201cb\u201d in y direction can be written as V = ai + bj (V needs to have an arrow on top while i and j should have cap as per the proper notation) You may wish to understand unit vectors better on this link on The Science Cube  [1] Footnotes [1]  Vectors: What are Unit Vectors?

If a given vector already has unit length, then it is its own unit vector; otherwise, one way of expressing any vector is as its length (\"magnitude\"), which is a scalar, times a unit vector having the same direction as the given vector: in essence, the unit vector  is  the direction of the given vector (and therein lies its primary use: as the basis for expressing  any  vector having the same direction but arbitrary length).\u00a0  As far as finding an expression for a given vector's unit vector, the most straightforward way, if the vector is given in Cartesian coordinates, is simply to calculate the length of the vector using the Pythagorean Theorem and then divide the vector by its length--it is not difficult to show that the resulting vector always has length one.\u00a0 (The one exception is the zero vector, which has no length and undefined (or no) direction: it can always be expressed as the scalar 0 times  any  unit vector--or any vector at all, for that matter.)",

This fact is even more important for IAS aspirants, who are preparing for one of the toughest entrance examinations of the country. With an ever growing and extensive syllabus to cover, managing time in an effective manner becomes a key factor for cracking the IAS examination. Despite devoting 10-12 hours for IAS studies, candidates often fail to reach their daily goals and suffer from stress, anxiety and depression, which in turn hinder the overall preparation process. Go through previous prelims papers and just try to find the way questions was asked,Go through syallbus of mains every day just look at that. 1.Start with NCERT books(Basic) I mean pick one Subject and buy all the years subject books of that subject from 6\u201312th standard-try to finish one book in one week with basic understanding of what you are reading.You can find questions based only on NCERT books so after reading a book do these questions 2.Then advance level; Buy a most reputable standard book for that subject and read that in 20 days(that's based on your capacity) MUST READ BOOKS 1)  Introduction to the Constitution of India 20 Edition 2)  India Since Independence - Bipan Chandra 3)  India's Struggle For Independence \u2013 Bipan Chandra 4)  Indian Economy : For Civil Services Examinations 6th Edition (2014) - Ramesh Singh 5)  Indian Polity for Civil Services Examinations 4th Edition - Laxmikanth 6) Geography of India- Majid Hussain - 5th Edition 7)  Ethics In Governance 8) India After Gandhi: The History Of The World's Largest Democracy 9)  Mastering Modern World History -5th Edition, Norman Lowe 10)  Select Constitutions: 16th Edition - S Chand 11) Environment by Shankar IAS 12)  Certificate Physical and Human Geography - Goh Cheng Leong 13)  India\u2019s National Security \u2013 A Reader 14)  Indian Social System - Ram Ahuja Now test your self by doing McQ's on that subject-don\u2019t get panicked after getting very less score coz that's just the beginningNow evaluate what happened wrong I mean in which topics you are lagging then go through that again .Follow this process with all the subjects (at any time if didn't like this then leave this method  you always have a choice ) This is subject wise approach   and general approach is also the same. The most important thing is make a habit of  reading newspaper  (you have to master the newspaper to complete in an hour). Takes notes of important articles. Read monthly magazines for current affairs of vision IAS and so test series of vision IAS and insights on India Try to write essays on some topics (practice For answer writing-if you start writing from now it'll be very helpful in mains If you know any Seniors show those answers to them Qualities to be produced to get the job. 1) Study hard 2) Effective writing style 3) To the Point Approach 4) Good English approach 5) Up to date to current affairs 6) Quality material and guidance 7) Patience and Self-confidence Last but not least answer for your question is yes it is possible! Many of aspirants known to me cracked on 8 months! So we also can. Finally all the best-you have enough time please utilize that. If you want to go through perfect sample time table check this: Praveen Kante's answer to What should be the time table for an IAS aspirant and study schedule for him/her? I am 18 years old. I wish to crack IAS exam. What should be my strategy? How should I start? I am studying 2nd year mechanical engineering and I want to crack IAS exam. How should I prepare? How do we plan to study for CFA level 1 in 4 months? Is coaching a must to crack the IAS exam? How do I crack IAS exam in my first attempt as I am in 2nd year BTech(ME)? Yes you can crack this exam with 1 year of preparation. Strategy to clear this exam is very simple , all you need is a desire to get into civil services with good preparation material. Let\u2019s talk about the strategy now. Download UPSC civil services syllabus and previous year question papers . Analyse those papers to have an idea of what type of questions are being asked in this exam. Eg: In geography you will find most of the questions are from climate, river tributaries, ports dams, forest type and areas, maps (strait, sea, gulf countries). Similarly analyse all the subjects from previous year paper. Now you will need material to cover all the topics being asked in this exam. The Hindu  : Read this newspaper from prelims and mains point of view. 80% Current afairs question are from this newspaper only. So whatever you find important regarding prelims perspective please make a note of it for revision before exam. Devote maximum time to editorial section. But read only those editorials which connect to the  Mains  syllabus. Note down imp points from that editorial in your own language. Geography:  Class XI Ncert( 2 books ) , class XII Ncert, Mrunal youtube (Rajtanil mam geography videos), Maps ( Oxford or Orient swan + Wall maps). History: Modern India: Bipan chandra India struggle for independence or Brief History of Modern India Spectrum. Medieval India: Satish chandra ncert Ancient india: India ancient past by R.S sharma Arts and Culture: Ncert Fine arts or Nitin Singhania. (Devote less time here and more on Modern India). Polity : M. Lakshmikanth Economy: Key concepts by Shankarganesh Mrunal videos + Class XI and XII ncert. Economic survey ( when released). Indian Budget (key points only) Environment: Class XII biology ( last 4 chapters) Shanker Ias (selective chapters like on climate and organisations, protocols etc) S&T :  current affairs Vision IAS CA monthly magazine (only for revision purpose) Optionals : Choose your optional wisely and devote 2 to 3 hours on it daily if you are new to it. Websites:  Government websites(environment, health related), Downtoearth, insightonindia (secure mains answer writing), investopedia (economy related issue), Few months before exam, join a good test series or you can buy it from market and solve it at your home. Sample Timetable: Hope, I was able to answer your query. Yes It is possible. First let me tell you that you will get many answer for this question. My answer is that if you are serious then buy the below books and start reading.

        "a": "So I\u2019m guessing the V is an absolute value function. But more over, I would examine the two lines of the V separately. Observe that on the right side of the V, you get the function y= 2x-2, just from (0,-2), and (1,0). You can find the slope, and you know the y intercept. Now in order to find the intersection of 2x-2 with kx^2, set the two equations equal to one another kx^2= 2x-2 kx^2\u20132x+2=0; use the quadratic formula, and notice that 4\u20134(k)(2) = 0 [under the square root part of the quadratic formula], then you know k= 0.5, So I think the answer is y= 0.5x^2 Can you help me solve this JEE Parabola question? How do you solve this math problem and what area of mathematics will help me prepare for similar problems? What is the difference between how math majors solve math problems and how science majors solve math problems? Can someone help me solve this tricky trig problem involving bearings? Can somebody help me with this math problem?  Slope of line on right is 2. Both the parabola and the line on the right intersect at point (a,b). Two equations can be written: b = 2a-2 (from y=2x-2) b=ka^2 (from y=kx^2) or ka^2 =2a-2 using the equation for the parabola y=kx^2 we get dy/dx=2kx. By definition this is the slope of the line tangent to the parabola at point x. Since the tangent line to the parabola at point (a,b) has a slope of 2 we write 2=2ka, hence k=1/a Substituting into ka^2 =2a-2 we get (1/a)a^2 = 2a-2. Solving for a we get a=2 Using k=1/a we get k=1/2 Using b=ka^2 we get b=2 So: The equation of the parabola is y=0.5x^2 The lines intersect the parabola at (2,2) on the right and (-2,2) on the left (since they\u2019re symmetric).",

        "a": "I think it most certainly is a programmer preference, but this is my own rule of thumb: Class : Basically use them for just about everything. If you\u2019ve got anything more than a primitive value, and leave it with me, chances are I\u2019ll wrap it up in a class. Plain Subclass : Don\u2019t do it all that often these days, with extension methods available in many languages I used like C#, and also the availability of abstract classes, I just don\u2019t find myself doing it much. Abstract class : I use these for when it obvious that more than one class should share a common base. A quick example would be when I create settings/preferences in my apps. Whatever the settings/preferences, they all need to be able to save to disk, load from disk, check a preference exists, supply a default value if it doesn\u2019t etc. So it doesn\u2019t matter if the settings are for a printer, or for a game, all that stuff is the same, the only thing that changes are the settings themselves, like \u201cprint in black and white\u201d or \u201cenemies spawn randomly\u201d or whatever. For me, that\u2019s an ideal place for an abstract class. Interfaces : I use interfaces for when things need to behave the same, but work very differently. Most recently, I wrote an SFTP/Amazon S3 client for Windows (should be on the Store soon), and while I need to present SFTP and S3 as being just about the same, i.e. I need to connect, list directories, download/upload files etc. behind the scenes they work in an entirely different way, and subclassing makes no sense. For that, I make an interface for \u201cIRemoteFileSystem\u201d or whatever, and have SFTPRemoteFileSystem and S3RemoteFileSystem implement the interface. Basically I used interfaces for stuff which needs to present the same features, but behind the scenes work entirely differently. In Java, when should you use an interface instead of an abstract class? Is it correct to say that an interface is an abstract class? How do I make a interface in Java that I can use in multiple classes? Can I use a non-abstract method in an abstract class? Can I make an object of class A in class B provided B isn't a subclass of class A? This used to be my favorite question which I used to ask candidate in an interview. Most people only talk about the syntactical difference between abstract class and interface, which is not quite enough. I can replace interface with an abstract class and make it work unless that interface is being implemented by a class which extends already an another class. I use below rule If the object that I am trying to implement in a class has certain traits which are shared across different family of unrelated object then I abstract those traits and put into an interface for e.g Object Tire has nothing to do with Object Ball except that they both can bounce. So I would create an Bounceable interface, Tire and Ball classes will implement Bounceable interface. 2) If the object that I ma trying to implement in a class has certain traits which are shared across same family of related object then I would use an abstract class .The abstract class can also be used to hold common functionality in base abstract class and lend the abstract implement to the subclasses Classic example Class Shape, Class Circle extend Shape , Class Rectangle extends Shape Shape here can be an abstract class with abstract method area which is left for subclasses Circle and Rectangle to implement. Hope you understand now which to use in what situation. It\u2019s not really a matter of preference \u2014 these distinctions have specific uses. I\u2019ll try to explain in the most concise terms: Class = I need to create instances of this Subclass = I need to create instances that build upon what I have already, but are different in one or more specific ways Abstract = I\u2019ll never make an instance of this specifically because instances will be too different to inherit common behavior \u2014 even though the class represents a single, well-defined concept. Instances might share some common behavior, but there will be at least one member that requires implementation from scratch. (Hard to explain without an example, but consider a  System.IO .Stream in .NET. Stream is abstract because the different kinds of streams don\u2019t share common behavior \u2014 for example MemoryStream and FileStream. They both \u201cact like streams\u201d and have stream methods and properties, but they operate in completely different contexts. You cannot make a Stream instance by itself without committing to a particular kind of stream from the start, in other words.) Interface = I need to capture what\u2019s common to several classes into a single set of methods and properties called an interface \u2014 because I don\u2019t know how my needs will evolve in the future, and I don\u2019t want to be tied to a particular implementation of something. I know what my functional needs are (the interface expresses them), but the implementation may evolve over time or interact with other components I can\u2019t foresee now. Likewise, I may need to make an existing class behave like something else or conform to some other API without compromising my original intent. (Another example is helpful here \u2014 consider IDisposable in .NET. When you  implement  IDisposable on a class, you are indicating that your class uses something (memory or handles or files or whatever) that it needs to explicitly release or close when finished using them. It\u2019s entirely up to you what exactly is \u201cdisposed\u201d by your class, but by implementing that interface you are saying that your class behaves just like any other class that has similar needs \u2014 without depending on any particular implementation.) This is how i\u2019d explain this to a java programmer. A class: any obect you need to use in its current form. (Cant be abstract if you need to instantiate it) you need something with particlar functionality\u2026. Like a log message. It has a particular structure, and you can access certain members, like \u201ctext\u201d or \u201ctimestamp\u201d. An abstract class: you need something with particlar functionality\u2026. Like a log message. It has a particular structure, and you can access certain members, like \u201ctext\u201d or \u201ctimestamp\u201d, but you can't instantiate it. If you create a scheduler log message (subclass) and an error log message (subclass) your logger method can be passed the \u201clog message\u201d class and write message.GetText() to a file, without caring which subtype it is. This happens both for class, and abstract class. You'll see the difference between the two in a minute. a subclass: A scheduler log message\u2026 subclassed from either of the above log messages. In either case, you can check to see if it is an instance of a scheduler log message ( which would either have an additional field, or different functionality ). The difference is that every log message has to be a subclass, if the log message is abstract\u2026 You would have to have an error log message, a login log message, etc. you couldn't just create a log message if you had an error, or wanted to log the method of login, without also creating that subclass type of login log message. If you create log message as a class, rather than an abstract class, you don't have to sub class every kind of log message. It ONLY makes sense to have log message abstract if every single subclass has unique information. Scheduling log message might have a particular structure in the text, and you need to look for \u201cstart time\u201d to parse that into an \u201cappointment event\u201d obect. (I know this is a hideous example, but i havent had my coffee yet\u2026 dont ever program something like i just described) an interface, as stated in the other answer, is for when you need similar behavior in unrelated objects. Humans and fish can both \u201cswim\u201d. When you implement swim in a human, you might have something like kick feet, and rotate arms. In a fish, the implementation might say Move tailfin.",

        "a": "A  central defender  to partner  Bailly  is the first signing Jose will be trying to make. You can see by the tactics used by him that he doesn\u2019t trust his defenders in the big games. I feel Jose might opt for  Varane  since they have already worked together in Madrid.  And I bet that either  Phil Jones  or  Chris Smalling  will be sold in the summer If  Luke Shaw  somehow doesn\u2019t impress Jose in the pre-season, Jose will try to sign a  LB . Central Midfield:  This is the most important position which Jose needs to concentrate on.  Carrick  is getting older by the day and Manchester United desperately need to replace him. The holding midfielder role is the most important one and we all saw what  N\u2019Golo Kante  did at  Leicester  and  Chelsea . My bet on the CM is  Verratti/Draxler. Striker : What would have been  Man United\u2019s  position in  EPL  will they hadn\u2019t missed those chances in all those drawn matches at home?!! With  Zlatan  out with a knee injury and  Rashford  still not up to the mark, Manchester United need a top quality striker. Jose will be looking at  Antoine Griezmann , a well proven striker with  25 goals  in the last  three seasons of La Liga I hate to say this, but it looks like  David De Gea  is on his way to  Real . Jose might give  Sergio Romero  a chance seeing his performance last night instead of signing a new  GK . And the young  Periera  should be a good back to him. In\u2019s: Varane/Michael Keane, Verratti/Draxler, Antoine Griezmann. Out\u2019s: Jones, Young, Fellaini, Rooney. Starting eleven: GK: Romero(Pereira) Defenders: Valencia(Darmian), Bailly, Varane(Jones/Rojo), Shaw(Blind/Darmian) Midfield: Herrera, Verratti/Draxler(Carrick), Pogba Forwards: Mkhi(Mata), Griezmann(Rashford), Martial(Rashford) Who do you think Manchester United will sign next season? Did Manchester United sign any players in 2014? If so, who was signed? Who should Manchester United sign in the summer 2017? I have been seeing reports that Manchester United is going to sign Gareth Bale next summer. Is this true? Do you think that Pogba will be at United next season? Manchester United had the best squad in the Premier League 2016\u201317. STRIKER:   Zlatan Ibrahimovic  probably will leave this summer for MLS. We need a replacement for him. Manchester United should buy a striker possessing aerial threat, pace and quality finishing. Robert Lewandowski Alvaro Morata Griezmann is one of the favourites to join Manchester United but he is not a pure striker. We also have  Marcus Rashford , the teenage sensation who is gonna rock next season. DEFENDERS: CENTER BACK:   Eric Bailly  has proved his worth. But  Smalling, Jones and Rojo  lack quality and consistency.  Daley Blind  is never a centre back. Looks like  Smalling  will leave this summer. Bailly needs a perfect partner with whom he can play every week. Eric Dier Michael Keane Raphael Varane FULL BACKS :   Luke Shaw  has the potential to become one of world\u2019s best left backs. But his career is being by successive injuries. He possesses incredible pace and he can control the left wing single handedly like Antonio Valencia did in the right wing this season. He is my favourite full back.  Antonio Valencia  has been sensational this season. He is really a \u2018MACHINE\u2019. He runs our right wing single handedly. So no need of a replacement for Valencia. There is also  Axel Tuanzebe  who performed decently in the right back Vs Arsenal. MIDFIELD : DEFENSIVE :  We need a legendary replacement for  Michael Carrick  ( if he leaves). He is a superb professional. He is an underrated legend. His composure and leadership on the pitch played a vital role this season. Its quite tough to replace him. There arent many players like Carrick. I can find only one quality player like him but he is quite attack minded. Toni Kroos ATTACK :  It is almost conformed that  James Rodriguez  is ready to join Manchester United for 60 million. We dont actually need him right now cause we already have  Juan Mata  and  Henrikh Mhkitaryan  who can play in that position. We also have  Jesse Lingard  and  Andreas Pereira  ( on loan ) who can play in that position. But James is a quality player. His left foot is very dangerous. He has the potential to score 20+ goals a season. United need to sign 5 players to strengthen their squad ( ST, CAM who can even play on the wing , CDM , CB , LB ) \u2026.(GK incase De Gea leaves) ST  - Griezmann ( other options are Mbappe,Dybala) CAM  - Sanchez / Ozil / Reus / James Rodriquez (Realistically Willian would be a good option as united will have to break the bank for Griezmann and for the other signings ) (United have good players in this position like Mkhi , Mata , Lingard , Martial , Rooney so they dont need to spend much on this position) CDM - Verrati/Kroos (other options are Javi Martinez, Dier ) CB - Hummels/Marquinhos/Umtiti/Giminez (Subotic,Lindelof,Keane) United desperately need a CB to partner Bailly. LB - Danny Rose , Raphael Guerreiro ,David Alaba GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED The classic fan will want lots of big signings to boost this team, not realizing that the constant churn in this team is not helping our success. We need a 2 or 3 small additions, no real marquee signings to compete next season. We do not need a striker, I am perfectly happy to have Marcus Rashford leading the line every week, he has outperformed Zlatan Ibrahimovic this season and is good enough now to get 20 goals next season. Martial whilst a Left winger is an adequate backup. A Medium level goal poacher would be nice, the likes of a Sokjaer or Hernandez but not entirely necessary. The attacker we need is a Right winger, not sure who this would be but Lingard is not good enough if we want to win the league. We also need a long term replacement for Carrick who is amazing but can\u2019t go on forever. Again just a young lad here not a name. Our squad is one of the best in the league, we don\u2019t need anymore good players to be successful Manchester united have been well below average in terms of points and results. We have drawn a staggering number of draws in the league so far. We are sixth and have won lies number of PL matches in our history so far. Yet, we have played better than so far in post Sir Alex years. We have created good number of chances and yet our finishing is poor. Our conversion rate is below par with Pogba has hit woodwork more than anyone in league. Pogba created more chances than Others and yet lies below in assists. Area to improve Defense- we need a CB as smalling has regressed with Jones injury ridden. We are playing a LB at Centre back- Blind. Maybe we could buy Michael Keane to help the defense. MF- we need a midfielder to help Pogba, Herrera and Carrick. James Rodriguez will be playing in No-10 so he could be ignored. Bernando Silva from Monaco has been touted as a solution. Attack- we are good in attacking and not in finishing. Greizman could be a food solution for us.",

        "a": "If Pakistan and Bangladesh reunites with India and goes back to the original pre-partition map of India. As in Below: Using current demographics, the population of Hindus in India will be 63 percent and the population of Muslims will be 31 percent. For reunification to take part, a couple of big changes need to happen inside of Pakistan, the country and it\u2019s citizenary need to accept their history, their lineage and need to let go of the two-nation theory. The Indian Republic is not based on religion, it is a secular country and one moves forward in life based on an individual persons character and merits. This needs to be acceptable to the people of Pakistan and Bangladesh. India cannot have religion based politics but country based politics or even ethnic based politics would be acceptable. Everyone would be treated equal in such a country. Therefore neither would dominate the other. Considering the fact that Hinduism has been welcoming of other religious groups since the dawn of time, neither Muslims or Hindus will dominate each other and would live in perfect equality. But for this to happen, the people of Pakistan will have to put their country first and have the belief that religion is a private matter and there shall always be separation of mosque, temple, gurdwara, pagoda, church and state. Muslim beliefs will definitely have more influence over the Indian nation if there is a reunification. But since 1947, India and Pakistan have grown apart from each other, creating a theocratic country based on religion has made Pakistan overtly obessed with religion to the point of extremism. The Pakistanis cannot see themselves as a Muslim first, as long as that happens, then there will always be a need for Pakistan. This is not compatible with the beliefs of India or the Indian nation. Reunification will lead to more bloodshed, it will take another 100 years to undue the damage of partition and change the mindset of Pakistan to be more inclusive of all religious groups. Indians need to come out of mourning for the loss of partition of losing land that has always been a part of the Indian nation. Consider it as a big price to pay for the benefit of the people of the Indian nation. The time to stop partition was in 1947. It is too late to undue the greatest blunder on the face of the planet, as stated by Altaf Hussain, Pakistani leader of the MQM party. In 1947, Time Magazine had the best cover for the Independence of India. \u201c Liberty and Death\u201d  it was a destruction within. The India that was once Pakistan and Bangladesh has died, and all we can do is bury the past and move on. India should build a monument or museum dedicated to the partition of India, and showcase how Indian Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims and Christians died fighting for a united and secular Indian nation, where anyone regardless of their religion can one day become Prime Minister, a monument dedicated to the inhabitants of present day India and Indians. The history of India is filled with moments that have drastically changed the course of time and the way we view the world. Mughal Emperor Aurgenzeb who is considered a hero in Pakistan and a villian in India should have never been an Emperor. First in line to the throne and that too someone who believed in the India of today was Dara Shikoh (Sheikh), the first born son of Shah Jahah, he was murdered by Aurengezeb. Had Shikoh been Emperor, it is possible that the British would have never conquered India and there would never have been a Pakistan. Picture of Dara Shikoh Pakistan needs to grow without association with India, they need to tackle the vices in their own country and not compare themselves to anyone else, especially India. Peace \u270c Will India end up having a Muslim majority in the future? What will be the social, economical and political consequences if that happens? Why did a large number of Muslims decide to stay in India after partition in 1947? Who will rule India in 2080; Hindus or Muslims? Why do some Indian Muslims cheer for Pakistan in an India-Pakistan cricket match? Do Hindus in Pakistan regret not migrating to India in 1947? There will always remain more conflicts than the present situation and if Pakistan and India merge, the conflicts will increase manifolds due to already increasing Islamization pressure, which is prevailing not only in India but in the whole world. Lawlessness will further jeopardise the progress of the country. Chances are there that there will be setback to Caste Reservation policies (I am not sure, applicable on Hindus and some other sects also), which will have to be changed due to the pressure of some other interested countries. Yet another chance is that Bangladesh too will also try to enter into this new \u201cVENTURE\u201d and hopefully it will also succeed to be merged with \u201cNEW INDIA\u201d. Then, there will be more terrible situation. Country\u2019s progress will start afresh but on a very low pace. So there are more chances that Muslims will dominate in the whole arena. God knows, after some time, there will be another Partition and the outcome of such Partition will be horrible.",

English:  Oracle is a prophecy or prediction, answer to a question believed to come from Gods or a statement believed to be infallible and authoritative. Technical:  Oracle was a CIA project of early 60\u2019s that permitted the CIA to make sense of all the data that were collected. It was based on the concept of a relational database accessible via structured query language (SQL). Business:  Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology corporation, headquartered in Redwood Shores, California. The company primarily specializes in developing and marketing database software and technology, cloud engineered systems and enterprise software products\u2014particularly its own brands of database management systems. Hope by now, it\u2019s quite clear to you what Oracle is all about\u2026 Enjoy Reading!!! What is Oracle Fusion Middleware? Is Oracle 12c fast? Is Oracle buying Accenture? What is HCM Oracle? What is Oracle DBA? I am also assuming that the question is whether Oracle is Abbreviation\u2026. Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1978 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979, then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1982, to align itself more closely with its flagship product  Oracle Database.  In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation, which is generally referred as Oracle. SDL developed Oracle database / software. It is said that the name  Oracle   comes from the code name of a CIA-funded project Ellison had worked on when he was employed by Ampex. I assume you are asking if oracle is an abbreviation. No it is not. Oracle is oracle and thats it. You have nothing to extend it as it's not an abbreviation. Then what's the significance behind this name. Again nothing. It's just a word came is Larry or other founders mind and they named it. There is no abbreviation or elaborated full form for Oracle. It\u2019s NASDAQ trading name is ORCL.",

Second, many kingdoms, republics, and empires, would have still been here if Turkey hadn\u2019t conquered them. Third, there would be no Baklava, so I would cry. Why does Turkey support Islamist terrorists? Is Turkey considered to be more in Asia or in Europe? Why did Turkey create ISIS? What would happen if Russia invaded Turkey? Why did life exist? What would happen if we were never created? Are we even supposed to be here? Well, let me guess this if Turkey\u2026 Hold on, you must be clear. The naming of Turkey had been used since the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks at 1453, and it is still used until today. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk only adapted the name at 1923, but they were called so long before Ataturk\u2019s era. So I would suggest these: If the Ottoman Empire were never founded : definitely the Islamic Persia would soon emerge and start a conquest. On those days the Arab Caliphate had been seriously weakened and they only held the title, not power. Meanwhile, Persian revival would definitely lead Persia into another clashes with Europe. However, another factor must be the religious conflict. As Constantinople itself would not be conquered, there would be a clash between Orthodox Christians and Catholics. Vatican those days didn\u2019t recognize the power of Orthodox Constantinople, there would have a religious war between Catholics and Orthodox. Another factor would be there shall not have any renaissence and industrial revolution until early 19th century, which mean, the Americas might be discovered later than Columbus\u2019s era, and might be at 21th century we still have no modern computer. If Turkey were never founded : if Ataturk never appeared, Turkey would remain backward. And the Ottoman Empire would be spared like the Sykes-Picot Agreement. Following from it, Kurdistan would be created, Syria, Greece, Armenia and Georgia as an independence state would have larger territory than Turkey. On the same time, the USSR would eventually invade all Caucasus, and only a different: the Russians would grab more, even ate all Eastern Anatolia into the map of Russia. Other factor: women\u2019s rights would be severed because Ataturk embraced women\u2019s rights. No Ataturk, there would have been harder to make women important roles in society. Adding with that Turkey would be very conservative, less secular, less free. I doubt that it would make other impact: no birthday for Pakistan and Bangladesh - both would never be created. No pan-Turkic movement would succeed in Central Asia. Meanwhile Europe would have to fend off Russian communist force. The United States would play more role in Europe but Turkey would be out of their list instead for Kurdistan. I\u2019m not a theorist but I guess you know something of it. You heard it.",

        "a": "This question flabbergasted me. Taking a look at  The Pros and Cons of Off-Campus Lunch  and reading between the lines, it is certainly not illegal for high schools to allow students off their premises per se. But schools do have their own rules (as opposed to laws) that they expect to be obeyed. For example, one of the rules at my school was no smoking on school premises. Although inevitably some kids did behind the bike-sheds, apparently others would congregate just outside a certain entrance\u2026 along with teachers! That wouldn\u2019t happen nowadays in the same way, but I have seen teachers smoking (somewhat discretely, at least) during a fire drill, quite recently. Schools act  in loco parentis.  This term applies specifically to schools, although also to legal guardians of children. Is it illegal for parents to let high schoolers grab a bite to eat outside of the home? To be honest I doubt it. Can schools be held to a higher standard of discipline than when parents are unable to be at home at lunch? Yes, of course they can and will. Are lawmakers going say \u201cWe will punish with the full force of the law any school which ever allows a student off their premises for lunch\u201d? I just don\u2019t see it happening, anywhere in the world (North Korea excluded). Rules are better than laws when dealing with underaged students. For what it is worth, some shops near my house are even nearer to a school (less than a minute to walk). One is a bakery, another sells sweets. They have signs up saying \u201cno more than  x  pupils in the shop at a time\u201d, where  x  is something like 4. This is not in NYC, obviously, nor in the USA, but it isn\u2019t exactly as if the school isn\u2019t aware of these policies by the shopkeepers. In summary,  you  may run the risk of being punished by the rules your school has, but the school is at no serious risk of falling foul of the law. Middle and High School Students: What is the most underrated problem in the life of a teenager today? Can a high schooler get trouble for selling an essay? How can a high schooler make a lot of money? How can a high schooler make $500 in a week? What are cool cars high schoolers can get? Students should be allowed to go outside of school for lunch. This is important because not a lot of students actually like the lunch food that public schools supply us with. Actually 9/10 students would eat something else besides lunch food if they had a choice. It's not healthy, or sanitary. If the city cares so much about us as students, why not let us all go out for lunch? Being a teen, food becomes really important to us. Our bodies change, our apetite changes. School lunch for the most part, a lot of us don't eat. There are reasons like, it doesn't hold you for the rest of the day, etc. Say I eat school lunch, probably like the period after, I'd get hungry yet again because not only do they limit the lunch food, but it's not enough for most of our apetities. If we get hungry, the hungrier we get, the more distracted we will be during classes. Which will distract other students. It's like a domino effect! Also, The DOE would probably save a lot of money. Like I've mentioned before, Not a lot of students value the lunch food provided by the school. If all high school students were allowed to leave campus to pick up some lunch, that money that would of gone in the school lunch could of been used for something the school and the students in the school would value. Like new sports gear, better seats and tables etc. We sit in classrooms ALL day. No sunlight, no freshair. Just the captivity of some grey walls and a hallway cramped up constantly with other people. Taking a break from the school, the odors, the captivity would be gradually appriciated. Refreshing our minds before the next few classes would really help us probably focus more, be in a happier environment. It would really, really benefit us. These are just a few basic reasons as to why high school students should be allowed to leave campus for lunch. It would help the community inside of the school, us as students. Even the teachers. Not having to deal with students constantly complaining about disgusting school lunch, and how hungry they are can really add up a lot don't you think? In Austin, you can't, unless you are signed out by a legal guardian who is 18 or older. That means a senior could sign you out, right? No. They can only sign you out in an emergency. Also, a senior can sign themselves out for lunch if they're 18. At my school, as long as you have off campus privileges you can go out for lunch. Basically as long as you're a junior or senior and haven't done anything against school rules (cheating, fighting, etc.)",

        "a": "Eventually, yes. Next year, no. Lonzo Ball or whomever they draft this summer is not going to change the stars for the Lakers. They will need a great free agent to become good again. And they will need a superstar (like Kobe, Shaq, Magic, etc) to bring them to contention. That's going to take some time Why did Shaq and Kobe fight? Will the Lakers draft Lonzo Ball? What is a Laker? Why is Kobe Bryant rated so highly among NBA greats? Why did Lakers sign Steve Blake? The Los Angeles Lakers has been known to be synonymous to championships, but right now they have taken a few steps back. Now without Kobe Bryant, they have assembled a young core through the draft consisting of the following: D\u2019Angelo Russell Jordan Clarkson Julius Randle Brandon Ingram Ivica Zubac Well, the first 4 players should be mainstays on the team. I\u2019m not quite sure if Zubac is the center for the future for L.A. They have the 2nd overall pick in this year\u2019s draft and UCLA\u2019s  Lonzo Ball  might be donning purple and gold for next season. They might trade that pick, presumably for Pacers superstar  Paul George , but they are far from being really competitive. I say 3\u20134 seasons before they regain that former glory in the West, barring any major injuries/trades involving the aforementioned players. I\u2019m positive they\u2019ll win upwards of 35 next season. The season after that, they\u2019ll qualify for the playoffs. Brandon Ingram has the ideal mix of athleticism, length and skill. He needs to gain some muscle, get a consistent three point shot and develop a midrange game. With today\u2019s analytics, coaching and fitness regime, he\u2019ll be able to tick off at least two of those three by the beginning of next season. His dad\u2019s a prick, but Lonzo Ball can pass well, shoot consistently and has great basketball IQ. The Lakers\u2019 centerpieces will be these two guys. Add D\u2019Angelo at the two and you have a solid backcourt. That much talent is already enough to make them competitive. They need a stretch center who can protect the rim well. They\u2019ve got Randle at the 4. This guy can play a Draymond-like role when needed and doesn\u2019t lack for hustle. Building up the bench with a bunch of \u201c3&D\u201d guys and a few playmakers is the last step towards developing this team. Like I said, 35+ wins in the 17\u201318 season and playoffs in the 18\u201319 season. At some point, yes. A little over 20 years ago, the Lakers sucked. Magic retired due to HIV. Worthy and the rest of the ShowTime core retired because they was old. They sucked. They drafted a guy named Eddie Jones and they still sort of sucked. They got a little better until they finally landed Shaq in free agency. They also gambled on a high school player and were able to get solid career veterans to join and were great until Kobe got injured. The D-Howard Steve Nash experiment failed miserably. They've had a really hard time attracting talent since then. What I could see happening in the next few years is some strong talent like KAT, Anthony Davis and/or Porzingis will get sick of playing for such dog shit team and will form a SuperTeam in LAL with the current roster as role/bench players. Of Course, Lakers Fans here Here we go We are on the right path of rebuilding process, we secure top picks in last 3 years( Ingram #2, D\u2019Angelo #2, Randle #7 also #2 pick 2017) We also have low pick but very potential player like Clarkson #46, Larry Nance Jr # 27, Zubac #32 Let them get a lot minute play, and hold them to not go anywhere We just need to bring Star player like Paul George or Jimmy Butler, and wait a year to playoff, 2 year to conf semifinal, 3 year to be NBA Champion",

        "a": "The strings are under far less tension on a guitar and the tuning pegs themselves are turned much more easily. The pegs on a piano are very stiff, have way more resistance to turning and the string gauges are much heavier. Also, the guitar moves as it's being played not to mention the way the strings are pressed, bent and oscillated. A piano has a hammer that strikes the string pretty much the same way each time. Is it worth it to learn to tune a piano? How do I get guitar pick out of guitar? Why does my guitar sound out of tune when I put a capo on? How do you tune a violin using a piano? How much does it cost to tune a grand piano? Off my head I can think of four reasons. There are probably more! Because the guitar strings are much much lighter gauge than the piano strings. Their stretching characteristic is very different to the piano strings. On a guitar a very small change in tension causes a fairly noticeable change in pitch. Gut guitar strings are also much more subject to temperature and humidity variation than wire wound strings. The strings of a piano are hammered with a felt hammer with an impact that is low compared to the string mass and tension. The strings of a guitar are plucked or strummed with a force that is high compared to string mass and tension. The body of the guitar itself is not as rigid as the frame of a piano, and can be affected by temperature and humidity change. Enjoy your music! Simply because of the mobility of a guitar. A piano does not move - ever. From the time of one tuning to the other, the strings have never been moved at all. Obviously, in the case of moving a piano (from one house to another - from one room to another) a tuning would be needed. However, in general, pianos don't move. Guitars, on the other hand,  never  stay in one place. The simple act of picking up the guitar from its case can have an impact on the tuning. Another factor is the fact that the very nature of the guitar requires constant shortening and lengthening on the strings. Pressing down on the 5th fret shortens the vibrating string, while moving down to the 2nd fret lengthens it. This - over time - also affects tuning. A guitar is made entirely of wood and wood adsorbs and releases moisture based on humidity in the air. Water in wood can expand and contract the wood enough to effect tuning. Plus the tuning pegs and buttons holding the strings at the opposite end are subject to slipping from time to time. Guitar strings are thin and they are stretched past the point of yield, they deform, bend. In comparison, the piano, especially newer ones have cast iron sound boards that are not affected by temperature or humidity. Plus the strings, especially where they are attached and the mechanisms for tuning are much more robust and less likely to slip. The strings are also larger diameter and more robust. Guitar strings eventually break and piano strings never break. Well perhaps they do but this is highly unlikely to ever happen. Piano strings are longer and more tolerant to movement without affecting the tuning. However, pianos do get out of tune and need tuning on an annual basis before they get noticeable out of tune. However, you can not take a guitar tuner and use it to tune a piano. Actually the notes of the piano have to be slightly tuned \u201coff-key\u201d something most people would not know. Also, anyone who has replaced strings on a guitar know how difficult it is get tuning correct and that is only 6 strings not 88. The guitar is only two octaves and the piano is octaves. Tuners tell you what note is played but not the octave. This is a really good question as there is quite a difference between the two instruments. Many pianos function even over 100 years old with lots of use. Guitars do wear out and I have worn two of from excessive playing. About 10 years of daily playing is about the maximum life you will get from a guitar.",

Most of the scrips that trades on the stock exchange quality to be traded if one looks into cost factor, \u2018cos most of the company provide a volatility more than the cost involved (overlooking certain illiquid stocks and also those where the ATR is too low to initiate a trade). The second part that we need to look into is the risk factor. Unfortunately risk factor is not common for all, for instance I may find ATR more than five is risky to trade and there are people who trade in stocks whose mean volatility factor is high. In so far as Eicher Motors is concerned the volatility factor for the past one year on a daily basis is more than Rs.500 a day, which is quite risky, just in case you are caught on the wrong side of the trade. The best way to trade OR select stock to trade will necessarily have to be based on the targeted monthly expectation (profits one wants to make) in (say) one month\u2019s time. Having determined the targeted income per month, it is prudent to divide it by 21 trading days. This will provide us an idea as to what one wants to earn on a daily basis (you may factor some extra points here, taking into the possibility of loss oriented trades). Once per day expectation is arrived at, divide the amount based on your trading style (say if you are a swing trader, or a scalper, or a carry forward player, etc). In other words, if you execute five trades a day, simply divide your targeted daily income by five, which will give you the targeted income per trade. If your targeted income per trade is say Rs.500/-, then you don\u2019t need to trade in shares like Eicher Motors; companies like Gujarat Ambuja, India Cement, PowerGrid, ACC, TataGlobal, Tata Chemicals, will give you that kind of income with lot less risk. If you are trading for living - avoid Eicher Motors. Can we book a profit in two days\u2019 trading? Is it possible to make decent profit out of day trading? Is day trading profitable?

        "a": "I\u2019m going to go a little contrary to opinion here and say that the best sailboat to learn on is the biggest and best type of boat you\u2019re interested in sailing. Don\u2019t go into debt for it, but get the biggest that you can afford. If you\u2019re interested in cabin-cruising but you have a limited budget, find a used but serviceable boat on Craigslist. Restoring an old boat is the fastest way to learn about what it takes to sail and live aboard a vessel. Do your research, and then do the work, and you\u2019ll be surprised at how much you\u2019ve learned. If you\u2019ve got the money for a new yacht, by all means, buy the biggest one that appeals to you. Then hire a coach to teach you how to sail it. You\u2019ve probably got the money to hire other people to do maintenance for you too, but it\u2019s worth spending time with them to learn how the systems work in case something goes wrong at sea. And if you are just interested in skimming across a pond or a harbor, then get a sunfish or dinghy sailor. Some people think they\u2019re a blast. I hated sailing little boats, as a kid. And it made me hate sailing in general. The constant awkward tacking, capsizing, shouting, etc. - it seemed like we were either becalmed or drowning. And that freakin\u2019 boom hit me in the skull so many times that I gave up on sails and stuck to my canoe. When I got married my wife  insisted  we get a boat. We settled on a 30\u2032 Morgan that was built before I was born. I read a book on the physics of sailing and another on the maintenance of the engine. When we launched it, I couldn\u2019t believe how fun and satisfying it was to sail a boat this size. The engine was always ready if things went wrong, and the boat gave me time to think about what I was doing. The boom was high enough that it didn\u2019t brain me when we came about. We could set the sails and keep a hand lightly on the tiller and cruise along for hours, while we ate sandwiches and drank cocktails. So while the principles of sailing are the same no matter the size of your boat, the  experience  is entirely different. There\u2019s little point in learning to sail a boat that\u2019s a lot different from what you want to have. If my wife and I had taken beginning sailing classes or tried out a Sunfish or a dinghy before sailing something bigger, I\u2019d have turned away and never come back. Instead, we went from zero knowledge to comfortable blue-water cruising in a few months. I want to troll a couple fishing lines off my sailboat while sailing in the San Francisco Bay. What should I do to maximize my chances of catc... Sailing: What is the best type of sailboat for circumnavigating the globe? My husband and I are planning to be away for 3-4 years. What is the best way to learn how to sail? What is the best way to teach yourself how to sail a boat? What is a sailboat? I\u2019ve got a slightly different take on this question: I think the best learning sailboat is a single-handed dinghy. A Laser would be fine (maybe with the smaller rig) but its not the only option. This is why: there is a direct relationship between the tiller, the sheet, and where you sit (i.e. the position of your weight has a strong effect on the boat). There is almost no way to describe in simple terms how these three controls interact. You have to feel it, and it comes with practice. If you have one hand on the tiller, and the sheet in your other hand, you can feel the relationship. You will benefit from an instructor too of course, but the real learning comes from you feeling the boat. Your hand on the tiller feels the force of the water. Your hand on the sheet feels the force of the wind. And with your weight you try to keep the boat from turning upside down (that will probably be your first thought anyway). That\u2019s how I learned to sail. I was 12 years old, and the boat 8\u2032 long, much smaller than a Laser. Tim Elliot has answered the question. A dinghy large enough for two adults - instructor and student - to begin. The same boat may then be used for two beginners with the instructor following along in a powered boat. When I taught basic sailing, we required students be able to swim at least 100 ft without PFD before we began lessons. Then after a couple hours of instructions, students were taught how to recover from a capsize - for that exercise they did wear PFDs. Kids are easier to teach than adults, they don\u2019t mind getting wet. A stable day-sailer is best initially so you can get adjusted comfortably to \u201ctipping\u201d or heeling as you are learning the basics. It really will depend on who is teaching you and how far you would like to go as a sailor! Once you learn the general principles of sailing, points of sail, mechanics and physics of sailing and get used to heeling and going fast, a higher performance sailboat like a J22 may be in order. Don\u2019t underestimate the importance of good instruction early\u2014it lasts a lifetime. A good sailing school like the Annapolis Sailing School or Key West Sailing School is worth the week vacation! A sailing dinghy. Because it reveals your mistakes to you, and quickly too! That really helps the learning process. Bigger boats, especially keelboats, respond so slowly that other influences (wind shifts, wave action, momentum) interfere with you learning what is cause and what is effect.",

        "a": "Following is the complete question that was asked in comment section of this question and can be seen in edit log of this question: Newton said that an object will stay in motion forever if it starts moving, exept if some force interects with it (he didn't really say this but he meant this) so if you spin a top in a place with no gravity (not necessarily space) it will keep on spinning, but if you spin it in a place with even a little bit of gravity, that gravity will stop it. So my question is that even though earth has its own gravity and the gravity around it by the other planets (at least a little), why doesnt it stop. Following is the original statement (English Translation) of First Law of Motion: Now see that either luckily or through applying his profound insight and wisdom,  Newton has NOT used the word gravity as retarding factor for a spinning top. Then Einstein expressively stated that gravity was not a force. He was right but he reached to this right conclusion on the basis of faulty reasoning. He reached to this conclusion on the basis of his so called \u2018happiest idea\u2019 (1907) that free falling frame is an inertial frame. But the fact which he did not disclose and whole science community failed to pick was that this \u2018happiest idea\u2019 was in fact an inaccurate plagiarized version of Newton\u2019s Principia\u2019s Corollary VI: By Corollary VI, not only a free falling frame but in fact every kind of uniformly accelerated frame would internally be an inertial frame. So if Einstein would be sitting in an accelerating rocket, he would have concluded that only accelerating rocket is an inertial frame and rocket fuel is not a force but is a curvature of spacetime. So in above faulty way Einstein had reached to this truth that gravity is not a force. He did not know exactly why gravity is not a force. Exactly why gravity is not a force? Gravity is not a force. But reason is not happiest idea. So why exactly gravity is not a force? A force is what can produce a motion and also can stop a motion. Well, gravity is able to initiate or produce motion  but gravity is not able to stop motion. Since gravity is not able to stop motion, therefore gravity is NOT a force. It can be said that if we throw a ball upwards, it stops after a certain height before falling back; thus gravity has successfully stopped a motion. I explain this problem in two ways. Firstly suppose that gravity is due to upward accelerating earth of 1g. With this setup what happens actually? I throw a ball upward with a constant velocity. Earth is also accelerating upward. After a while, upward accelerating earth will catch up the upward moving ball and it will appear that ball has stopped before starting falling downward.  Actually ball has not stopped . Ball is still moving up as there is no downward pressure of gravity at all because our gravity model is upward accelerating earth. Ball has not stopped. Only thing happened is that speed of upward accelerating earth has become equal with the constant upward moving speed of ball. The next moment ball would appear to start falling downward.  Actually ball still would be going upward  only thing would be that the speed of upward accelerating earth would have surpassed the constant upward speed of ball. Thus here we have seen that gravity has basically failed to stop upward moving ball. Only downward motion influenced by gravity overrun the upward inertial motion of ball. Now I try to explain it in second way. Half the part has already been explained in above example where we have seen that a ball was apparently moving upward and downward at the same time. Now I go a step further and claim that in fact a body can move forward and backward in space at the same time. For example a ship is moving towards direction N. Now on that moving ship, a man can move toward W (or towards any other direction) at the same time. Our Earth is moving through space towards a certain direction. Now I can move on this earth on any other direction and my net direction in space will be different at the same time. While orbiting Earth, Moon is also moving along the path of Earth\u2019s orbit around Sun. Now sometimes Moon is moving in same direction of Earth and may be sometimes moving in opposite direction of Earth. Now come to our usual Earth with usual gravity. Now I throw a ball upward. Gravity of Earth will not interfere in the upward inertial movement of ball but will keep directing the upward moving ball to downward accelerate. After a while due to downward acceleration, downward speed will become equal with upward speed of ball. It will appear that ball has stopped. After that point, downward speed will get greater and greater but upward speed will remain the same. Ball will appear to only falling downward. Upward moving ball has not been stopped by gravity. In fact gravity has not interfered in the inertial motion of ball. Neither gravity can stop motion of an object nor can interfere in inertial motion of an object. Gravity only can issue additional directions. Those directions will be added to the motion which is already possessed by the object. Gravity is neither Force nor a curvature of spacetime. Gravity is an information system which dictates objects when, where and how much to move. Gravity cannot stop an already moving object. Now we can address to the main question. We have seen that gravity is not able to stop motion. Thus mere presence of gravity would not affect Spinning of Earth and thus first law of motion is not violated. But Tidal Force is a collateral effect of gravity and it behaves like a real force. Due to Tidal Forces, Earth has effectively slowed down the spinning of moon and spinning of moon has been tidally locked with earth.

According to Newton's first law of motion, a rocket does not need fuel to travel in space till forever once it is given an acceleration as the... Why does something having gravity stop it spinning? In a way, you could say that the force of gravity is what keeps it spinning. Without gravity, everything would travel in straight lines and the Earth would disintegrate. These are two different things by the way. The gravitation is the force between the earth and our sun, among countless other examples, which is what keeps the earth in its orbit, unable to reach the escape velocity by itself to get knocked out of its already long established elliptical orbit. Now the initial self axial spin that the earth had during the time of its earliest formation is what it will continue to have with very slight variations over billions of years. Since there is no resistance to movement in a vacuum(as opposed to say the atmospheric resistance on earth) earth will continue to rotate around its axis with no force to slow it down. So that is the Newton\u2019s first law in perpetual action here! An object will not move and stay inertial until a force is applied on it to make it move, or an object that already has a force acting on it making it move at a certain velocity, will stay in motion exactly that way until another force acts on it to change its velocity or path. In short with no retarding force or friction due to absence of atmosphere in the vacuum of space, the forces in action do not diminish or change with time, and motion continues in the same way for eons\u2026 Kaiser T, MD. It is gravity that makes the planet rotate. Each point on the surface is accelerating toward the center at 32 feet per second squared, but cannot fall down, so the force is directed at an angle. It is not angular momentum, which is inertia, it is gravitic force directed at an angle; angular momentum is an elementary school common mistake in definitions. the next obvious question is, why does everything rotate this way and not that? because the Earth started of at some point as a big space rock tumbling in some arbitrary direction, most of which were lined up with the turning of the gas as it orbited the sun. thus, most of the planets, with the exception of neptune (which rotates along its axis probably as the result of some colossal collision) all spin the same direction. Because they all started off as gas and dust orbiting the sun with that orientation.",

        "a": "Honestly, don't try to change yourself. There are two probable outcomes for this idea: either you will be miserable by trying to be something you're not or you won't be able to act like an extrovert. Believe me, I've been down that road. We (introverts) live in a world where the \u201cright\u201d way is the extroverted way: you need to be charismatic, magnetic, surrounded with people all the time, talkative and overconfident. I frequently used to catch myself thinking what was the deal with my behavior, why I could not be what everyone expected me to be. After some research involving the psychology behind introversion and extraversion (I highly recommend the book The Power of Introverts, by Susan Cain) I realized my introversion was not a problem, it was just a personality trait, just a different way to react to the world and to interact with it. It feels sometimes that introversion is a bad thing, when it is actually a powerful resource in many situations. You should accept who you are, embrace your introversion, believe me, it feels great. Introverts have a lot of good traits, even when most of people say the opposite and ignore them. Being an introvert does not mean you cannot interact with people or it\u2019s always uncomfortable to do it; it means that we get tired by doing it and need some time alone to recharge (I love spending time alone, this is really a big deal for introverts). Try to understand more about yourself and to accept who you are, it will make you feel better than trying to be something you are not. How do I know if I am an introvert? What does it feel like to be an introvert? Is it okay to be introverted? Should people, in general, try to be more extroverted? What are some tips to accept myself as an introvert and not being stressed about trying to be social? How should an introvert approach a woman he likes? Should he try to be an extrovert or be himself? I was shy as a child. As a young adult I avoided approaching people or starting a conversation. As an older adult I took a job that involved knocking on the doors of strangers and asking them a series of personal questions for government surveys. I learned to put aside feelings of discomfort in order to do my job. Now that I don\u2019t work in that job anymore, I find that the skill to approach people and just start talking has stayed with me. I reason that no matter how difficult the conversation becomes, it can\u2019t compare to the number of rude, obnoxious encounters I had during eight years of government work. So, yes, it is possible to acquire skills of interaction with people. However, the introvert part of me never changed. I still prefer my own company. I love to nerd out in solitude. I have little use for shallow people who have no desire to really know me or who want me to change to suit their needs. Be comfortable being the introvert you are. Add conversational skills and the ability to talk to anyone about anything as you find it necessary in your life for work or certain social situations. Just know and accept who you are on the inside. The eventual solitude you\u2019ll seek out will be worth the temporary uneasiness you feel around other people. You need to accept yourself as you are and learn that if others don\u2019t accept you, that is their problem not yours. I too started as an introvert. However in my long fight to overcome my shyness and social anxiety, I have become a lot more outgoing and now consider myself to be an ambivert, but the change was a gradual one over the course of many many years and wasn\u2019t deliberate. I am not sure if you could force it because to some degree you are just either wired as an introvert or wired as an extrovert so you may as well get used to what you are. Yes, there are things that are annoying as an introvert, like people saying you are too quiet. I sometimes get that though now that I am more outgoing I don\u2019t get it as often as I used to. Sometimes when I get irritated with people telling me I am too quiet, I will reply that they talk too much, that gets them quiet in a hurry. I had a stranger ask me why I was so quiet and in my head I thought it was because I wasn\u2019t really interested in him but I knew that telling him that would hurt him so I didn\u2019t say anything. It is your life, if you don\u2019t like something about yourself, change it. Otherwise accept the hand that you are dealt and play it to the best of your ability. Don\u2019t change for other people, no one is perfect and others should fix all of their own problems before they comment on other people. You should be comfortable with yourself. Introvert is not a personality disorder, it\u2019s just a type of personality.",

If they squeak through through to the group stage they will get no less than Euros 20 million. A winner could take home Euros 100 million this year. This is only prize money. There are many other income sources that flow from participation in the CL. You cannot give a side like Millwall the fourth English place in the CL.  First , they would be wiped off the map.

What's your reaction on Real Madrid's expulsion from Copa Del Rey Cup? Where are Bradford City's 1911 FA Cup winners' medals? Who will win the UEFA Euro Cup in 2016 and why? I understand the rationale in rewarding cup winners. Some of these historic competitions are often ignored by large teams due to relatively less commercial return. We also see some minnows winning it time to time who would get a shot at participating in UCL. But if the idea of UCL is to involve strongest teams from these countries, league may be a more accurate measure. Also, big teams may start stockpiling talent even more to compete across multiple fronts minimizing the odds for an upset. Most interesting aspects of these competitions are occasional giant killing which we all enjoy. Hence current model is the best. Let big teams continue to focus on other competitions leaving the opportunity for glory to so called smaller teams. A big NO !!! Cup winners can be from the respective league , 1st division , 2nd division \u2026and may be from the 4th\\5th\\6th Division\u2026you never know in football. Lets say that a team from 1st\\2nd\\3rd division wins the FA cup\\DFB Pokal\\Copa Del Rey\u2026..so they get eligible for chance to play in UCL\u2026. This sounds totally ridiculous that a non-league team is playing in UCL !!!!! UCL is meant for the clubs who plays in the top Level League in their respective countries. Hope i answer your query :) No, it will lesser the quality of football in the league. All clubs would instantly focus their attention to said cup. So instead of all out battle between say, a Liverpool and Manchester United match to gain an upper hand in the race in the league, both teams would instead play their reserve players because why bother trying so hard to get the 4th or 3rd position and have to play the best while hoping the other team lost points while you can just use the cup route to get to the UCL. Top teams like Chelsea, MU, Bayern Munic, Barcelona and Real Madrid would definitely aim to the top or face the wrath of their fans but the middle teams? They won\u2019t even tries to be good at the league most of the time. You would instead get a competitive cup matches and incredibly boring league matches where everyone deploys their second team and rest the first team for cup matches. 4th place competitor could be a team which can end by winning title if there is less point difference. 4th place make league competitive. Mid table teams which could not make top4 every year but plays brilliantly in cup game and by chance they won the cup, imagine there situation at Champions league they will get thrashed by top teams.

        "a": "Two Truths and Two Lies About Where the Fat Goes When You Lose Weight We give this age-old question the popular dinner party game treatment. This is where your fat really goes when you lose weight. It\u2019s a happy day when you start to see the numbers tick lower on your scale. But have you ever stopped to consider where the fat actually goes? Researchers at UNSW School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences in Sydney, Australia did. Here we reveal their findings in a round of Two Truths and Two Lies (because two lies are more fun than one)! Can you spot the two lies below? #1 Fat turns into muscle. #2 Fat disappears into thin air. #3 Fat is converted into heat. #4 You pee the fat out. \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (READ ON) \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 Lie: Fat turns into muscle. Fat and muscle are made up of two entirely different types of tissue; fat is adipose and muscle is protein. That means no matter how many salads you eat or squats you do, fat will never turn into muscle. You may think this is the case if you\u2019re exercising, because you do burn fat as fuel during aerobic workouts and you may also be increasing your muscle mass through weight lifting. Then as you start to lose weight, your muscles may seemingly come out of hiding and become more pronounced as you shed the layers of fat. But it will never, ever turn into muscle. The good news is, if you start to lapse on your diet and exercise program, muscle won\u2019t turn into fat either. Truth: It disappears into thin air. Most of the weight you lose is converted into carbon dioxide and you exhale it out of your system. The researchers found that when you eat more carbs and proteins than you expend calorically, they are converted into triglycerides. The triglycerides are then stored in lipid droplets inside your fat cells. When you lose weight, you need oxygen (while burning lots of calories) to break down the triglycerides to access the carbon dioxide. The study found that in 10 kilograms of \u201clost\u201d fat, 8.4 kilograms are exhaled as carbon dioxide through your lungs. Lie: Fat is converted into heat. If you picked this one as the truth, you\u2019re in good company: more than half of the doctors, dieticians and personal trainers in a survey conducted by the study\u2019s authors believed this to be true. But it\u2019s physically impossible and violates the  Law of Conservation of Mass . Truth: You pee it out. The remaining 1.6 kilograms of the \u201clost\u201d fat become water and are excreted via urine, sweat, tears, breath and other bodily fluids. Why is it so hard to lose weight? Where does fat go when we lose weight. What happens to it? What is the best way to reduce belly fat and overall weight? Do we lose weight after going to the toilet? Should I go on a diet to lose weight? There's 2 questions implied here: Where does fat go? Where does weight go? Believe it or not, these are two entirely different questions. Fat loss is not always weight loss and weight loss is not always fat loss. The quick answer is: Fat shrinks through direct conversion to energy and through energy redistribution within your body. Weight is shed through a number of places, from sweating, to urination, to defecation, to exhalation of carbon dioxide, to heat radiation. We have 2 main types of dynamic soft tissue in our body: adipose tissue and muscle tissue. Adipose tissue is your body's energy store, it's your gas tank, basically. Your muscle tissue is your engine and everything that keeps you moving. Muscle is much denser than fat. If you gain muscle and lose fat, you'll look skinnier and could end up weighing more in the process. I'll start with where fat goes and circle back to where weight goes. So where does fat go? When you're fasted and at rest, your body gets 60%-70% of it's energy from fat, the rest comes from glycogen stores ( more on that later ). Fat is stored in  Adipocytes , or fat cells, which make up adipose tissue, or fat tissue. An adult has about 8 million adipocytes and they don't ever go away (though they are replaced gradually over the course of years as the cells are maintained). When you eat, some of the food you eat is stored in them. As ou eat the cells grow. When you gain fat, they're swollen, and sometimes will split into two (like shares on the stock market). When you lose fat, they actually shrink. You never really kill these cells except in some extreme weight loss procedures (cryolipolysis, liposuction, etc). When you need to store fat a process called  lipogenesis  takes place. This process turns sugars and proteins and free fatty acids into trigylcerides for storage inside the fat cells. The process can take place in the liver or inside your fat cells. Insulin is the transport mechanism that deposits things into the fat cells. [1] When your body needs energy, particular hormones (  epinephrine ,  norepinephrine ,  ghrelin ,  growth hormone ,  testosterone , and  cortisol ) will attach to the adipocytes and initiate a process called  Lipolysis . Your fat cell will turn the triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol and release them into your blood stream. They get picked up by LDLs and VLDLs and are taken to cells that need them. Fat is then processed into acetyl sugar through a process called  beta oxidation . The sugar is then used in the  citric acid cycle  to create a ton of ATP for energy. That is one of the ways that your fat cells are shrunk, for  direct energy use . The other way is because of glycogen store depletion. Glycogen is another name for stored glucose. Your body depends on glucose. It's easier to turn into ATP than fat. It can be converted into about 4 ATP, it's also smaller than ATP, and stable in water (unlike ATP) making it an ideal primary energy store for your body, plus it can create ATP without using oxygen unlike fat and amino acids. Your brain, liver, kidneys, and muscle tissue all hold glycogen, without glycogen they won't function. When your glycogen stores are low and your body doesn't have any sugar in your system from eating, it will use fat and amino acids to replenish your glycogen stores through a process called  Gluconeogenesis .  This is the primary method that your fat shrinks from exercise. When you start doing INTENSE exercise, your muscles won't have access to oxygen, so they have to rely on their ATP stores (and the phosphocreatine recycling) which only last a few seconds. After that, your body will use anaerobic glycolysis to create more energy. This is less efficient than aerobic glycolysis, giving 8xs fewer ATP per molecule, but it's the best your body can do under the circumstances. At the same time your aerobic energy systems kick into gear, aerobic glycolysis and lipolysis. Your body has enough glycogen to run for 2-4 hours. While your glycogen system is in use, your fat stores will start into gear. All of your aerobic systems take in oxygen and release CO2, water, and a few other metabolites. The CO2 is taken in the blood stream to your lungs to be exhaled. The water and other metabolites are taken by your blood to your liver and kidneys to be filtered out. Some of the water is kept by your body for its own uses. So how does your body lose weight? Through all of this it looks like you only redistribute your weight, doesn't it? Your body expels actual weight through several mechanisms, some of which are related directly to metabolism: Expulsion of CO2 generated from aerobic energy creation by breathing (this is not really news, we've known about this since the 1930s). You cannot sit around breathing and expect to lose weight, unless you don't eat anything, which is a really foolish way to go about things. An average person will exhale about 2.3 pounds of carbon dioxide daily. This is generally the primary source of weight loss.  [2] Expulsion of water vapor generated from aerobic energy creation by breathing. We breathe out about a pound of water over the course of the day. [3] Sweating. We sweat constantly, throughout the day, just not always noticeably, in temperate environment you'll only lose about a pound, but under more trying circumstances you could lose as much as 20 pounds, though this is not a way to lose weight \u201cpermanently\u201d, as you\u2019ll just get that water back when you eat or drink. [4]   [5]   [6] Skin and hair cell sloughing. Skin and hair cells die and are replaced constantly. Every day you lose millions of skin cells. This isn't terribly significant on a day to day basis, but you could end up shedding hundreds of pounds of skin cells over the course of your life time. [7]   [8] Urination, it's one of our body's key waste processes removing metabolites from our system. Pooping, removes food waste and effectively reduces our weight. Heat radiation. When ATP reacts, a lot of energy is lost from heat. The heat is radiated or convected from the body through a number of mechanisms. Your body burns through it's own body weight in ATP every day. It's a pretty amazing thing (though this only accounts for a small percentage of actual weight loss, since the by-products of ATP use are recycled constantly). [9] All of these different processes contribute to your losing weight from day to day. Which leads me back to my first point, your weight isn't important, your fitness is. Your weight will fluctuate by pounds from day to day, don't obsess over the weight, just aim to get fit and eat right. Your fat will shrink, your muscles will become strong. You'll look great and feel great. Here's another take on a similar question:  Bart Loews' answer to Which part of the body starts shedding weight when you start working out?

While most health experts assume lost fat is changed into heat or energy\u2014hence the words \"burned\"\u2014you actually breathe out fat like carbon dioxide. That's right. People exhale lost weight. goes into air, \" You will be surprised that 84% of this lost fat was converted to carbon dioxide. The rest becomes water, that you lose through peeing, crying, there's, or any of the various ways your body dumps H2O. According to your Law of Conservation of Mass, matter is neither created not destroyed, but it may switch its form through chemical effect. When we eat, the glucose and sugar harnessed from carbohydrates are definitely the first fuel sources. \\ The liver stores the glucose like glycogen and releases it in the bloodstream as necessary to keep our own bodies trucking along. Think of your bloodstream for an interconnected conveyor belt that takes necessary nutrients to your body parts that need these. Once that glucose runs available, fat takes over. Harnessing energy by burning fat is known as ketosis. Related: The most healthy natural options for fats loss. Can you alter your Moon face to an oval one by Yoga or exercise? Unusual and effective weight loss tips that work The best diet for weight loss. Tips took from three most inspiring weight loss transformations. AS SURPRISING AS IT MIGHT BE IN A SOCIETY OBSESSED WITH WEIGHT LOSS... VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION: YOU ACTUALLY EXHALE THE WEIGHT YOU LOSE. Excess body weight is mostly fat. Fat is made up of glycerol and fatty acids, both of which are mostly carbon. We take in carbon as a major component of our macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins and fats. When we overeat we take in an excess amount of carbon. This is why an excess of  any  of the three macronutrients (fat, protein or carbohydrates) will lead to weight gain. When we exercise we break down fat, turn it into Acetyl CoA, which enters the Citric Acid Cycle, which extracts energy as it breaks it down the carbon bonds... but what happens to the carbon atoms we've broken off the Acetyl CoA? They are used to assemble carbon dioxide (CO2), which is then deposited into the blood stream. The circulatory system then brings the CO2 to the lungs, where we exhale it as a gas. BONUS: The CO2 is then picked up from the air by plants and turn it into plant matter and wood while another process in plants releases oxygen into the atmosphere, which keeps us alive. That\u2019s the beauty of the carbon cycle! So the more you breathe the more weight you'll lose! What makes you breath the most?... EXERCISE! There is simply no way around it. But please, don't let me distract anyone from what a multi-billion dollar miracle weight-loss industry would like us all to believe! : S Check it out in a little more detail here: This answer is not a substitute for professional medical advic...",

The present day, entrepreneurs market their business and create a brand name for themselves with the help of  Android apps for their business  thus fueling the need of   android application development   . Social media can further enhance the effect, by marketing the android business app and engaging into the process of creating a brand name for the company. http://www.mobileapptelligence.c... I am a newbie. How can I find help with these Android app development queries? Do the battery saver applications actually work? If they do, which is the best battery saver application for Android? How is the growth of the Android app development companies in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt? How Android app development companies are helping enterprises in UAE, Egypt and Turkey? How do I find the best app development company to hire dedicated Android app developers in India? Mobile app development companies contribute a lot to businesses in UAE, Egypt, Turkey and the Middle East. It has been almost 1.3 years since I started working at  ContractIQ  - a global market place for web and mobile app development firms across the world. I\u2019ve come across clients who run established businesses, looking to get more customers by building a mobile app. With a smart phones being used by almost everyone these days, established business look to cash in by launching their mobile app. This would inturn bring them a lot of customers apart from their existing customers. App development firms have contributed in taking their client\u2019s business to the next level. Even startups have been able to acquire seed funding by building mobile apps for their innovative ideas. Initially a lot of business started to flow from America when they wanted to outsource their mobile app development requirements to the Indian market for cheap labour. This was the reason why Indian dev agencies began to have a sales presence in US. They\u2019d get projects from US clients and do development in India. Since 80% of the clients have stopped outsourcing their requirements to Indian companies, 10% of Indian app development firms have started to outsource data science and data analytics requirements for US clients while the remaining 90% are targeting Middle East and Africa. This is where we come in handy. At  ContractIQ , we\u2019ve helped over 4000 clients to connect with the right app development agency. We understand and analyse our clients requirements and connect them with teams who might have worked on something similar to what they\u2019re looking for. Generally we give them 2\u20133 team to begin with based on clients requirement, budget constraint and location preference. The success rate has been over 95%. The expectations of the client and vendor must be met to enable smooth outsourcing. We\u2019ve published a  report  on app development trends for the fourth consecutive year. Apart from this, we\u2019ve also built  TrystWithData  - a global platform for data science and data analytics firms across the world. We have a network of Big Data consulting companies trusted by the likes of Philips, Air Asia and Siemens.",

A dumb password is one that can easily be brute-force numbercrunched by a script. To protect yourself against brute-force password guessing, the thing that protects you the most is password length. The longer the password, the more information in the password and the longer the script has to guess. Assuming that using morse code lengthens your password and/or that scripts start their iterations with a and end with punctuation marks, it might actually be slightly smarter to use morse code for a password.

Not that worried about it. I can see some advantages. Having only two or three characters in your password makes it so you can type it very quickly with only one hand, and it would make it really difficult for someone watching to \u201cread\u201d it off your fingers. If those three characters include a digit and a special character, then you meet the general criteria for password safety, so that\u2019s also good.

The way this question is phrased, however, suggests a possible misconception. In the prevailing theory (the aforementioned Standard Model and its basis, which is quantum field theory) particles are not fundamental entities. They are merely excitations of quantum fields, and as such, they come and go: they are created and annihilated all the time. The Standard Model consists of a set of fields: fermionic fields such as one field for each fundamental fermionic particle (six quarks, three charged leptons like the electron, and three uncharged neutrinos); bosonic fields for the photon, the massive vector bosons of electroweak theory, gluons of the strong interaction; and the Higgs field. There is one field for each  type  of particle: for instance, there is only one electromagnetic field in the universe, even though there can be a gigantic number of photons, which are its excitations. Excitations (particles) are created or destroyed when fields interact with each other. As to the fields themselves, they simply  are . Their existence is a fundamental property of our physical universe, just as its dimensions are. There is no process that would form them; they always existed, albeit in a different form in the extreme early universe, before spontaneous symmetry breaking. What are electrons made up of? Are all electrons made of the same material? Are electrons made from quarks? May I please receive a legitimate, comprehensive explanation as to whether electrons are or are not particles, and why they are sometimes call... What causes a particle to have a charge? If an atom is made up of protons, electrons, and neutrons, then where do particles such as bosons, quarks, etc. come into the picture? Okay students of the Gordon Model of Physics\u2026 We have some teaching to do to the conventional overlords of physics and their best spokesperson\u2026 Prof Toth. Let\u2019s start with Prof Toth\u2019s Answer. I\u2019ll go one paragraph at a time and then comment: TOTH: \u201cThe Standard Model of particle physics pretty much tells you how these particles arise as excitations of fundamental quantum fields, and how those quantum field acquired their current form as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\u201d GORDON: According to current physics theory, particles are excitation of a pre-existing fundamental quantum field. The idea of symmetry breaking means that the field is a distortion in the pre-existing fundamental quantum field from its underlying existence. The problem with this theory is that there is no explanation as to what creates the multitude of fundamental quantum fields required for all the energy fields we know exists? TOTH: The way this question is phrased, however, suggests a possible misconception. In the prevailing theory (the aforementioned Standard Model and its basis, which is quantum field theory) particles are not fundamental entities. They are merely excitations of quantum fields, and as such, they come and go: they are created and annihilated all the time. GORDON: There is no misconception in the phrasing of your quesion - The question is\u2026 How were elementary particles such as quarks and electrons created? What is mis-conceived is the current understanding that physicists are trying to force down our throats. This is the only solution that physicists can come with so that they can keep the current framework of the math representing their current model intact. This model keeps spacetime as made of nothing but ironically adds the multitude of fundamental quantum fields everywhere. This is most understood for the explanation of the Higgs field and the Higgs mechanism. Physicists kept the current model alive by saying that the Higgs Boson creates the Higgs Field that permeates all of spacetime. When a particle interacts with the Higgs field, it has the property of mass. Excuse me\u2026 but doesn\u2019t it make more sense to consider that spacetime is an energy field with its own energy permeating through it? And guess what - You can also consider that it would this energy that is the energy that is known to be \u201cmissing\u201d in current theory. YIKES!!! I can\u2019t go into the erroneous notion of virtual particles coming and going all the time\u2026 I\u2019ll save that for another embarrassing moment in physics history. TOTH: As to the fields themselves, they simply  are . Their existence is a fundamental property of our physical universe, just as its dimensions are. There is no process that would form them; they always existed, albeit in a different form in the extreme early universe, before spontaneous symmetry breaking. GORDON: I said this once but since it is so funny - I will say this again\u2026 Toth answered this question the same way my mommy answered my questions when I was 3 year old\u2026 \u201cBecause I said so\u201d. Toth, you are not my mommy!!! So you say the the fields simple are\u2026 as are our dimensions\u2026 Fundamental properties that simply are and we are not allowed to question the great minds of physics! LOL! I can show you in mathematical terms the process by which the known dimensions came to exist right here in this paper\u2026 Hidden Dimensions?... Not So Hidden After All In regards to how energy fields come to exist\u2026 The short answer is that they are created when the E1 and/or E2 energy of particles \u201cin\u201d spacetime interact with the E0 energy associated with the GOD (Gordon Omnipresent Dot) entities \u201cof\u201d spacetime. The GOD entity is the building block component of spacetime. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything shows the math that creates the energy fields we all know - AND the real exciting part.. it EVEN shows how a gravitational field is created!!! What is missing from current physics is the hierarchy of energy and how the E0 energy before the big bang jumped up to higher Gordon Energy States during the big bang and became unable to jump back to the E0 energy state. A brief description of what the heirarchy of energy represents can be found here\u2026  \"Why Can't the LHC Find New Math?\"  BTW - most of the energy of the universe stayed in theE0 energy form of spacetime. The time is coming when all physicists will have to (YES HAVE TO) start reading my book. You may as well get the jump on your colleagues and start rederiving everything using the correct foundation on which the entire field of physics needs to be rebuilt. The mainstream doesn\u2019t have any answers apart from QFT which is dead in the water as it claims that there is a plethora of fields that permeate the universe and give rise to particles. QFT is only a suggestion like string theory except that QFT can give provable solutions and string theory can\u2019t. My theory goes back to a time when the universe was full of energy and the only question that needs to be answered is: how did that energy turn into matter? because the universe is matter dominated. The mainstream tells us that it turned into elctron-positron pairs and quark-antiquark pairs. However, these are matter and antimatter which annihilate each other into energy which cannot split into pairs again. Fortunately, 1 in a billion matter particles survived because the creation was skewed in favour of matter by a hitherto unknown mechanism called the matter-antimatter asymmetry. Even if the primordial energy did split into quark-antiquark pairs, these are called meson and they\u2019re extremely unstable that they decay into electrons, positrons, or photons, depending on their charge, within a handful of nanoseconds. So, in the end you have a universe full of electrons, positrons, and photons from which nucleons were formed and, eventually, atoms. There\u2019s no matter-antimatter asymmetry or quarks or Nuclear forces; just the electron, positron, photon, and the EM force between them. See  Alternative Theory of Everything  and read from the bottom post up. Yes. MC Physics suggests a theory that the elemental particles of: photons, neutrinos, electrons and (various) quarks are made of quantized electrostatic mono-charges that were formed in the earliest Universe and remain/exist today. That is given in: \u201cMC Physics Model of Sub-Atomic Particles using Mono-Charges\u201d,  http://viXra.org/pdf/1611.0080v1.pdf",

If you\u2019re a skinny guy doing a lot of cardio (running and basketball), you can\u2019t expect that taking more protein will help you build the physique of a bodybuilder.

As you grow up you will know your body better and adapt your workouts to your needs. Please do not think that taking whey protein will give some muscle!

        "a": "All my sisters, adults or even the one 10 years my junior traveled at least twice in their lives, and I didn't. My older sister when she was my age had her own car even though she lived in a small city, I live in the capital and every day I waste 2\u20133 hours commuting and public transportation is hell. Along with many details where I feel like I'm not treated equally, but also I don't nag about this. Maybe that's why my parents didn't pay that much attention to these issues. Well your answer is in your question actually.. \u2018adult siblings\u2019. I am 25 and I don't think my parents are obliged to support me anymore. They paid for my education, they pay my rent, and I still depend on them. Everything else will be a favor from them. Now if my sisters, who are pharmacists and it's a highly paying job in my country, ended up with more resources than I have, had things I wanted, had children or partners or whatever. I wouldn't feel jealous. Because I'm naturally independent and I can't settle down if I'm not happy with my situation. I\u2019 m always looking for opportunities, always improving the quality of my life and I wouldn't trade these mindset and attitude for anything in this world. So if my sisters have more resources and have better lives than I do, I'll be happy for them and take care of my own life. How can you avoid jealousy among siblings? Why is it such a big deal if I do not have any siblings? How do siblings deal with jealousy arising from economic inequality? How did you deal with the untimely death of a younger sibling? How do I deal with siblings who are ashamed of me? Jealousy is not a constructive emotion or attitude to carry around. In fact, it can be very destructive, not only to relationships but to one\u2019s own mental and physical health. If you want to be happy, look at your wealthy brother as just another human being with flaws the same as you. Relate to him as such. If he will not accept you on the same grounds, write him off. Focus on your own strengths, interests, and skills. Develop those. You may qualify for further training to get a paying job in the field of your interest. When you are doing what you enjoy and are able to meet your own needs, it will matter less how your brother is living. If your parents are still alive and playing actively into the situation, you may need to deal with this head-on. Most likely you already have told them that you need their\u2014or your brother\u2019s\u2014monetary help but they refused. That is not acceptable. Write them off, too. Make your own life, your own goals, your own friends, your own family. Get so absorbed in this that jealousy gets crowded out and loses its potency. Refuse to focus on your tough life but focus on the possibilities. Just so you know. I\u2019m on disability and have had to live in some pretty crummy places. All the while my younger brother had a big farm and hired help for his organic produce business. I asked to have a trailer set up on his farm for me to live in and offered to help with the produce. I was turned down for some pretty lame excuses. That was about ten years ago. By taking advantage of opportunities open to me, I am today in a small but very nice place. Of course, my brother has now sold his old farm and bought two new farms. Am I jealous? Not in the least. I love my own life and feel secure and happy in it. I have found friends who are like family in a way my biological family never was. Hopefully as you focus on making a life for yourself, over the long term you can achieve similar goals and contentment. Start with the little things. Enjoy what you can get for free by listening to music you can hear from the sidewalk, perhaps from outside a church on a Sunday morning if you don\u2019t feel comfortable to attend the service. Some open air festivals require admission fees but the sound of music spills onto the street. Some performances can be seen from a discreet distance outside. Nature is always free, as well as many city parks. Public libraries provide free services beyond books and reading; these days computers are a common part. You can set up your own website or play games or participate in any number of websites like Quora and Facebook. Libraries also loan music CDs, if you have the technology to use them. I hope this helps a little bit. In the meantime, if you can get career counselling (which I think should be free) and enrol in a community college for more training it might bring real solutions. Ah, the green-eyed monster which doth mock the food it feeds upon! In my experience, badly. Stop being self centered. Be glad for the other person.",

So, as a privileged member of society, I think it is my responsibility to fight for the equality of women because I recognize that they have it much much tougher than me. I believe so, yes.

        "a": "When I was 16, I found out the person whom I believed to be my older brother was really my father and my parents were really my grandparents. I was devastated by this news and I felt sick and depressed all the time. So I confided in a close friend that I trusted and told her what happened. I poured out my heart and told her everything. The next day everyone at my school knew. I was bullied relentlessly, I didn\u2019t have anymore friends, and I didn\u2019t want to go to school anymore. Everyday I was called a baby\u2019s baby (my real parents were 13 when they had me) and a \u201cbastard bitch\u201d. Then they started to make fun of my appearance, which didn\u2019t happen at all before. And guys I had crushes on would ask me out, just to say they were just joking or it was a prank. I began hating myself and who I was. I wanted the ground to swallow me up. And of course telling adults did jack-shit. One day, I was by myself, crying in my room. In my head I kept saying \u2018I wish I never existed\u2019, \u2018Why was I born this way?\u2019 and, \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I born someone else? I can\u2019t change it!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t change it,\u201d \u201cI CAN\u2019T CHANGE IT\u201d I realized I can\u2019t change who I am. They shouldn\u2019t have a say in what I feel about myself. I\u2019m not Bastard Bitch or anything else. I\u2019m Rosie. After that, I let everyone know if they called me otherwise, they would regret it. When they did, I punched them. Square in the face. I warned them already. I didn\u2019t want to use violence but that\u2019s the only language they understand apparently. Yeah, I got in trouble a few times but, I can tell you they left me alone. My grades started to go back to normal and I started to feel a bit better. I\u2019m not saying fighting is the answer to bullying and harassment but when the bulling doesn\u2019t stop then sometimes you have to stand up for yourself. I grew from this experience. I realize only I control how I feel. I\u2019m not going to let another person change how I feel about myself. That\u2019s my job. .. / .-.. --- ...- . / -.-- --- ..- / .- .- .-. --- -. What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever said in a foreign language by accident? What is the most embarrassing thing you have ever done? What is the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to you at work or in class? Which is the most awkward moment of your college life? What is your most embarrassing moment in front of the whole class? I was in 10th grade and I had a physics practical to give, there were alot of practicals to memorize, I couldnt learn all practicals so well. When I went to the school and when I got the practical, I did it well, but I was so nervous about the Viva questions. I went to another class to answer the viva questions, There were alot of girls in the class from another section (I knew them but not personally). When my teacher asked my the first question I got nervous, I couldnt give the right answer, everyone started to laugh at me, It was mortifying, my teacher asked me another question and I stumbled over my words while giving the answer, and when he asked the last question , same thing happened, I made a complete fool of myself, It was soooo embarrasing, everyone was making fun of me, I was on the verge of crying, when I came back home I cried but then this embarrasement turned into a rage, I wanted to show all those mean girls that I am better than them and then suddenly I felt that resilience, and I decided to become a much more confident , stronger and intelligent person. I invested alot of time in me, I read self help books, I gained knowledge and I tried to develop more confidence, eventually I joined coaching classes, (before joining coaching I was a diffident person, I was an introvert, I didnt have the confidence to ask questions from my teacher infront of my class) but when I joined coaching this time, I became too confident, I started to ask questions from my teachers infront of the entire class without any reluctance or hesitation, so basically because of that one embarrasing moment I ended up becoming a more confident and knowledgeable person, It actually was a blessing in a disguise. When something mortifying happens with us or when we think that we are being made fun of and we dont deserve it, we get the urge to prove everyone wrong and show them what we are actually capable of. It would depend though. Mostly embarrassing moments only wakes a person up and let them know not to make the same mistake ever again. This will let them get stronger and more alert in all aspects in life including one\u2019s self-esteem and prowess.",

        "a": "When a tourism website or anything of that sort shows you pictures, they are showing you the best parts of that place. The pictures, as a whole, will always look better, because they are carefully selected to put that country\u2019s best foot forward. In addition to that, all countries and cities have pretty parts and less pretty parts. One of my favorite cities, for example, is Salzburg, Austria. Here are photos that I took while there last March. The first picture shows one of the many beautiful sites in the city, and the second one not as much. These two photos were taken about 3 hours apart, a few mile walk between them. The first photo I took because I knew it was pretty, a beautiful view that I don't get to see often. That is what tourism websites and shows want you to see, the unique, beautiful parts of a city. The second photo I took because I liked the contrast of the castle and the highway. This is not a tourism photo, it's a photo of a memory, one that someone only gets from visiting. Bottom line, so what if it doesn't look like pictures you see online? You don't want to have the same pictures that everyone has seen before. Take pictures of the fun memories you make in a place, not because they're pretty, but because you may not experience something like it for a long time. This is a picture of a fat pigeon I saw in Austria, and I certainly had more fun seeing that fat pigeon than climbing 300+ steps to get to the first photo. Best wishes! What photos look Photoshopped but are actually real? People say that photographs of my artworks look better than the paintings in real life. What should I do? What does a typical school look like in your country? What does your country's border look like? Who is the best-looking woman from your country? Photos of landscapes, just like portraits taken by skilled photographers, show the landscape at its best. If you are just visiting, you are unlikely to get the absolute best weather, best lighting, and so forth. Part of the art of photography is choosing points of view that leave out the ugly parts, whether those are industrial sites, litter-strewn streets, clear-cut forests, or slums. My experience with backcountry photography is that the real thing is always more impressive than a photograph, and I\u2019m always pleased if I can come close to evoking the beauty of the actual scene. because its done by a person who knows how to take photos. a good photographer knows under what conditions and what light the picture will look awesome, what to include in the picture what not. i dont pretend to be a pro but i wanna give u an example. nice pic of a small mountain lake in juizhaigo national park in China. so nice calm and quite. not so to take this picture i had to fight with all the people who also wanted to take photos this is the reality. lol Best picture of many. At the best time. Best spot. Photo editing. adjusting colors and more. There is almost no limit to what you can photoshop if you really want, replace the sky, remove or add people. etc. If colors are not directly edited, then your monitor simply can be more vibrant at default. The camera person used could had had boosted the colors. I however still think nothing can beat the quality of seeing with your own eyes. I get what you mean thought. because of a thing called photoshop.",

Remember ADHD involves an abnormality in focus, but that doesn't mean people with ADHD cannot focus. It means that if something bores you, you find it more difficult than \"normal\" people to focus, but, equally, if something interests you, you can concentrate on it so deeply that you can lose sense of space and time. That's actually an advantage over people whose focus is more or less the same across different topics. So you need to be very intentional over the sort of subjects you choose and the sort of work you pursue. Where there's just no getting round taks which you find difficult to concentrate on, break them down into small chunks, and give yourself movement breaks in between times. If you find yourself forgetting to do things, set up audible alarms and reminders. Try to get good rest and nutrition, because your ability to concentrate will nose dive if you're tired or hungry. And don't be ashamed of your ADHD. Many successful and celebrated people have ADHD. One of my sons has it, and he is a fantastic human being who has been described in school reports as energetic and highly creative as well as \"sparky\" and \"charismatic.\" I think those positive attributes are actually intimately intertwined with his ADHD. So don't be downhearted. I'm sure you have a lot to offer, and life will get easier once you work out how to manage your time and workload, so that you can achieve the things you want to achieve. Didn't find out I enjoy dancing until now, I am a 23 year old dude. Where do I go from here? I am 17, I aim to earn 50Lakh INR in 6 years from now. Is this goal realistic? If yes, how do I go ahead? Is education the only way to go abroad? Am I trapped here? I am being blamed for something I haven't done. How do I fix it? How do I stop people from believing I am lying? I score low GPA and now I am stuck with an average job. Where do I go from here? Don't put yourself in a box. \u201cI'm a environmentalist\u201d or \u201cI have adhd\u201d. Everyone has aspects of the same \u201cboxes\u201d just to different degrees. Be open to everything and use your head to make the best decision with what's in front of you. This is not a curse. You are able to see more of what\u2019s going on that most. It\u2019s tough when you\u2019re in school and forced to sit still for hours and hours. If you can, ask if you can have a break to stretch, to move around - that will help immensely. In France and other countries, some people sip a little (not even a cup) of coffee, which is a stimulant. In an inverse way, a bit of a stimulant calms you down. There are so many creatives who have some degree of ADD. When you\u2019re out of school this will serve you well. You need to be as physically active as possible to burn some of this off.

Majapahit empire management was very different with the european where territory boundaries means everything. In southeast asia at that time the system in used was  Mandala , where influence was everything. Like many other great power at that time, Majapahit also went here and there subjugating other kingdom to submit to their will by military power. The difference was that Majapahit did not integrate the subjugated kingdom directly, but rather through influence. They will put a puppet king and subject them to pay tribute and to send men and supply for war whenever Majapahit calls for it.

Under the \u201cStatute of Frauds,\u201d all real estate contracts are required to be in writing in order to be enforceable. Real estate contract - Wikipedia How can I be a great real estate negotiator to close contracts? What is a listing contract in real estate? What is an absentee owner in real estate, and what are some examples? Is there such a thing as a forward contract on a real estate property? What is a good example of a real estate contract? An \"implied\" contract in real estate is like any other implied contract - it's created by the actions of the parties rather than by a written document. If one ACTS like the agent for another person, it can reasonably be an IMPLICATION the person IS the agent for that other person. The most common circumstance in real estate occurs between a  real estate agent  and either a seller or a buyer. If a real estate agent reasonably appears to be ACTING on behalf of a seller or a buyer, by doing things and saying things that a seller's or buyer's agent would normally do (e.g. Advertise a seller's property) or say (e.g. \"Don't worry - I'll negotiate a good price for you) - even without having a written employment agreement, the real estate agent may reasonably be considered to be IMPLYING they are the agent of that seller or buyer. Consequently, the agent may reasonably be held to the legal and ethical standards that seller or buyer is entitled to. Hope this helps. Only one I can think of is peaceful or quiet enjoyment. That is that a tenant is allowed the peaceful use of the property so long as they don\u2019t violate other\u2019s enjoyment. As Bruce says a typical contract in real estate has to be written. However in the case of peaceful enjoyment courts have read that in to real estate contracts even if it isn\u2019t in the actual document. It typically comes up when the landlord appears to be intentionally harassing the tenant in order to get them to leave, or is being otherwise weird or creepy(the male apartment manager going into single women\u2019s apartments for no discern-able reason). Most decently crafted leases will include all common law or state law issues that could be implied contracts since that simplifies things. This usually happens with buyers because sellers sign a listing agreement, but many buyers don't sign a representation agreement. If you show a buyer several houses, you generally have implied agency.",

I know he/she would appreciate a hand-written note from you saying how much you enjoyed his/her class, and perhaps recalling something especially nice he/she did for you. If you want to include a small token gift, maybe choose a gift card to Star Bucks or a small bouquet of flowers. Teachers. Love. Gifts. If you want to show your appreciation to your teacher who's leaving, get them a nice little gift basket. Chocolates, a coffee mug, that kind of stuff. When you give them the basket, sit down and thank them for everything they've done. They'll appreciate it and it's not going too overboard. A book for the classroom library is a great way to say goodbye to a grade school teacher. Put your name in the book, with a simple inscription, (no address or phone number) and give it to the teacher on your last day of school. This act does a couple of things, it acknowledges your feeling for the teacher and benefits her/his classroom for years to come.",

        "a": "Here is the context for my question: In 2006, two men from India were fishing off of the coast of North Sentinel Island, a tiny outcrop in the Indian Ocean. That island is home to Sentinelese, an indigenous people of about 250 to 500 people who have had virtually no contact with civilization: they are essentially a stone-age people, perhaps the last group of \u201cuncontacted\u201d people on Earth. The two Indian fishermen accidentally drifted close to the island when their anchor failed. A group of Sentinelese came out of the forest and killed them with bows and arrows. Should the Indian government investigate the death of the fishermen as murder? Should they attempt to find the killers and bring them back to India to face justice? What's so thrilling for serial killers to murder? If one kills an alien can he be charged with murder? If police break into a killer's house without a warrant and find every piece of evidence pertaining to a murder, can that person be charged? Which would be worse your child being murdered by a serial killer or your child being the serial killer? Are there actual psychological murders? There are many places all over the world, mainly sensitive military installations, but also the homes of private citizens in some US states, where trespassers can legally be shot and killed. Well, it seems that this is the case of the Andaman islands under sentinelese law, or its equivalent. The situation has actually nothing to do with the fact that the tribe is uncontacted. Sentinel island is de-facto \u201cself-governed\u201d area. Indian government may have taken area under its protection, but de-facto islanders govern themselves. Their island, their rules. And their rules seem to contain \u201ckill all unwanted foreigners\u201d. You want to hold people who had no idea that the government or laws even existed to be held accountable for breaking those laws? It\u2019s one thing to claim ignorance of laws but when a tribe doesn\u2019t even know the outside world exists that is a whole different thing. Nope. These people were literally an island unto themselves so their reaction to the invaders was appropriate by their standards. If they were connected to and aware of the outside world and it\u2019s laws against killing then you would have a case for trial but in this instance you are dealing with primitives who are outside the common order of humanity.",

The number of free transactions in a month for a SBI savings bank account customer depends on the monthly average balance maintained during previous month. You may refer the image above or this  link . If the MAB maintained during previous month is less than \u20b91000/- then you can do only 5 transactions (whether financial or non-financial) from State Bank Group ATM machines. Also 3 times from other Bank\u2019s ATM machines if you are in any of the 6 RBI notified metros viz. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bengaluru or 5 times from other bank\u2019s ATM if you are using ATM in a place other than aforementioned metros. Apart from these 8/10 transactions at you are also eligible for 2 free cash withdrawal transactions at branch also. Similar limit is there if the previous MAB was above \u20b91000/- but less than \u20b925000/-. But the number of free transactions on Internet Banking increases from 20 to 40. If the MAB was above \u20b925000/- then there is no limit on number of transactions at State Bank Group ATM Machines. But at other bank\u2019s ATM it is same 3 or 5 depending on place. Now if MAB was above \u20b91,00,000/- then you can withdraw cash from branch, State Bank ATM, Other bank\u2019s ATM any number of times without any charge. Now, if you read the very last paragraph in the image it says about interchangeability which means even if the MAB on your account was less than \u20b925000/- and if you don't withdraw cash from branch and also not from any other bank\u2019s ATM machine then you can perform transactions (whether cash or non-cash) a total of (2+3+5=) 10 times at State Bank Group ATM in a month without any cost at 6 metros and a total of (2+5+5=) 12 times at other centres. This interchangeability is not known to most of people and sometimes even staff members. Now coming to limit on transactions wef  1st june 2017 , these limitations are applicable only I repeat only to cash withdrawal from your SBI BUDDY WALLET at SBG ATMs or if you have basic savings bank account (BSBD) which are another name for No-frills Accounts or Jandhan Accounts. So if you have normal Savings Bank Account then you need not worry about these limitations. Reagrds, Your own banker. How can I generate PIN for my new SBI debit card? How much money I can withdraw from an SBI ATM with an SBI card? Where can I get an SBI debit card one-time password (OTP)? How much money can I withdraw from an SBI ATM per day and per month? Someone used my SBI debit card information to shop at Amazon. How can I get my money back? There is no limit for withdrawal from a Debit Card at all. Only limit is How Many transactions are Free? And post how many transactions the Paid Withdrawal will apply for. It should not be considered as Penalty. Rather its a cost for the withdrawal of the money from the ATM> And the cost comprises of the cash handling charges, security, maintenance etc. As per the last read notification of SBI, upto 5 Withdrawals are free of cost. Post that for each withdrawal there shall be cost of Rs. 10 + Service Tax. Please note: In this current Chaos of the rules/policy change from the central bank, the above said limit & charges should be verified on its own by the customers.",

Or, at least, we attempt to see. I find that the beauty in things is not just knowing of their existence, but understanding exactly  how  they work too. You see this galaxy right here? Looks amazing, doesn\u2019t it. You could probably use it as wallpaper. Did you know, however, that magnetic field lines  guide where the spirals are ? I\u2019m serious. Normal magnets, but \u2018buffed\u2019 to the strength of galactic field lines, shape each galaxy in its own unique way. Now that you\u2019ve understood that, don\u2019t you feel excited? Can\u2019t you see another layer to this image? The field lines of the magnet, running parallel to the large, sweeping arms of the galaxy, guiding the birth of newborn stars, channelling gas into stellar nurseries. You see our Sun right here? It\u2019s one of countless stars in our Milky Way galaxy. We can feel its heat, the energy it gives us on Earth - it provides the sustenance for life! The feeling of the sun shining on your face is amazing. Did you know, though, that the sun is powered by  nuclear fusion?  In the core, the pressures and temperatures are so great that isotopes of hydrogen fuse together to make helium, releasing quite a bit of energy in the process. This makes photons, which bounce around in the interior of the sun until, someday, possibly after thousands of years, they make it to the surface. Then, the travel through the emptiness of space. And a tiny, tiny fraction of them manage to intersect the Earth\u2019s orbit. And a tiny fraction of them manage to get into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. And a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of them are absorbed on your face. Can you not see how this image comes alive? The core of the sun, always alive, always fusing atoms together. Don\u2019t you see how the shining rays of photons from the sun are but a small part of what\u2019s  really  happening? Does that not  fascinate you Sometimes, out at night, I look at the night sky: I am always  so disappointed  at how few stars I see in my area of the world. Screw you, artificial lighting! (Just kidding). I don\u2019t need light produced by one lightbulb - I want to see the light produced by  millions , probably  billions  of stars within galaxies, all fusing atoms in their cores, all producing energy, guided by the magnetic field lines of galaxies. A tiny, tiny fraction of the protons from all those stars manage to reach Earth, manage to reach my eye, and I see them. Little pinpricks of light, illuminating a vast cosmos. Yet, though each of them may be tiny points, I can see the entire structure of it all, the atoms arranged in molecules, into matter, into solar systems, into galaxies, into groups, clusters, superclusters\u2026 I do not see the universe with my eyes - I try to understand it with my brain. But what I understand is far more beautiful than what I will ever see. Space is huge.",

        "a": "What do you make of the ancient pyramids? Are they more than we thought? The ancients knew things that we don't. No one denies that, it's one reason that anthropologists are so adamant about keeping cultures from dying out or being forgotten. I have read that ancient civilizations could move and lift stone blocks that weighed 200 tons. We know they did it, we have the evidence, but no one quite knows HOW they did it. So one can look at this a couple of ways. One is that we can say that because such structures exist, that is proof that they were built by humans, who obviously knew how to do so. The other is to say that because there are things about these monuments that we don't understand, we can't say with certainty that they don't contain secrets with far-reaching implications. I much prefer option two, it makes for a far more interesting life. And to call the great pyramids just piles of rocks in no way accurately describes the science, effort, wisdom, culture, and lost knowledge that was required to build them into monuments that could be seen gleaming across the desert for many miles, and leave them standing for longer than any known human structure. I am especially taken with the theory that they were meant as earthly representations of the 3-star constellation of Orion's belt. Orion correlation theory - Wikipedia So yes, they are much more than some think. Cheers. What are some less known facts about pyramids? Are the Pyramids at Giza a hoax? Is it possible that ancient humans dating back 100,000 years or more were far more technologically advanced than previously thought, but all e... Why is Egypt more famous for its pyramids when Sudan has more? How was the ancient India during the time period when Pyramids were constructed in Egypt? By \u201cmore than we thought,\u201d do you mean \u201cmagical, signs of alien contact, or otherwise related to capabilities we lack\u201d? Then no. The dirty little secret here is that pyramids are  easy . That\u2019s why they show up all over the world. If you pile up a bunch of stuff, it\u2019ll naturally take on a triangular cross section. Try it yourself: get a big handful of sand or salt or something, and let a stream of it trickle from between your fingers, trying to keep it aimed at a single spot. It\u2019ll take on a sort of conical shape as it piles up. Square that off (pretty much every urbanized society switched from round to rectangular architecture), and you get a pyramid. So if you\u2019re a technologically unsophisticated society and you want to build a huge monument for the ages, piling up a bunch of rock and/or dirt and ending up with something pyramid-like is the easiest, most natural way of doing so. That\u2019s why we find pyramids and pyramid-like structures in Africa (not just Egypt; they\u2019re found in other societies down the Nile), Mesopotamia, the Americas from Peru to Cahokia, China, and elsewhere. Pyramid-building isn\u2019t inevitable, but it appears to be high on the list of logical choices for monument building for early civilizations. There are about 2.2 million blocks of rock, and it was built in 20 years like they say, that means that they had to put a new piece every two and half minutes 24/7. Their average weight is 2.5 tons. There are only three believable theories. It was built by some higher intelligence and technology people (creatures) from some place else, or They used high sound waves that repealed the gravity and levitated the rocks into their right place. Or The building blocks were cast on the spot; made of extremely hardening concrete with some unknown ingredients. I don\u2019t believe jews or Egyptians built it with bare hands. Besides, the pyramid is full of amazing mathematical proportions like Pi, Pythagorean theorem, Phi and many others. See my detailed account in another answer, here: If you know the metric system, here\u2019s something to think about. All these are facts: The Great Pyramid location 29.9792 N is exactly the same as speed of light 299, 792 km/sec. You might say that this is a coincidence, but wait\u2026. The height is 146.6 meters. The top is flat which would add 3 metres to the peak. 149.6 million km is average distance between earth and sun. Take the base length, each side is 230.8 metres. If you take two base lengths and divide by the height 146.6 you get Pi (3.14159) even though Pi was discovered in the west 2000 years later. The mass is about 5.97 million tonnes vs, the mass of earth 5.972 x 10 (to 18th power) tonnes. Again, all these are coincidences\u2026.? Egyptians had also their own measuring stick, holy cubit (Cubit was shorter), which was 63, 57 cm. At Egypt level the radius of earth is 6357 km or ten million cubits. If you turn the base length into holy cubits you get 365. 2425 which is an exact solar year at their latitude. There\u2019s also the belt of Orion which was at that time an exact mirror image of the three Giza pyramid layout, Stars Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka. Holy cubit was 25 Egyptian inches (very close to an US inch). The inner dimensions of king\u2019s chamber are 309 - 421 - 515 Eg. inches. If you put these in the Pythagorean triangle they fit exactly. The biggest rock in the pyramid weighs 70 tons. It\u2019s dimensions are 093 - 124 - 155 inches. They are the same numbers in scrambled order and still fit the Pythagorean theorem exactly. Not to speak about it\u2019s alignment towards the true north, references to the Bible and many others. So, did Egyptians know all this or did someone, maybe from Orion, help them? I'm quite sure they are more than what we thought about them yet, I can't figure out why they built it and what is the use of it, and how they used it? Its amazing size and accuracy, engineering and technology that is used. Keep in mind that it is not a tomb, and they spent a fortune on building it and took them tens of years to complete it, and their sons kept the tradition for god knows why. This leaves the mystery unsolved and the guessing open to all expectations and thoughts? Does it meant to be connection to outer space? Does it meant to be some energy generator? Does it meant to be a mass healing? I lived in Ancient Egypt in 5 past lives but I don\u2019t recall anything about the pyramids. But I do know that there were no slaves. There were Jewish workers but they had been contracted. Some of their elders had agreed with one of the Pharaohs to contract them for many generations to work for the Pharaohs in exchange for safe haven and protection. There were good relations between the Egyptians and the Jewish people but they became bound by this contract and later generations were not happy about it.They wanted to be released from the contract that they had been placed under by their ancestor elders. However I don\u2019t believe that any of them had anything to do with building pyramids. What do I think now? I have seen many experts talk about them in documentaries and the message seems to be that they cannot be built today even with the modern building equipment that we have and certainly not in two decades as the Great Pyramid was built. So I doubt very much that the Egyptians built them. However the Egyptians did use them. I think that they were built by aliens from a world in the star system of Alpha Centauri. This is a very advanced and very spiritual civilization, who have had a long interest in what happens on Earth. It would not surprise me if the pyramids contain a teleport system to their world but I doubt that we could open it or use it.",

There has never been a successful invasion of Britain since then. So for the US to win would be nearly impossible. The only way to win would be to initiate a cold war where we are hopelessly outspent. We'd be fine. I think that maybe we would attack precious US reserves of oil such as in Alaska, form a trade deal with Russia and starve the US of trades, with 90% of countries not dealing with it. We would then negotiate and take a favourable deal. If Russia attacked us , we couldn't lose. They are deprived of money and trade already. The USA would be itching to help us and the EU would also declare war. The only issue is that there might not be much of a eurovision 2018 because all the mini Russian border nations would be temporarily swallowed. They would eventually run out of money, we would replace Putin and probably give the border states more land. The only faction that poses a problem is the EU.

The idea that we get to marry pure pristine people is pure bunk. As many as a quarter of the women you've dated, statistically, have been sex workers at some point in their lives (or will be at some point in the future.) We don't get to live in a fairy tale. This is reality and people have faults. All of them. Not necessarily this fault, but still. I have no idea how you learned of this. If she told you, all I can say is wow. God bless that honesty. So you need to look at specifics, or not, depending on how you feel about this particular thing. How long ago did it happen, what were the ages, what were the circumstances, this stuff all affects the calculus but in my crazy opinion, well, i would actually say that  might not  be a deal breaker. It's a hell of a skeleton to have in one\u2019s closet, I'll give you that, but if it were up to me, depending on the circumstances, I'd be able to look past it. Should I marry a girl for her looks? Or let her marry me for my looks? How should physical attractiveness affect long term romantic relationsh... Will an Indian guy marry a girl after knowing that she had physical relation with her ex bf ? Should I marry a girl even though I am not physically attracted to her? Should you marry a girl who had a boyfriend in the past ? My mother is sick. My relatives are suggesting I should get married to a girl who will take care of her. Should I do it? Is she having them now? Has she gone behind your back and cheated on you with her brother? Does she intend to break the rules of your relationship and have physical relations with him again? If not, who cares? Have you been on the internet ever? This is not an unusual thing. Brothers and sisters, same-sex siblings, parents and grown children, these are some pretty massive porn categories. And yeah, not my thing.  But \u2026 As long as they're not making inbred, possibly sick babies, who cares? So she and her brother got curious once. And? How many straight men have gotten curious with male friends? Does that mean they get kicked out of the straight man club forever? Sex, and our physical and psychological reaction to it, is extremely complex. It's normal to be curious, about things we often see as weird or depraved. You can either repress it or go with it. Take a guess which option psychologists recommend. She got curious. She's allowed to be curious. It likely means she's more open-minded and adventurous than you. You could potentially benefit from being in a relationship with her. Had physical relations as in sex with her own brother? Was she raped by her brother? That's not her fault then is it? However if she voluntarily had sex with her brother then sounds like she has boundary issues. Should you marry someone who has sexual boundary issues even with their own flesh and blood? Family is pretty big deal. Most of us know that we don't have sexual relations with our own parents and siblings. To cross sexual boundaries with family is a major no-no. How can you trust her to respect sexual boundaries with your own family and your future children with her should you marry her? Dude run!!! This wouldn't be received well if a woman asked should she marry a man who had sexual intercourse with his own sister? You need to read the Bible. The Bible talks about incest all of the time. When sinners committed this crime, none of them are seriously happy. They are frickin\u2019 miserable. I am using a euphemism. Please find someone else.",

        "a": "Although one could cast a supervised learning problem as a reinforcement learning problem, that is generally a bad idea, and you cannot always do the inverse. So generally speaking, the model you should use depends on which problem you\u2019re trying to solve: is it a supervised learning problem or strictly a reinforcement learning problem? If you\u2019re not sure how to tell the difference between the problems here\u2019s a rule of thumb. If you have data expressing what the answer should be for various examples, you have a supervised learning problem and should use methods designed for supervised learning. For example if we\u2019re trying to predict whether someone has brain cancer and we\u2019re given a bunch of brain scan images that are labeled as being either of a brain with cancer or a brain with out cancer, we have a supervised learning problem, because we\u2019re told what the answer should be for each example brain scan. Reinforcement learning is generally concerned with problems in which you need to learn which actions an agent ought to take in an environment to maximize some temporal aggregation of reward the agent will receive after each action it takes. Think of a rat trying to get to the cheese at the end of a maze. The rat isn\u2019t given data about which action it should take at a bunch of different places in the maze (that would be supervised learning). Instead it has to try different actions and the result of most actions will not reveal whether that action was ultimately a good idea or not until later, because most of the time, the rat cannot see the cheese. Once the rat finds the cheese, it then has to figure out which actions in its past were the important actions to to lead to that positive event. Moreover, if the rat ever makes a bad decision during it\u2019s learning, it has to live with the consequences (there is no ctrl-z in life). We can also make the problem even harder for the rat. Maybe to get to the cheese the rat has to go through a region that gives a minor, but uncomfortable, shock to it. When the rat first enters such a region of the maze, it might feel motivated to turn around since it was uncomfortable. However, if it sticks with that uncomfortable path, it will eventually find the much more rewarding cheese that compensates for the minor discomfort it had to experience to get there. So which models you use depends on which of those types of problems you\u2019re trying to solve. Special case : There is another case in which we do provide an algorithm data, rather than forcing it to interact with the environment, but it\u2019s still reinforcement learning. That is, suppose we had a rat with a camera on its head exploring the maze. Then we wanted to give this camera footage to another rat for it to learn from (obviously rats don\u2019t typically learn by watching TV, but lets pretend they could :) ). Although we provided the new rat data to use, that data doesn\u2019t tell the rat which action it should have taken at each moment. Without that explicit information, it\u2019s not a supervised learning problem. Instead the new rat still has to piece together from everything it observes in that video which actions in which places would ultimately lead to the cheese, causing it to be a reinforcement learning problem. Specifically, it would be what is called an offline off-policy reinforcement learning problem.",

Every time the phone rings and it isn\u2019t a scheduled call that we are waiting for, it is likely to be abrupt. We get them all the time. As for rudeness, there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all definition of what constitutes rudeness. If you contact her and request that she provide a referral for you, she may very well consider it to be rude. After all, you contacted her out of the blue and asked her to do something for you without rebuilding the relationship. A better approach may be to contact her as planned with a bit of a difference. You may have to reintroduce yourself and the context of where you worked together. Once that is out of the way you can introduce the subject that you have applied for a job at the health unit she works at. Instead of leading with asking for her to provide a reference for you, you would be better to see if she will share some \u2018inside\u2019 goodies with you. What\u2019s it like to work there? What is the manager like? Did she know anything about the interview process or the type of questions that they were likely to ask? If you hit it off again, as you did in the past, perhaps she can become an internal cheerleader for you. It\u2019s not quite the same as asking her to refer you but it can actually have more impact. Assuming that she has some influence with those that are doing the hiring. Since you worked on a project together and not necessarily together in a workplace, she can only likely promote your so-called \u2018soft skills.\u2019 You are going to have to back it up with a solid resume.

        "a": "Probably about the same level (meaning not very). American\u2019s aren\u2019t afraid of Russians. We (the country and the government) have reasonable concerns about the near and long term aims of the Russian government. However, barring some idiocy that the current leader in Russia probably isn\u2019t going to commit (like making a move on the rest of Ukraine, which would freak the hell out of the Polish government, or attempting to take the Baltic states by force), there will be no military confrontation between our two nations in Europe. Which is a very good thing for the world, and especially for Russians, as such a conflict would last 2\u20133 years at most, and end with most of Russia west of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and north of St Petersburg as well as the entire Russian half of that Peninsula in the north becoming occupied territory and then a DMZ similar to the one between N. and S. Korea. That\u2019s the good news. The Russian and European economies would tank further, with Russia being the hardest hit (oil exports to Europe being the primary source of income flowing into the country). It would also be likely that Russia would lose the most valuable parts of eastern Siberia to China if they took advantage of the war with NATO to jump north and seize territory that would be very useful to them (the oil and natural gas deposits). Russia would be unable to defend those fields, or hold ground having diverted many of the far-east military units to the war in Europe (they\u2019d have no choice but to do this as attrition wore down their units in Europe). The bottom line is that it\u2019s not a good idea to get into a fight with half the world, and a very BAD idea to do it if you\u2019re physically attached to the people you\u2019ll be fighting against with the most powerful foe NOT being within your striking range for any meaningful purposes. The leaders in the Russian government know and understand this. The way modern war is fought, the only countries on the planet that could hope to not be crushed quickly being on the receiving end of such a scenario are the US and Canada - due to the size and dispersion of facilities/infrastructure in both countries and even more importantly due to the geographic isolation from Europe and Asia. Why are people afraid of a powerful China but not a powerful US? Have the Russians at anytime in the world's history, been afraid of the U.S.? Why is Donald Trump so afraid of China? Of whom should be U.S.A. more afraid? Russia or China? Are Russia and the US enemies? Reading Quora Americans seem to be scared of more or less everyone and everything . Their own shadow for a start. Oh we need more guns to protect ourselves from somebody Oh we need bigger bombs to protect ourselves from another country All the idiots storing away stuff in case, well in case of anything \u2026. BOOO! Scared that satan is coming Scared that Jesus is going to make his long over due return (gonna have to wait hell of a long time for that one) Scared of naked human bodies on television Scared of atheists, scared of Muslims, Mexicans, Canadians, Cubans, Commies, the bogey man Scared of science Having said that all the Americans, I have met have being very nice. (big teeth tho and they smell, do they ever shower?) I\u2019m not afraid of any country in the world, and I\u2019m American. I\u2019m not sure that Americans and Russian are really afraid of each other. I have had contact with many Russians, and I didn\u2019t experience that they were afraid of Americans, nor do I believe that most Americans are afraid of Russians. There has been a huge amount of media propaganda lately, but this is not the 1950s. In the past such propaganda was more effective than it is today. People now have Internet, and access to more information than in previous years. Therefore the propaganda against various countries is less effective than in the past. You do not have enough paper to list all the fears mentioned by current press entertainers in public here since 1941. Not a university here lacks curriculum courses for years and years in any language you want to study for a profession from a professional Source (each one). The Russians I met at Indian University Bloomington were the T.A.-graders for those in the beginning 101 Course. SHE was not afraid of us at all.

So far they have an engine and a prototype chassis but there\u2019s no evidence that there is a working example that has actually been driven, and no plans to put the car into production.

Will the Devel Sixteen ever go into production? What is the fastest land mammal? What is the top speed of the fastest car in the world? Which are the most fastest car of 2016 in the world? No. It\u2019s still the Thrust SSC at Mach 1.020 (1,227.985 km/h / 763.035 mi/h). It was the first car to break the sound barrier and, to the best of my knowledge, the last.

No. For the simple fact that it claims to do those speeds, but has never proven to do so. 5000 hp from a V16? Yeah right. The old Veyron had a W16 and could barely manage 1000 hp.

        "a": "Noone online will be able to help you 100% as many components can cause this engine behaviour when they are faulty. The first place I would look for a problem on a vehicle with those symptoms would be the idle-air(or idle-speed) control valve. A quick fix is to remove it, submerge(or fill) the sticking valve in penetrating fluid (like WD) (and/or clean it) for a day or so and cross your fingers it works when you put it back on. Or replace it. Without being there and with so little information IDK. A good workshop manual for your car will have detailed fault finding tables to help amateur and professional diagnosis. An OBD II reader may immediately diagnose the problem correctly. A reputable garage will do that for you, though. A (Ford) main dealer may do it quicker, for likely more expense. But as I said earlier, the root cause of this fault can be caused by the failure of one or several things which are not always immediately recognisable. Trial and error may be the only solution\u2026  If you do it yourself, use new parts\u2026 IMO Do diesel engines need to idle, or should they be shut off after a couple of minutes? What causes a car to have a low idle at a stop? Why is the heater in my Ford Taurus not working? What is it like to drive a Ford Taurus? Where is the fuse box on a 2003 Ford Taurus? There are several entities which affect idle and therefore multiple reasons any car could have an issue with inconsistent idle and or dying. Typically, when you are just guessing, you fix the cheapest thing first. Or better yet, now that the internet has some documentation for nearly everything - research what remedies there are for a particular issue for the vehicle and a few years difference for a make and model may not change whether a remedy works or not, as most manufactures do not change everything on their car, every year. For a Ford Taurus (in the 2000s) with an idle problem - there are many references to the idle air control online. But, checking a couple of youtube vids, there is also a vacuum line (the vacuum line attached to the pcv valve) which can get melted or split. So, check the vacuum lines, if one is split, cracked or melted, replace, then check idle. Clean the pcv valve (use carburetor or throttle body cleaner), check idle (if that fixes it, then replace the pcv valve). Clean the idle air control (use carburetor or throttle body cleaner), check idle (if that fixes it, then replace the iac valve). If that doesnt fix it, go in order of cheapest other possible culprits of the rough idle. A common problem on these cars is the air idle control valve going bad. This can result in stalling, rough idle, and hard starts. Other issues could include vacuum leaks, poor fuel pressure, and ignition issues. Try to pull any codes with an OBDII reader. If you can't, start diagnosing the easy things first and eliminating possibilities. Without being there, the number one cause on that car with a 3.0 Vulcan motor, is that the vacuum line adapter on the passenger side top of the intake manifold cracks and creates a vacuum leak. If its bad, it should be hissing or whooshing while its running. The second most likely cause is the idle air control motor going out. Both conditions can exist at the same time. Go to your friendly local parts store where they will probably read the code(s) for free -ask them- and take it from there.\u00a0 Modern vehicles are seriously complicated and the Engine Control Unit does many things, including logging fault codes.",

        "a": "Hi, Both marketing strategy is awesome with different points. The main difference between Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Pay Per Click (PPC) is that traffic coming from SEO (organic) is free while traffic generated from PPC is not free (as the name implies you have to pay a cost per click). Position in Search Results Where exactly your ad will appear depends on a number of factors (i.e. the keywords you are targeting, keywords in your ad copy, keywords in your landing page and many more) but it\u2019s either on top or below the organic results. Cost I have mentioned above that SEO traffic is free and PPC is paid and while this is absolutely true, you should understand that it needs a lot of effort and hard work to get free traffic from search engines. Traffic potential Which method can bring more traffic to your web site, SEO or PPC? SEO (organic traffic) is more than PPC traffic so if you can manage to rank your web site for the keywords you want, you will get much more traffic than paying for those keywords. Conversion Which visitor is more likely to convert (i.e. make a purchase, register to a newsletter and in general response to call for action), someone coming from PPC Ads or from organic search? Ease of use Neither SEO nor PPC is anything but difficult to do on the off chance that you don't have the important information and experience. SEO is a procedure that takes a great deal of time and exertion. It might take months or even years to rank for particular terms or not rank by any stretch of the imagination! On the off chance that you are new to SEO, investigate our complete SEO Tutorial to get a thought of what really matters to SEO. On the hand, keeping in mind the end goal to get some great outcomes with PPC and Adwords you either need to take a course or contract a PPC master to help you or you will lose a couple of hundred dollars before you see how it functions. How is content marketing related to SEO strategy? Which is the one to choose, SEO marketing or PPC marketing? What is the best SEO strategy right now? What is the hardest part of being a PPC marketer? What skills, such as SEO, PPC, etc. does a digital marketing expert need? For a business both are important. Both channels has its merits and demerits. So am gonna list the pros and cons of each on different benefits so you can choose based on your objectives. Cost: PPC means paid advertisement so obviously you ll have to spend money. But that doesn't meant there is no cost involved on SEO. Content, promotion and resources for SEO does cost you. But on the long term SEO costs will be less once your website gains rankings. And PPC typically gonna cost you more as competition increases. ROI : From above point, it is easier to understand that for SEO short term ROI will be low but on long-term it ll be high. PPC ROI is defined based on optimization. Long Term Benefits: SEO helps in long term brand awareness and sales but PPC more based on short term sales/objectives. Businesses focusing on immediate sales should adopt PPC than SEO. Efforts: Both requires continuous & long term benefits. Targeting: PPC more of very focused and niche targeting but SEO opens up the targeting based on the content created. Scaling up: Easier to scale up PPC campaigns based on budget and market available. But scaling SEO takes time. So in short, PPC can be used to meet short term objectives where as SEO is to set up long term stable revenue source. It totally depends on the goal and vision. In order to grow your business and take things to the next level, I would recommend you to invest on both. However, here are some cases to take a look at: If you already have good online presence and just want to generate more leads and eventually sales, then PPC is the right choice! If you are already making good business through PPC but lacks the online presence, then invest on SEO as it will help you reduce your PPC investment. If you are a startup then invest 60% on SEO and 40% on PPC as it will help you maintaining the leads and presence balance. For a successful business both PPC and SEO are equally important. However, I would like to change the comparison from SEO vs PPC to Organic Vs Inorganic. Because, SEO alone can\u2019t do much, you need to put equal efforts on social media and content marketing for the best results.",

        "a": "Because women and children were a drain on society\u2019s resources. In civilizations with economies based on agriculture or industry, a strict division of labor along gender lines emerged. That's because men can't get pregnant and there was no such thing as baby formula, time-saving appliances, or fast food. Or birth control. Men left home to go to work in fields and factories, and came back home with the bacon. Women stayed home and nursed babies, cooked the food, and cleaned the house. In other words, women contributed nothing to the family\u2019s economic coffers. On the contrary, they and their children were a drain on the family\u2019s financial resources. What man in his right mind is going to be okay with spending his hard-earned money on children that aren\u2019t his? Therefore, women\u2019s sexuality needed to be strictly controlled. And by extension, so did men\u2019s, though to a lesser degree. A man who impregnated a woman to whom he had not bound himself to support economically through marriage would be severely punished by the family of the impregnated woman, and by society at large. All of this is why there were (and still are) dowries. If a woman is useless economically, and in fact is a drain on resources, then a father has to bribe a man to take her off his hands. Women are still suffering the ramifications of these economic systems to this day. Cultural attitudes become deeply ingrained over millennia and can't be completely changed in a mere fifty years. By the way, all of this applies much less in hunter-gatherer societies, where the woman might provide as much as 80% of the family\u2019s sustenance through her gathering activities. She just straps the baby on her back, goes out with the ther women, and collects the food and other resources in a few hours work. And because of her contributions, she is more highly valued in her society, and her sexuality is not nearly as restricted. Have you ever had sex with a complete stranger? What's your story? What is the minimum penis size needed to achieve penetrative sex? What does it feel like to receive oral sex? What are all the sex positions? How many times can a women have sex in one day? Why is sex so condemned although everyone is in constant need of it? Because religious rules were chosen to be almost unsatisfiable. That makes perfect sense from the perspective of a priest. If you want to keep your job, you need people in need of your help, in need of revelation. That means you need sinners but that is an easily solved problem if you can define yourself what is a sin. You simply define something people do by nature to be a sin and - voil\u00e0 - there you created yourself an inextinguishable supply of sinners. If that still does not suffice, you simply invent something not the people have done but what their long lost ancestors have done, e.g. eating an apple they should not have eaten and therefore having been thrown out of paradise, and call it original sin. Even better, now everyone is a sinner by birth and what they do becomes irrelevant. Sin is nothing but a priests\u2019 job security program. Sex as a sin is just a strategically valid choice for a sin. Not everyone is in constant need of it. There are asexual people, and there those who are unable to reflect on their desires and prefer to believe they just don\u2019t need it. Besides, what is meant by \u201csex is condemned\u201d? I would say what is condemned concerns: a) talking publically about one\u2019s sex life as it is believed to be private b) having too much sex as it is believed to devalue you as a person c) sex an as act of violence d) non-traditional consensual sex (anything, depending on the personal opinion of what \u201cnon-traditional\u201d is, which does not include c) ) This is all about sex, and many people are not sure where the borderline between the accepted and the unaccepted is. Even law regulations regarding these matters differ from country to country as they involve the role of sex in different cultures. Firstly, as c) exists, and sex can, indeed, be associated with violence and be seen as an act of taking control, this already makes people generalize and condemn sex as such. Secondly, like I said, there are cultural differences, and there are individual differences within one culture. This means there are social standards and expectations regarding this matter. The socio-cultural background has an immense effect on many people\u2019s thinking, and they adjust their mindset to the most popular view in their environment. This makes them condemn anything outside these expectations. Thirdly, many people are incapable to evaluate the context. Sex is just sex. What makes it appropriate or inappropriate depends on the situation, in which it occurs, and the participants. Whether it is appropriate to talk about it also depends on the context. Something should be kept private, and something is okay to discuss, but how to know the difference? It is easier to condemn everything related to this. Finally, there is gender inequality (or, I\u2019d rather say - differences) regarding what is accepted for women, and what - for men (like having many partners), and for the time being it is not likely to be changed. This causes a lot of tension as this view is constantly being challenged. There are a few reasons I can come up with. Sex is in general associated with so many problems, in relationships and mental and physical health, that many people would like to deprioritize it in their lives. Those who don\u2019t share their viewpoints become obstacles to that reality. Attractiveness is hard to change and many people feel that we should judge others based on traits that they cannot change. One way to do that is by discouraging sex since it often centers on attractiveness. There are differences in the psychology of sex between genders and that\u2019s led to some clashes between them. Many people actually experience a sense of disgust from the sexual practices of others, to the point that they take offense even simply knowing that they exist somewhere. Your premise is wrong. Everyone is not in constant need of sex. You will not die if you don\u2019t have sex. Plenty of people lead sex-less lives by choice.",

The quote you cited never said \u201clisten for hours.\u201d It just said \u201clisten.\u201d You are throwing your \u2014 presumably miserable \u2014 personal experience all over that perfectly neutral guidance to listen to your partner. Maybe you want to deal with your injuries at the hands of \u201cfemale egomaniacs\u201d before some nice woman who lets you know she is sad gets buried under your rage, when she just wanted a hug. Maybe you were injured; maybe not. But if you're in this much pain that you literally can't see straight enough to read your own quote, I suggest you consult a therapist or spiritual counselor. What is the wisest piece of advice a teacher has ever given you? What advice should be given to students who will be attending college for the first time? What is the best piece of advice given to you? How do I listen to my own advice? What advice would you like to give to Indian men? Not necessarily. Obviously it can be abused, especially if the woman acts like the man owes something to her, but she owes nothing in return. Men and women have different brains, and deals with problems and stress differently. A man doesn't talk about his problems to get sympathy: he talks about them to get help finding a solution. Women, however, have different brains. While men can compartmentalize their thoughts and think about specific things, women tend to think about lots of things at once, and with lots of emotion getting attached from one thing to another. Pretty soon this snowballs. They deal with this by talking about it. Not by talking WITH you so much as AT you. The only thing they usually want to hear from you is agreement, support, and/or sympathy. This seems both crazy and selfish to men, but it works. Conversely, men can choose to think about other things. They can even think about nothing! So they often deal with stress from their problems by simply engaging in a pleasant and mind numbing activity like watching tv or fishing. Or a hobby that gives a problem they can more easily solve and see instant results. And it works. When a woman sees this, she doesn't see a man doing exactly what he is supposed to. She's sees a WOMAN who is broken and needs to open up. So she tries to talk to the guy, which harms him instead of helping him. Likewise, when a woman comes to a man to talk about her problems, he thinks she wants help, because that's the only reason he can think of why she would be talking about it. So it is true that the advice givmen will help women. I think it's fine as long as you also give women the advice to leave men alone when they want to be alone. A guy enjoying a hobby by himself isn't him being lazy or depressed; it's him doing what you\u2019re doing by talking. Relieving stress. A Tale of Two Brains Huh? What? Listening to someone, even if it is for hours\u2026.is an exercise in basic human  empathy. Not to generalize, but most of the men I know tend to want to \u201cfix\u201d things. And we women sometimes\u2026want to talk, just get it out of our system. It is very therapeutic and those that have not experienced just talking about issues without the necessity of it turning into a brainstorming session for solutions, simply don\u2019t get it. This is why, men are often given this advice to turn off their \u201cproblem solving\u201d prowess and just be a kind ear. God, it is not some ploy by women to dominate the Earth and laugh maliciously at the bent out of shape males we leave behind in our quest for power and ego satisfaction. What a thing to believe! Not everything is a gender war, Not everything is about a tug-of-power, Not everything is about ego and pride of place, Not everything is designed to offend, oppress and demean. Holy Skittles! Sometimes, it is just good advice that people should take at face value. We are walking down a path to a culture that is  always  looking for a fight. Sometimes there\u2019s no fight, people\u2026there\u2019s just basic human decency. Hallelujah! Of course not. This is an exaggeration of the perfectly valid advice to men that they listen sympathetically to women rather than take women\u2019s need to express their problems as a request to fix them.

        "a": "You may not like this, but there isn't just a whole lot that you can do. First , I have to establish the difference between  strict  teacher and a  rude  teacher. While sometimes it may be hard to distinguish the two, you may be able to do something about the rude teacher. Now a strict teacher is most likely what you are talking about, a teacher who is curt and treats student with little respect. He/she might yell a lot or etc. to get students to obey. I used to have a teacher like this, I'll call her Mrs. Dececero. She would yell at us a lot and constantly got on kid\u2019s cases about super minor stuff. One time, we were doing a project were we had to event an object, and give \u201csales pitch\u201d to her. She said that you couldn't do anything that was already invented, and that  anyone  could look it up if the object had been invented. However this one kid came up with the idea of a fidget pen, or a pen with like switches and joysticks and stuff. But Mrs. Dececero found it online and took points off the kid's grade. These teachers may not be fun to have, but they are still doing their job. Now  rude  teachers are the kind that specifically call out and insult individual students and regularly disregard the feelings of student, and treat them with no respect. These are the teachers that do not deserve the degree they slaved for. Now, as a student you can't do a whole lot alone. Firstly I would tell everything to your parents, so they may schedule a parent-teacher meeting. If that fails, I would recommend talking to the principal or another administrator, but you have to get as many students as possible to get behind your cause. Get all the students affected to sign a paper or something and carefully and clearly lay out all the reasons you think the administrator should talk with the teacher. If all else fails, just recognize that your teacher is under as much stress as you, and means 0% of what they say, I garuntee they are just taking their frustrations on you for some reason. What are some of the best high school hacks you\u2019ve used? Who was the worst teacher or professor you've come across? How is the best way to deal with a son's middle school teacher? How do I deal with a rude teacher? How can I deal with a biased teacher who grades unfairly? If you are not dealing with a  strict teacher  then you have come to the right place. Whenever this happens, you should always avoid comebacks or any form of challenging what the teacher is saying (even if the teacher is telling you a lie). These teachers are normally refuse to accept common sense and only accept what they think to be right. They also require you to do certain things not because it is the right thing or because it benefits your education but because, and I am quoting one of my teachers, \u201cI SAID SO!!!!\u201d You have to sort of bow down to these teachers and do what they say even if it doesn\u2019t make sense. Kind of how you sometimes act towards your parents. If possible, then you should tell a teacher about this casually and tell them to do something like put their head to the door so that you can have proof. If it gets really bad, then you should file a formal complaint(or report them. These could mean the same thing) and tell the teacher for the evidence. In our middle school, there was this substitute that was extremely rude. Let\u2019s call her Mrs. Sally. She would cut people off in between a sentence when they were trying to tell her something that she was doing wrong. Usually no one would talk back to her. She would say, \u201cI know how to do things around here. I\u2019ve been working here for 27 years.\u201d One day, she was our substitute for the day. I raised my hand during the class and asked her \u201c Hey Mrs. Sally? I have a question for you. Just to get to know you better. What college did you go to?\u201d She hesitated a moment and wearily said \u201cKent State.\u201d My friend who sat next to me mumbled, \u201cCan\u2019t read, can\u2019t write, Kent State.\u201d She glared at my friend, \u201cWhat did you say young man. Can you say it a little louder?\u201d My friend sat up straight and said a little louder, \u201cCan\u2019t read, can\u2019t write, Kent State. Do you need me to say it again for you a little louder because I\u2019m pretty sure your old ears couldn\u2019t hear that.\u201d By this time, there were oooo\u2019s and ahhhh\u2019s in the classroom. The teacher looked around and signaled the classroom to be quiet. She said to my friend, \u201cYou say sorry to my friend right now or else\u2026 \u201d My friend unleashed his rage. \u201cOr else what. What could  you  possibly do to  me?  You\u2019re like 2 feet! You couldn\u2019t even reach the top of the 5 foot shelf to get the books that were needed for class today! You\u2019re as thin as a stick and  you  threaten me? What a scumbag you are.\u201d Mrs. Sally marched down the aisle to my friend, grabbed him by the sleeve, and dragged him to the office. The last thing I saw happen is my friend punching the teacher in the face. We didn\u2019t see her again. He must\u2019ve broken something. I don\u2019t know if this helps because I wasn\u2019t the one dealing with this teacher but I\u2019m just telling you, don\u2019t do this because I\u2019m pretty sure he got a suspension for 2 weeks. (Also, I\u2019m sorry offended any people that go to Kent State. Just want to apologize.) It depends on what you mean by rude. Usually, just let it go. Some people have a tendency to be brusque or sarcastic. If it\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s easy enough to endure for 45 minutes or so. Some sorts of rudeness cross a line though, and need to be reported. For instance, comments that are racist or that are targeted towards someone\u2019s religion or ethnicity are inappropriate.",

        "a": "Real Madrid usually play with 4\u20133\u20133 formation. 4 in defence, 3 in midfield, 2 wingers and one striker. So there are usually 3 players in midfield. Lets break down their roles to understand the way they defend. I am going to explain our first team tactics. Tactics obviouly change as players change. Kross Kross isn\u2019t really an attacking midfielder. He helps to attack better. In counter attacking football you need pin point quick passes. Kross is pass master and he also helps in nice build up play with remaining a bit deep in midfield and make accurate passes all over the field to players in key areas. He defends well, but not against good players. Especially in last clasico he hardly completed one tackle against messi. But he positions well while defending. Cutting down passing lanes. Modric He is a maestro. If you think he doesn\u2019t defend well you are wrong my friend. In current team defending just isn\u2019t his main role. He can create problems for any kind of attacking player. Casemiro He is a machine. He is a defender. He knows how to stand tackle. He knows how to slide tackle. An injury in current season damaged his form. But he is the one of the best weapons we have against players like messi. If he is in form, oponents can\u2019t score solo goals. You have to play amazing team game to break through. Bale I believe Bale plays an important part in defending. He started his career as a Left Back. He has got strength and big physicall presence. He usually defends deep with Carvajal. If he is playing on right flank with Carvajal as RB. It\u2019s not easy to break through our defence from left. Defenders You would have heared that Real concede goals. Thats not because we have weak defence. Thats usually because Ramos loves to move ahead of defending line and cut the passing lanes. That helps us to counter. With our acrobatic wing backs and solid CBs we really do well in defending consering the kind of game we play ( You might be thinking what kind of game). The answer is the kind of game in which every outfield player scores. Moreover Madrid likes the counter attacking brand of game, we have pacey players. So team pushes back while defending and break fast when we win the ball. Players like Benzena and Ronaldo try to win back the ball if we lose the posession while attacking. They keep moving to cut the passing lanes in around 3\u20134 meters of area around them. Hope I explained well. Thanks !! Who has a better midfield: Barca or Real Madrid? Is Benzema a good striker? Or is it the Real Madrid midfield and wings feeding him? Does Isco have any chance of regular football once the star midfielders are fit at Real Madrid? Is it right to play Modric & Kroos as the two midfielders considering that they can't win physical duels? Is Real Madrid missing someone like ... When someone says \"Real Madrid's midfield is deeper\", what does it mean? Real Madrid may only have the second-highest number of goals in Europe at the time of writing this, but they do have the most consitent attack. Every outfield player at Madrid has scored  and  assisted at least a goal, and the only one of them who has only assisted is Fabio Coentr\u00e3o. The whole team is a goal threat. When going forward, Real Madrid are the best in the world. On the other hand, they conced goals at an average that surpasses a goal every game. The host of attack-minded players that Real Madrid has cannot defend as well as Chelsea or Juventus will, with their established defensive players. Excluding Ronaldo, the team does not lack in defensive work rate. We have some of Europe\u2019s most hardworking players; they just don\u2019t have as much skill in defending as other teams. However, Real Madrid can get away with it because, during the majority of most matches, the opposition is more busy working to stop Real Madrid from scoring. There aren\u2019t too many opportunities to attack. When they do have an opportunity, the hard work of these attack-minded defenders is usually enough to see off the attacks, often resulting in a Real Madrid counter-attack. We are back at the starting point, and the opposition find themselves defending\u2026 It\u2019s a vicious cycle. Probably you have not seen Casemiro at his best. Yes, he does act. But the ugly work part is being perfectly done by Casemiro himself. You could clearly see Madrid's unstable midfield against Sevilla (4-1 win to RM, last week) before his substitution. One more note, Ronaldo and Benzema fall back when the opponents attack. They help the midfield or at least they press the opposition. The tactics from Zidane to cut the passing lines has worked out magnificently. Ron and Benz do that. This makes the opponents to lose the ball possession. However, its all about the individual brilliance that saves Real Madrid most of the time. PS:  1. Isco/Modric have improved in tackling. They too contribute to the role of CDM. (Bale is out of the season) 2. Casemiro has a lot to improve.",

        "a": "Marvel, yes, copied some of the superheroes and their powers from DC. And DC did the same as well. For eg., the last names of Sam Wilson, Wade Wilson and Slade Wilson. Wilson is totally stolen. Also, the some of the abilities of Wade Wilson and Slade Wilson are same (like sword fighting, durability etc.). The latter two even bare similar names - Deadpool and Deathstroke. The Arrow guys - Green Arrow and Hawk eye. The Aquatic superheroes - Aquaman and Namor. The name conflict - Captain Marvel. It is first coined in a comic which doesn\u2019t even belong to DC or Marvel. But Marvel copied the name and gave the name barer their ultimate cosmic powers. But it is a woman. Meanwhile, DC bought that character and made their own reply to Superman, the Shazam. Coming to Superman - Marvel\u2019s version of Superman is Hyperion, who is a part of the Squadron Supreme. He\u2019s kind of an antagonist for a while but was turned to do good eventually. The shrinking guys - Antman and The Atom - both of them can both shrink down to the size of an atom or lower and can become a giant-level beings. Their Avengers is DC\u2019s Justice League. Their Nova Corps is DC\u2019s Green Lantern Corps. Ultron and Brainiac Thanos and Darkseid Oscorp and Lexcorp Wasp and Bumblebee. One of the most fascinating and debated topics - Quick Silver and the Flash. Black Widow and Black Canary (names and costumes) Mr Fantastic and Plastic man The Vision and the Red Tornado These are some of the characters which are commonly defined between the two comic giants. Although, both of them happened to copy characters from one anothers, only one of the characters from either of them have been able to shine. I don\u2019t remember whose characters were published first for all the above listed characters, but it seems that Marvel is one naughty comic book franchise that copied characters. Whatever they may copy, Marvel will or can never create a \u201cBatman\u201d and DC can never create a \u201cSpiderman\u201d or a \u201cDaredevil\u201d or a \u201cHulk\u201d or steal the aura created by these individual comic. Which characters have DC copied from Marvel? What are the darkest moments in Marvel and DC? Did Marvel comics rip ideas off of DC? Who would win in a fight: Black Panther or Batman? Who do you think will win in a DC vs Marvel war? Because Marvel and DC have copied each other extensively throughout their histories. In an industry where all of the creative talent: writers, artists, letterers, inkers, and editors, move between the two companies some crossover is going to occur. If something works in one universe, eventually the other universe is going to try something similar. DC : marvel Superman :hyperion/ sentry Darkseid :thanos (even they accept) Black canary :black widow (same costumes) Aquaman :namor Solomon grundy :hulk Plastic man : mr fantastic Red tornado : vision(resemblance is same ) Flash :quick silver Atom : ant man Slade wilson(death stroke) ; wade wilson (deadpool) Batman : blue eagle ( though he cant be compared to batman much ) Lexcorp : oscorp Dr Fate : dr strange Arrow :hawkeye Captain marvel ( shazam) : Captain marvel Brainiac :ultron Green lantern corps : nova corps Doom petrol : xmen Deadshot: bullseye And a few more which i have surely missed out ! In some cases they did. In some cases the reverse is true. If you Google (or even search on Quora), there are plenty of examples of the one company basing characters on a character from the other. Because a lot of the Marvel characters are not completely original. Deathstroke? / Deadpool Green arrow? / Hawkeye The flash? / Quicksilver the list goes on.",

        "a": "Religion is  deen  in  Arabic , which comes from the  Sumerian  (4000 BC) word din, bright light, which is  ten  in  Turkish  and  tin  in  Mongolian.  Dingir  is God in Sumerian, the light creator, also  Tengri  in Turkish and  Tingir  in Mongolian.  Din  derivatives, after semantic shifts are all on religion:  Old Persian  (1000 BC) word  dena , legal and social way of life,  Akkadian /Babylonian/Assyrian (2000 BC) word  deen , social order,  Hebrew  (1000 BC) word  din , law, even possibly but not definitely the  Sanskrit  (1000 BC)  dharma , way of life. Therefore religion in European languages has emphasis on underlying  beliefs  and rituals, whereas religion has more  social  emphasis in where it started. In Arabic there are the words  millet  or  medhab  for belief sets. For a religion to exist you need a community above all - beliefs come second. In fact there are religions without explicit beliefs.  American Way of Life  (also referred as  Freedom  for short) is a religion without a precise belief set but nevertheless glues 300m people together even in extreme cases like World Wars with rules mutually agreed upon.  Leninism  was a religion with better defined divine (called scientific) text. To create a new religion you need to create a self-sustainable community. If it is too small yet with strong cohesion, it is a  cult . Let us look from the size point of view: Order of 1 \u2014 Usually people conducting extremely unconventional life-styles, such as long-term serial killers, have  one-man religions , with well-defined but unconventional sets of relations between concepts and actions. Sometimes a lifestyle for an atomic family may be described an isolate religion, satirised in the movie Captain Fantastic. Order of 10 \u2014 There are  clan-sized religions , again usually involving unconventional or illegal life-styles, very hard to sustain therefore needing an extremely dominant family leader to decree the rules. Order of 100 \u2014  Cults  also demand very strong community leadership to make up for the pressures of the outside larger community. Highest priority of a cult is on membership loyalty and coherence. Order of 1000 \u2014  Large cults or small religions , are usually self-sufficient due to several alternative members for professional needs. If they are geographically distributed, higher professions are usually within membership. If geographically compact, lower professional competencies would do. Order of 10000 \u2014 There is no further pressure on the community to declare itself a separate religion because of its established self-sufficiency, unforced intermarriage, intra-community jobs, entertainment and news, and can define itself as an  independent church , denomination, order or other terminology that accepts the umbrella of a broader religion. Yet it also sees itself separate. If the foundations are completely different from an existing belief set or not based on an established divine text, a critical decision may be made to call itself a separate religion. Therefore it primarily depends on the number of members and their cohesion rather than the beliefs alone. What elements are required to create a new religion? Can anyone create a new religion? Why or why not? How do I create a religion? Is there a need for a new religion? I want to create a new religion. Where do I start? There are thousands of religions, and each one has its own followers believe that they follow the true one. Why not just create their own reli... People these days hate religion. They think religion is evil. They are at one level, there are some people who are beyond that level, they hate government as well. Government today is more powerful than religion in any country. They use religion as a pawn to come up. The Godmen use theism as a pawn to raise up. Anyway, because of all these powers either pulling you down or pulling you sideways, it is very difficult to create a new religion. Many Godmen have come up in India in last 70 years of independence, none of them are successful in creating a new religion, not even a new caste. Basavanna in karnataka founded Lingayat caste, Guru Nanak found Sikh religion. After that all others are creating a following, a group that is not really a caste or a religion. Aryasamaj, Brahmasamaj, Akbar\u2019s new religion, all wilted. Modern gurus are just reinforcing people\u2019s religious thoughts, catering to what people think they need. They are becoming succesful, they are getting what they are not creating a new religion. Creating a religion depends on where you live. In India, it is very very tough. Hinduism is a non-religion. If you call religion 1, non religion is 0. As Shankaracharya said, shoonyat shoonyamaadaaya shoonyameva parishishyate, you take out nothing from nothing, add nothing to nothing, let nothing be undisturbed, it remains nothing. It is like a black hole. However, you can consider current Indian constitution which is so confusing as a religion, that's what defines us now. But I am like you, I want a new religion. I think religion is better than government. I want religion to take over government and religion should be flexible and productive.",

You should also showcase your achievements and certifications if any. I personally feel, resume is blueprint of your personality. Never missout any point. never overdo any thing, just make it as you are. Making digital cv for such things is good option, but online resume builder are usually costly. there are few websites which I personally like 1:  Resume.com 2:  Best Professional Resume CV Maker and Online CV Builder - CVCrow 3:  Resume Builder : MyPerfectResume.com How do I make a CV? What skills make for an interesting CV? As a high school student, how can I make an interesting CV? How can I display my interests in CS more strongly in my CV? How do I make it to a top notch B School? B-schools today look for applicants who are out of the box. Therefore it is essential that you keep your resume as interesting as you. Some of the pointers which will help you create an outstanding resume: You start with your name and contact details. Give a brief summary on what you do. Keep it as crisp as possible. Give a clear career timeline leaving no scope for ambiguity Focus on presenting your achievements across the organizations that you\u2019ve worked for. Highlight the difference that you can bring in to the organization if they hire you. Stay out of the ordinary. Use colors, use visuals like graphs and charts to make it stand out from the pile of ordinary resumes. The key is get noticed to get hired. Use keywords strategically that it meets the readers eye and at the same time gets picked up by search filters. Stay away from: Objectives on your resume. Everyone knows what objectives are and at the same time don\u2019t really care what your objectives are. Your KRAs or roles are responsibilities across your past employers. This information is not of any use to your new employer because they have their own set of roles and responsibilities and they only have to know if you have the necessary skills to perform that. Your hobbies are not going to make any difference in the employers decision making. You being the topper in your school or being the captain of a cricket team is again not going to make a difference to the employer if they are hiring you for the position of a developer. So use only information that is going to make a difference to them. Do not exceed the number of pages on your resume. Try to constrain it to a one page resume or if its really unavoidable, increase it to a two page resume. Anything more than two pages will work against you. Forget about increasing content by adding fields such as references available on request and a useless declaration. You are only stating the obvious. If the employer wants references, they will ask you for it irrespective of you mentioning that on your resume.

        "a": "The question as stated is too general. Many many people are spiritual, or consider themselves spiritual. Whether they have an ego would require a massive study, but most likely it would find they do exhibit symptoms of ego, just like everyone else. However I will answer from a different perspective:  Is the object of living a spiritual life to circumvent the ego? To this I would say very much  YES . You see the ego is the sum of the animal \u201cmaterial mind\u201d that we got as a part of evolution. Its vitally necessary, you cant live without it. But as you grow spiritually what you are doing is growing your soul, which is what you gained from God, and what distinguishes us from all animals. And, after a huge amount of spiritual growth, it is possible to operate out of soul, and ensure the material mind, aka ego, is no longer in control. I have experienced this state for 24 hours, so I do know what I am talking about. You do literally lose your mind. I live in hope I can achieve this state permanently, If you are interested in hat it is like to ny have an ego,  I described my experience here. How is the ego useful in the spiritual journey? Why do people go spiritual? What does spirituality/philosophy say about ego? How do I overcome my ego to be able to learn from other people? What is an ego? Is having an ego a bad thing, psychologically speaking? We on the earth plane all have an ego, a desire to feel separate an unique, and yet a spiritual individual surrenders this concept and reminds themselves that their identity will pass and the greater and eternal part knows only it is an extension of creation and of the Creator. We meditate and live being reminded of this truth, rather than feel we depend on others to either help us or to be exploited etc etc. Spiritual people are mindful of their flaws and boundaries, and for that matter others. Yes, they have an ego. Ideally they have understood that their ego is their barrier and \u201cwork\u201d on that. But in reality many spiritual people have a very big egos (\u201cI am so spiritual\u201d, \u201cI am more intelligent than others\u201d, \u201cI am such a good person and take care about others\u201d, \u201cI am right and I know better. My spirituality is the only way\u201d \u2026) Of course spiritual people have an ego. An ego is very useful in daily life. Without one, you would not even answer to the call of your name.

        "a": "Based on your limited question, in relationship to body part being operated on I can only give vague generalities about the procedure. If you guys would give just a little bit of non patient identity information I wouldn't have to go into these long winded explanations and have my my index finger go numb! Anyway here goes nothing. Personally I see no down side to flap surgery other than the obvious potential post operative infection rate that can be minimized by proper surgical techniques and maintaining a sterile field. One consideration is patient discomfort, alright, pain, associated with tissue expanders placed under the shin and periodically increased in diameter with saline injections to make the skin stretch and expand to give the surgeon ample tissue to either close a wound or create a tissue enhancement. Breast reconstruction: With more and more women being tested for the Braca ll? gene and electing for radical bilateral mastectomies, the incidence of tissue expander being placed on the backs of these women for future reconstruction surgery has become quite common. I've been out of the hospital rotation for almost 2 years and generally I avoided breast reconstruction and gyn work when I was in. I stuck mostly to trauma. Blood and guts was my thing. But for the ladies, having this option, and having it  paid  buy insurance is a big deal, because they are preemptively taking their future heath into their own control. Pretty ballzy. And salute each and evey one of one of you that have had to make this difficult decision. Let's move on. Oral surgery: The mouth is a nasty place place. There are more bugs in there than you can shake a stick at. But one of the most common flap surgeries is the repair of badly worn down and eaten away gum disease. Gingivitis. Poor oral care or just bad genes. Take your pick. If need this repair job, I can only say just suck it up and get it done. My father had to have this procedure done a number of years ago and to a very competent oral surgeon in town here. He did a good job and my dads gums are covering his roots of his teeth. He's much happier about the situation now. The procedure is done in such a way as to preserve the microvasculature of the flap being put into transposition. Meaning, the surgeon attempts to maintain the the native blood supply to the tissue being rotated around into place to give the tissue the best odds at surviving in its new home. The donor site is pulled together and sutured back together. I sat in on one such surgery, the surgeon asked me if I want to watch him work and I said sure. So I pulled up a stool and adjusted the extra viewing port on the microscope and watched him sew the smallest sutures I'd ever seen. Half way through he asked me if I was bored yet. I told him no. He said plastics was all about getting as many of the tiny blood vessels sewn together as possible. He was a deconstructionist, not a boobs and butt MD. So, I hope, if your still with me, that you got a little bit of onsite out of my experience with flap surgery. For more details and images I highly recommended that you do a Google search of Flap Surgery. There is plenty to look at and read over that may pertain to your particular situation. Best of luck, and remember to always ask questions until you are satisfied with the answers being given. Terry",

He then started the first Secret Wars (the one they don\u2019t acknowledge any more) by collecting a whole load of villains and heroes and ptting them down on a world he created that looked as if it was made of lots of worlds. This led to a long battle, during which several things happened. Dr Doom gave powers to Titania and Volcana, who then fell for the Absorbing Man and the Molecule Man respectively. It was the original appearance of Venom, and The Thing lost the ability to change back to Ben. All of which have since been retconned I think. Doom then takes on the Beyonder directly and defeats him, and tries to destroy the heroes. They sort themselves out and mange to get him to lose control of the Beyonder\u2019s power. And then Reed richards figures out a way to get them home. Then there was a second storyline where the Beyonder comes to earth and tries to figure out humans. He eventually decides the only way to do so is to become one, and builds a machine to turn him into one. when he is in it, the Molecule Man destroys the machine and reopens the portal to his home.

Let's talk about the learning material available for you for free. Here's a YouTube channel TheNewBoston. You can start from here: Python 3.4 Programming Tutorials - YouTube The tutorials provided are great to start with. They are absolutely free, you don't have to pay anything to start learning python! Now let's talk about other options You should consider thorough python courses provided on Udemy. There are two types of courses in there paid ones and free ones. I will suggest you to start with the free ones and then move onto the paid ones. Free courses are often as good as the paid ones though. You can view all the free courses offered on Udemy by following this link: View all the free udemy courses- Become skillful for free If you decide to also take a look at the paid options, here is the blog post that talks about top python courses: Online learning courses on Python programming language You can also consider looking at other learning platforms like: Coursera Codeacademy Khan Academy Freecodecamp Just make sure which ever python course you take, practice hard, coding looks simple when you watch the videos. But when you sit and actually start to code you tend to forget all you learned. Its highly advisable to practice along only then you can do well. Hope it helps! Feel free to ask if you have any other question! Happy learning! Between Java and Python, which one is better to learn first and why? Should I learn Python if I know PHP already? As a beginner can I make Scala as my first programming language? Or Do I need to first learn Core Java and Python? I don't want to learn C++. I want to learn C or C++ programming language. I do not know anything about either, or programming, which should I learn first? Or are there o... I wanted to learn .NET, but I don't know Java. I know C and C++. Shall I learn .NET before learning Java? If you really want to be a data scientist, I don't know why you were studying PHP. It's exclusively for web programming. Python would be much more appropriate. (Java is okay, too.) There are plenty of online courses for programming in Python, Java, etc. You don't need a person to instruct you. For beginners, I always recommend this answer:  Richard Kenneth Eng's answer to What is the easiest, best and simplest program language to learn? A2A. Original question: \u201cl\u2019m starting learn Python, but I don't know where to learn first. I've learned English and know some languages like PHP and Java. Can you instruct me?\u201d You seem motivated and I'm glad to assist them. There already are good answers which will be helpful. As long as your programming fundamentals are good, you should not have trouble picking new programming language. Python is no exception. It's a mix of scripting and OOP like Java.

        "a": "One of my teachers held out the possibility of earning a score of 5, or even 6 \u2014 although the grade scale for the college course transcript only went from 0 (F) to 4 (A). Allow me to explain. When I was in high school I was one of several students in the area selected to attend one university class per semester at our local Penn State University branch campus (popularly known as \u201chigh school with ashtrays\u201d). They offered and advanced English course and it happened that the only students who enrolled were, like me, high school students selected for exceptional ability. The professor expected, and received, \u201cA\u201d level work from all of us. He wanted to motivate us to keep trying harder, but he didn\u2019t do that by giving us Bs or Cs that would have led to low marks on the transcript for excellent work. Instead he gave a mark of 4 (A) for almost every paper. He held out the possibility of a score of 5, and he did give a few of those. And there was the ever elusive 6 that no one ever received! This was an excellent form of motivation. He also gave the most difficult final exam I ever took. We read  Crime and Punishment  and Plato\u2019s  Republic  and other books. The final exam consisted of one question. \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d What is the best thing your teacher ever told you? What are some of the best and most creative print advertisements you have ever seen? Teachers: What is the cutest thing that your student(s) have ever done? What did you find out about your teacher that shocked you? What is the best thing a teacher or a professor has ever done in the class? When I was in 11th grade, I took a night school English class to fulfill my credit requirement ahead of time, although a number of the other kids in the class were there to avoid summer school. The teacher was one of the best I ever had. It happened that we had a class on Halloween, and of course all of us were pretty bummed about that, but he found a great way to make it fun. I walked into the classroom, and sitting on his desk were a bunch of Xeroxed documents, a giant bowl of candy, and a candle. He lit the candle, turned out the lights, and passed out the candy and the documents - which turned out to be copies of \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado\u201d, one of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s most delightfully creepy stories. The teacher had worked as a Shakespearean actor, and was great with voices and accents. He read us \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado\u201d in class, by candlelight, complete with different voices for Montresor and Fortunato, dramatic pauses, the whole shebang. It was wonderful! Like listening to an old-time radio broadcast. Even the kids in the class who were terrible students and to whom the idea of reading a book for pleasure was completely alien loved it. Easily one of the most creative teaching moments I\u2019ve ever experienced.",

        "a": "You might want to tighten up the criteria a little. 1279 where? Not a lot going on in that year. What have they got with them, technology-wise, etc? There is a  fictional series  about an American town which gets transported back to Europe in 1632, into the middle of the Hundred Years\u2019 War. I only read the first book, as I got bored reading about good ol\u2019 boys a-whoopin\u2019 n a-hollerin\u2019 n a-shootin\u2019 up the place. In short, they were right where they belonged - in an uncivilised war zone. There\u2019s also  John Birmingham\u2019s excellent but weighty Axis of Time series , about a 2021 US-led multinational task-force that gets sent back in time to WWII. This really explores the issues of cross-time pollution  and  individual reaction to being stuck irrevocably in the past, leaving friends and loved ones behind. Eric Flint, author of the 1632 series, turns up in the Axis of Time series as a Secret Service agent. If I were teleported to 550 million BC, how could I survive? What could I eat? If you could teleport back in time, what would happen if you teleport back to present of which you are teleporting while teleporting? What is it like to move back to India after a long time in the USA? Do you regret moving back to India from USA? Is time travel possible? Due to the time of 1783 being a part of the Enlightenment period while 1279 being apart of the \u201cChristian dominance\u201d, I can imagine some ideological backlash among the two eras. But for now, let\u2019s focus on the geography. I take it you want to also transport the people along with their belongings and homes back in time to 1279 on the exact location that they left earth from (aka  Back to the Future  style of time travel). In which case there would be a bit of fighting between the native Indians and the Europeans, but I think that with the 1783\u2019s immunity to disease as well as advanced weaponry would pretty much dominate the area. Aside from the mass confusion of everyone in the colonies, trade would be an issue. There would be no trade with any of the European mainlands (at least for now) due to them not even hearing about the \u201cnew colonies of America\u201d. This would be a problem for Americans as our economy is currently faltering at this point in time, but I think that the Americans would most likely use the newly abundant resources at their disposal (ex. the trees that they cut down to build their houses are now sprung back to life). So overall, our economy should be stable. As for the mingling of many cultures, let\u2019s just say it won\u2019t end well for either side. The Americans would most likely expand (like they already did in our timeline) and might actually make it to present day Oregon before the end of the century (due to the land not being held by anyone at this point in time (i.e. British forts, Louisiana Purchase, and Spanish conquering). With the America\u2019s use of firepower (guns are not invented until 1364) as well as our strength in numbers (estimated around 3.1 million + at the start of 1783)*, we may actually take hold of Canada (a necessity by Americans at the time that actually started the War of 1812), Mexico (again, Americans wanted Mexico as seen in the events prior to the Mexican-American War), and the Caribbean Islands (do I need to talk about the Spanish-American War?). The Indians as well as the Europeans occupying the area at the time would not stand a chance against the American force. *With a projected growing economy and standard of living, the population in THIS timeline would most likely be more than the 3.1 million stated earlier. As for conflicts with Europe, I doubt there would be any. Despite the continent conquering new America, it was pretty isolationist at the time in our timeline. It would only make sense that the Americas in 1279 would have the same mindset. But when the war dies down, there are 3 projected paths the Americans may go towards: America spreads its influence across the world with its new acquired trading partners. The influence of 1783 America would bring an end to the Dark Ages in Europe, bring about a Renaissance hundreds of years earlier than in our timeline, and bring America into the realm of an empire. They continue their isolationist ideals until the times catch up with them. The other countries may catch up with America by either stealing some of their technology or (like in our timeline) gradually come up with the ideas for the technology themselves. This result is historically slower than the one previously mentioned, but the exact slowness may vary. America finds no use in trading and becomes completely self-reliant and isolationist. Other countries might perceive the Americas as the threat due to the Americas indifferent attitude towards the other nations at the time. The end result might bring about a war that will include almost all of Europe against the Americas. They might even call it a new crusade (Enlightenment thinking with the strong Protestantism in the Americas is seen as a threat to the Catholic Europe, way before the idea of Protestantism became a reality with Martin Luther). The most likely outcome is America winning this supposed war, crippling Europe, and will either lead to a: Invasion of Europe or No response by the Americans In my opinion, I would say that the most likely outcome would either be option #2 or #3, due to the American\u2019s strong resentment of Europe at the time (this is right after the American Revolution keep in mind), but I\u2019ll keep the theoreticals to a minimum. It couldn't trade as much with Europe, they would Dominate the Americas. They would have to be more self sufficient since they are no longer doing heavy trading with Europe nations. But the map would be insane, by present day they would have all of America, and would be the most scientificly advanced Nation on the planet. When Spain had a more stable economy and wouldn't rely on Gold from Mexico. By now we would have a Colony set up on Mars. And the time the industria revolution came around in Europ, we would have produced 1,000,000,000 Figet Spinners I think if you are mentioning to 1783\u2019s U.S. to 1279? So I will have some scenario: Earlier industrial revolution: definitely the people in Europe would have found that they needed to catch up with the United States. Soon they would take any risks to do it. The techs from America would have been exported into the worldwide and we would have computer at late 16th century. Lol. The American would have to expand its culture far away than most of other countries. They would have occupied all the Americas and it would become English-language dominant. World Wars would have come earlier. At 18th century, no, not Seven Years\u2019 War - it would have been WWI. And in early 19th century, Emperor Napoleon stood on the tanks and declared WWII. By the end of 20th century, so many space ships from Earth\u2019d gone explore the world and we would have had laser guns and super troops. I bet that is what I know about scenario. But of course with it, they would have met a lot of resistance and also, there would have other difficulties - the Ottoman Empire would have never been founded. Russia, China would have problems and India would have hard time to reunite (but of course no Pakistan, no Bangladesh, no Nepal). And wtf? Soccer space too?",

        "a": "Anorexia is about how much you eat . When you are anorexic,  food , not your body, is the all-consuming focus. And I do mean all-consuming. Anorexics look at food, cook food, hoard food, fantasize about food, and learn all available facts about food. It\u2019s an obsession laced with horror, as the same object that is most wanted is known to reduce your worth if you consume it. Orthorexia is about what you eat . Orthorexics sort food by type, excluding or including entire categories of food in pursuit of diets that they believe are healthier, or in more extreme cases, that do not make them feel ill. Weight and quantity of food consumed are not a focus at all, the goal is avoiding elements of food believed to be deleterious, or entire foods and food groups that are believed to be bad for people. The obsession with food, and the tendency of orthorexics to associate adherence to their dietary choices with moral superiority and personal satisfaction have some resemblance to similar ends experienced in anorexia, but the goals of the eating behavior, and the aspects of food and eating focused upon are different in each case. Food-related OCD is about how you eat.  Obsessive-compulsive ideas about how food ought to be approached and consumed become a focus for the sake of the eating rituals themselves. The size of bites of food, order in which food must be eaten, and number of times bites must be chewed are typical manners in which this can manifest. These individuals don\u2019t aim for health, as orthorexics do, and it is not the food itself, but the rituals surrounding eating that are disruptive to the food-related OCD person\u2019s life. Dieting is about losing weight . Dieters want to eat, but try not to. Fear of food does not exist for them. They think about food when they\u2019re hungry, not all the time. They don\u2019t believe in magical ways to be healthier than others through application of supplements or exclusions of groups of foods. You also won\u2019t find them obsessively repeating their methods of eating food, or repeating their meals because it feels  wrong  to do things differently. They\u2019re just trying to lose weight, and know they can accomplish that by cutting calories. In practice, there is significant bleed between all of these categories, and one practice or problem can easily develop into another one of these issues. But the basic distinctions are found in the   motivations  behind the focus upon food, and he  methods  that are used to accomplish whatever food-related goal exists. What is the difference between anorexia nervosa and orthorexia nervosa? How can I recover from anorexia? Is orthorexia closely related to ocd? Is anorexia a life-long illness? How can I get anorexia on purpose? Anorexia  proper  means \u201c[a condition marked by] a loss of appetite\u201d, with \u201cappetite\u201d in the wide sense, of \u201ca conscious or unconscious desire to eat\u201d. Anorexia nervosa is a kind of anorexia, and a recognized psychological disorder, in which people starve themselves \u2014 even though they feel hunger (i.e. experience unconscious appetite). The common cause of anorexia nervosa seems to be a sense of loss of control, which is remedied by seeking control over the self in the form of conquering self-inflicted pain. In this pure sense it\u2019s akin to automutilation. Most commonly, the sense of a loss of control is related to body image, which would technically make it comorbid with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). (The latter diagnosis explicitly excludes it, however.) That\u2019s not necessary though; a number of sufferers don\u2019t want to become underweight. Orthorexia is so new it might as well be simply a synonym for \u201cfood-related obsession\u201d (of any cause) \u2014 possibly even grounded in reality. OCD is classified as an anxiety disorder, but i.m.o. that (anxiety) is only a very common comorbidity. Obsessions and possible assorted compulsions are in turn coping mechanisms, which may focus on food, but are not fundamentally related to it, or anything else. They are coping mechanisms for something internal. Just because you are obsessed with something does not mean you have OCD. Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder diagnosis. Orthorexia is not yet a diagnosis, but generally describes the behavior of people who confuse food with morality. OCD is a behavior disorder, which may or may not involve food rituals. I have no idea what you mean by \u201cwidespread dieting practices\u201d. If you mean weight loss diets, those are just temporary adjustments to diet that people do out of ignorance, thinking that they actually work. Anorexia is a deadly psychiatric disease that kills people through a long and terrible process of starvation. Victims are usually young girls. Orthorexia is a disorder in thought processes slightly related to a possible deeper psychological problem. It\u2019s an obsession with food-stuffs but not to the depth of an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a psychiatric disease which can and do concentrate on food, eating, dieting, etc. Widespread dieting practices are bona fide attempts by us (sufferers!) trying to change and rectify our lifestyles.",

Before it\u2019s fulfilled it\u2019s just \u201crantings of someone who wants the world to be better / worse.\u201d Prophets are an interesting bunch. The act of prophecy has to be distinguished from \u2018mere\u2019 soothsaying, augury, or divination. Prophets have to be adjudicated for the ones more interested in worldly ambition than in simply conveying God\u2019s will. So a would-be prophet has to toe a fine line. Prophecies suggesting messengers seems a bit weird. Isn\u2019t a prophecy a message? Are we having a pre-meeting meeting so we can pre-plan the plan? Prophesizing a messiah at least makes sense. How do you become a Messiah? Were there other Messiah stories similar to Jesus' near the time of his death? Who was the Messiah of the Naassenes? Did Jesus have a messiah complex? At some time in the distant future, will science have advanced so much that Christianity, Islam etc. will be viewed the same way that classica... I don\u2019t have any specific prophecies to give you, but logically, look at how the world cannot determine what the truth is anymore (i.e Donald Trump). Look at how the environment (esp. climate) is getting worse. Look at how monetary economics is on the brink of collapse. Look at the wealth gap around the world. Look at leaders like Kim Jong Un threatening the world with nukes. Look at terrorists groups like ISIS. Look at the potential dangers of AI. Now prophecies like the Book of Revelations or Nostradamus are pretty vague and you can fit many of today\u2019s issues into them. But I believe we can see that humanity on planet earth will not last much longer with the current ways of life. And since good always triumphs over evil (light triumphs over darkness). Someone or multiple people (inspired by God) will come forth to bring about solutions. If we want to label them prophets or a messiah, that is up to us\u2026 So far, there hasn\u2019t been a single significant unambiguous prophesy in the recorded history of the human species, so if you used that as evidence we have that to suggest that no significant unambiguous prophesies will ever be made. (Nostradamus comes close once in a while, though.) There are plenty of prophesies in religious books but \u2026 They\u2019re either ambiguous, misinterpreted, so trivial that no one cares or just plain wrong. I refer to Mother Shipton prophecies of 1587 AD. We know who we are. We think our experience is already set out in concrete. Yet this has been told many centuries ago. The entire document is so long. Living in the same time as Nostradamus. Now one was a bleed over of psychic energy to another. Both were healers and scribes. Scribe means able to print and know who to write down ideas. In the very minimum Mother Shipton did a thing which would be called going so far beyond what any sci fi of these last two centuries could have made possible. Genius, then call a genius a genius. Find and print it and check off each and every line which says more than enough information. When you get to the end find me and then discuss messiah, but not before then.",

Don\u2019t look at marriage ceremony as an obligation on your part to your parents and the kith and kin and the immediate surrounding societal milieu of your parents. Indian society is yet to mature into a truly egalitarian society in any respect, be it social equality of all castes,languages and gender as well. It is heavily diced against women and their sensitivities, from time immemorial. However a stable relationship of life long comradiery and mutual respect and concern is discernible as on today only in arranged marriages. This is because, marriage is a commitment in the Indian Society irrespective of caste hierarchy. Be it North or South. It is not a CONTRACT. I am not defending this arrangement. Nor I am unaware of transgressions by both parties during the reproductive span of their life. That is normal. However I will advice to newly married people both men and women to strive hard to make it a successful journey together. All the best of luck. And you need some luck as well. What are some tips for a newly married Indian female to lead a good married life? Dating and Relationships: Is it a good idea to marry an Indian girl without a uterus? Why, or why not? Can a Indian girl marry a Kashmiri boy? How can Indian men find Russian women for a relationship and for marriage in India? Do Russian women like getting married to Indian men? What will be the life of a Indian boy/man who marries a socially active girl? I am not married but I can attempt at some advise. Fall in love hard with your husband. (considering you are living in a happy mutual relationship) Don't lose your respect. Ask for equality. Question your in laws. Don't say silent. Assert yourself. Eat all you want. I know some of my friends who eat less because they don't want in laws to assume that they are  bhukkad. Don't give your lifestyle a makeover. You want tea in bed? Inform your husband. Love to read? Assert for reading time. Like to sleep late? Your wish (you won't be sleeping early anyways.) Don't forget your parents. Meet them often. You don't need anybody's permission to do that. Invest in lingerie. It's fine if you have not tried them till now. But experiment now. Finally learn to be diplomatic. You are going to need it.",

        "a": "That\u2019s a great question, and the answer depends on your view of the ecosystem as a whole. If you want to bet against Bitcoin, but are for the ecosystem as a whole (ie other cryptocurrencies will still exist despite BTC), then investing in popular public alt-blockchains like ETH and LTC is a good hedge against this. If BTC collapses, but the ecosystem is still in-tact, the chance of these coins absorbing that value is quite good. If you want to bet against BTC regardless of the ecosystem, that I would recommend looking into option trading on BTC. Some binary option trading service have become available in the last few years:  New Binary Options Trading Service Takes Bitcoin-Only Payments I would recommend you research into these services and find one that offers the trade you\u2019re looking for. I think someone sent me 2.041 Bitcoins accidentally. Is there a way they can reverse it? I want to keep the Bitcoins. What is the best way to buy XRP (digital asset)? Should I invest in Bitcoin? Is Bitcoin a good bet? Who missed Bitcoin and wants to start over again? It depends on whether you want to bet on fiat(USD) vs Bitcoin or altcoins vs Bitcoin. For USD vs Bitcoin , here are a few exchanges where you can short Bitcoin Kraken  - short BTC on margin Bitmex  - 100x leverage futures trading Okcoin.com  - 20x leverage futures trading. Not available to US citizens and currently having USD deposit issues. They are still the world leader in BTC futures trading based on volume. If you want to bet on altcoins vs Bitcoin then the most liquid exchange is  Poloniex . If you want to exchange smaller amounts you can use  Shapeshift . Good luck. You\u2019re going to need it if you intend on shorting BTC vs USD long-term. If you are going to go with altcoins, I\u2019d suggest Ethereum. I\u2019ve detailed my thoughts on why I\u2019m extremely bullish on Ethereum in another post. Ken Liu's answer to What are your thoughts about the Ethereum cryptocurrency? You can buy options to short Bitcoin, but be warned as Bitcoin has fundamental value as a evolving network. It is difficult to predict accurately the price of Bitcoin in a short amount of time and the market volume is probably much much larger than your entire wallet. It\u2019s not just \u201cdigital gold\u201d as a store of value. The amount of users is growing and you can easily lose money. If you believe that another cryptocurrency is going to rise in conjunction with a fall, you may also do margin trading. But this is very risky. If you need to margin trade with USD, the fully legit sites that offer some sort of \u201cinsurance\u201d require you to be an accredited investor (basically a millionaire) If you still are convinced, those are the easiest ways for you to bet against Bitcoin.  I am not responsible for your losses.  Good luck on any possible gains. The current exchanges use to buy and sell bitcoins don't support shorting the currency at the moment. If the SEC allows the Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) to pass, then you should be able to short it at that time, but for now that's not possible. On a personal note, I would probably do a little more research on cryptocurrency, specially bitcoin. Bitcoin is now legally being use in a lot of countries, and Japan has started a bitcoin initiative where there will have over 250,000 stores accepting bitcoin as currency by the end of the 2017 summer. The popularity of bitcoin has grown strong and fast. Besides what is your basis on why you think bitcoin has no long term value and other cryptocurrency do? There is no currency anywhere in the world that's backed by anything. Not even the USD is backed by anything. Any future cryptocurrency that claims to be backed by central banks will end up just like every other FIAT currency currently being in use. They are all worthless because central banks can create them at will. The value of bitcoin comes from two things. One is the agreement between two or more individuals accepting it as a for of payment, which it shares with all other currencies in the world and the second reason why bitcoin has value and can only go up in value from here, is the simple fact that bitcoin has a finite amount of coins that can ever be created, 21 million to be exact. This means that the more people that use it, the more it has to be worth. Something the FIAT currency will never have, and a lot of the other cryptocurrency don't have either. The only way bitcoin will fail or any other cryptocurrency would surpass it is if the entire ecosystem collapse, which by the way, I don't see it happening anytime soon. But I wish you luck never the less.",

It'll show you the company name, number of students placed in that company, internship stipend if it offers an internship, and the CTC (cost to company) in lakhs. The figures provided in the website are authentic. (I provided you with the number of students in each class so that you may calculate the number of students placed and the total number of students at KMIT) It is my advice that you go through Finishing School after you have gone through placements on the website. It will show you a clear distinction of KMIT from other JNTU affiliated colleges in Hyderabad(also Telangana), it also lets you understand why it is a better college than the rest. I can assure you that students at the end of their engineering tenure are \u201ccompany ready\u201d i.e they understand the technology used in the company and are far better than any other average jntu student (We learn and understand languages or develop skills by practice and not by rote memory). As for if KMIT lies in the top 10 colleges,I leave it for you to decide, providing you with a fact that, the cut off EAMCET rank for CSE of last year intake was roughly between 6500 to 8000 and i expect it to be much lower this year. All the very best! Is KMIT a good college for CSE? Is the 2nd branch named NGIT, which is in Uppal, a good branch? What campus should I prefer most for CSE? Can I get CSE or ECE in the top 10 colleges of IPU with a CET rank of 7136? What are the top 10 colleges in Hyderabad for a Btech? What are some good colleges in COMEDK for CSE and ECE (other than the top 10)? Which is better, CVSR or KMIT for CSE? Hi, firstly, I haven't checked the institutes website or their placement cell so I\u2019m just gonna say whatever is true. If you are confused whether to join in KMIT or not, well go for it. As far as it is placed in top 10 colleges or not, who cares, really who cares. Once you step into a college, its your new home and it will always stay in the top for you through out. KMIT is a well renowned college for its location in the middle of the city, lot of students choose KMIT because it is easy to travel and bunk classes and still find good places around to spend time unlike most of the other colleges that are located in the corners. Some of my friend studied there and I've heard everything positive about the college. You don\u2019t have to worry about the faculty or placements because rest of the other colleges have equally experienced faculty and placements cells running in the similar manner. As you are taking CSE, I\u2019m sure you will get placed by the end of your graduation if you work hard or even manage to get good grades. Oh, ya remember communication, English language, good speaking skills, soft skills and little knowledge on the subject will get you placed in every company you attend. During first and last years, You will definitely love the college and during second and third year, I don\u2019t know, why don\u2019t you let us know your opinion if your attendance percentage is above 70% or\u2026.. :) I've not much heard about the second new branch of KMIT but I advice you to not take a chance now\u2026 because its their very first year that decides their rank on the list so don\u2019t take a risk. Anyway, trust me you don\u2019t have to think lot about joining in KMIT and you won\u2019t regret choosing it. A friend of my brother is studying his CSE final year in KMIT so if you got any other questions just let me know, I\u2019m always waiting to do some research. All the best. Kmit is a top college as of 2017 rankings. Nevertheless KMIT is a good college. Its best for CSE and ECE. You find a lot of opportunities for CSE students. There\u2019s a program called Finishing School(FS) for CSE students to make themselves well trained with programming languages. You will receive training for all these from top faculty lecturers. All you need to do is follow their syllabus. Placements are also plenty for KMIT college. Students get placed in top companies in Hyderabad. There\u2019s a branch called placement cell which deals all the placements of KMIT. If you have further doubts you can visit  http://kmit.ac.in  the official webite of KMIT. If you are joining KMIT I am looking forward to it. If you have any doubts comment down in the box and all the best choose your college wisely. Yup ,KMIT is in top 10 colleges. Placements are good, many companies come to our college for taking interviews. Alright don't worry about the placement but I'm sure that you will definitely gain knowledge on your subject as well logical thinking. All The Best . Have a Great Day AHead.",

        "a": "Learning to use an EQ properly is like learning a musical instrument. It takes much time, patience, and experimentation. We use EQ\u2019s for many purposes, and it helps to define categories. However, problems people solve with EQ\u2019s should often be solved a different way: changing the original sounds. I\u2019ll explain that at the end of this answer. Reasons and methods for using an EQ: Creating extra headroom by removing unnecessary overlapping frequencies. You mention you\u2019re good at using lowpass and highpass filters. That\u2019s great. With most electronic music, if a sound is not either the kick or the low bass, there\u2019s no reason a sound should contribute frequencies from 20\u2013150 hz. So, you can highpass every sound that isn\u2019t the kick or the bass. You already understand this, according to your comment. But what about generalizing this idea? Let\u2019s use a specific example. Suppose you have a kick drum. It has a low frequency punch somewhere from 60\u2013100hz, and a bit of bite at 4000 hz (which, let\u2019s assume, helps it cut through the mix a bit). But you also have a bunch of other synths playing; they coincide with the kick. The transients of those synths has strong content at 750\u2013850hz. Then the kick drum\u2019s frequencies at 750\u2013850hz might serve no musical purpose at all: there\u2019s already punch in that range from the synths that masks the kick\u2019s contribution in that same range. So, remove frequencies from the kick drum in the 750\u2013850hz range. Now there\u2019s more headroom for those other instruments which are more important. You should apply this process always to every sound in your entire track. You\u2019ll end up with a cleaner sound, instruments that complement each other better, and more overall headroom. Sound design/being creative. This method isn\u2019t about helping an instrument fit into a mix. It\u2019s just about turning one sound into a different sound. Go as crazy as you like with any combination of EQ\u2019s to turn one sound into a different one. It has nothing to do with mixing. You\u2019re just doing sound design work to your heart\u2019s content. It is critical to note that there are NO RULES HERE. Go crazy. This is the most often correct use case for using an EQ to boost, rather than cut frequencies. Making two different sounds fit together better. A good example here might be shakers and hi-hats. They both have a lot of high frequency content, and they can cause weird phase issues when played at the same time. So, maybe you remove frequencies from 4\u201310 khz on the shakers, and you remove frequencies from 10\u201320 khz on the hi-hats. You might be able to temper the issue a little bit this way. As for particular techniques for implementing these strategies, you should come up whatever helps your ears the most. Here are two that work well for me: a) Define a single narrow band and boost it by about 20 db. (strong boost). Then, slowly move the frequency of that narrow, boosted band around the spectrum so you can hone your ears in on what it is you\u2019re tweaking. Once you find the problem area, or the are that is conflicting most with other sounds, you can then reduce that frequency accordingly, and perhaps widen the Q value so it sounds a bit more natural. It is extremely normal and acceptable to use this process for lots of different bands on any given sound. b) Try applying a similar \u201cnarrow it down\u201d process to the entire mix! Put an EQ on your master channel. Put both a low and high-pass filter across the whole mix. Now, listen to your mix within a small band like 500\u20131000hz. You\u2019ll more easily discern which sounds conflict within that narrow range. However, as I alluded to at the start, another (better) way to solve problems 1 and 3 is not during the mixing phase. You EQ using methods 1 and 3 to fix problems. But what caused those problems in the first place? Let\u2019s do another example. Say you\u2019re adding a synth-line melody to a track. When you add it on top of the rest of the tracks, the rest of the tracks maybe sound ill-defined. Some of them may even vanish altogether (maybe a hi-hat line goes from prominent to basically non-existent - the synth has completely masked it). Consider two ways to solve this problem: either you can vigorously EQ by applying methods I\u2019ve mentioned above. Or, you can re-think the problem entirely! Why are the world\u2019s best chefs able to make the world\u2019s best food? One reason is that they use the freshest ingredients, and that they use ingredients which are natural complements. Imagine you gave the world\u2019s most talented chef the following items: orange juice, moldy bread, and a month-old rotting octopus. Is there any chance the chef could create something palatable, much less delicious? Probably not. On the other hand, if you have fresh tomato, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, salt, pepper, and some olive oil, you can give those ingredients to a 10-year-old who can\u2019t even cook, and you\u2019d still end up with a salad that tastes almost as good as the world class chef\u2019s. I cannot over-emphasize this analogy with regard to EQ\u2019ing. Most of the time we struggle to use an EQ to get our sounds working better together, we\u2019re making a mistake. The problem is not as it seems. We are not bad at EQ\u2019ing. Instead, we just chose an imperfect combination of ingredients. The solution is to go back to the garden and pick new ingredients. Search for sounds that complement each other naturally. Design sounds from scratch that complement others you already have, and EQ adjustments will become subtle or even unnecessary. A confusing point: remember that part of this \u201cget fresher ingredients\u201d process may involve EQ technique #2 above. Rule #2 is not EQ\u2019ing to help \u201cfit into the mix\u201d; it\u2019s just changing the underlying ingredient. So make sure not to conflate the two ideas. Avoiding lots of EQ\u2019ing by using fresh ingredients is not to say \u201cdon\u2019t overuse EQ\u2019s\u201d but rather, \u201cdon\u2019t frustratedly use EQ\u2019s to make octopus and orange juice somehow work together.\u201d How do you cut and mix music? What is the best hardware eq for mastering electronic dance music? What volume should I mix music at? Where can I learn to mix music better? Why do people like electronic music? Well, lowpass and highpass are usually a good place to start. In electronic music especially, hipassing everything usually works miracles in cleaning up a mix, especially if you\u2019ve chosen your instrument and synth sounds carefully. After that, start listening to combinations of two or three tracks, and listen for where they \u201coverlap\u201d in terms of frequency. Are your pads fighting with your lead for dominance around 1000hz? Are your vocals and your lead overlapping at 4000hz? Judicious (and usually small) cuts here and there help make individual instruments sound clearer. If you\u2019ve got an EQ that lets you solo a band, use that as a tool to find out where you\u2019ve got a frequency that \u201chonks\u201d in your mix. Or if you don\u2019t, crank up the gain on a band, and sweep it across the frequency spectrum and wherever it sounds worst, switch it from high-gain to a slight cut. Meters and analyzers can help here too - if you\u2019re not good yet at  hearing  where it stacks up, you can often  see  the trouble spots on an analyzer. Also it may be worthwhile to learn where the various fundamentals of your instruments are; where the snare\u2019s \u201cpunch\u201d and \u201cair\u201d come from, where the kick\u2019s \u201cthud\u201d and \u201cclick\u201d are, etc, so you know where you probably don\u2019t want to cut (or may even want to boost). In a lot of the mixes I get from clients, there\u2019s usually a bit of frequency mud around 200\u2013300hz, so I often start there. Your mileage may vary, but low midrange is often a particular trouble spot. Sound choice makes a difference, too. As does arrangement. If you use a ton of big, full-frequency, fat sounds all together, they\u2019re going to conflict and sound like mush. If you constrain things correctly, things actually sound fuller. Just the other day I got a mix from a client that had almost no EQ on the individual tracks beyond highpass, but he\u2019d chosen his instrument sounds and done his arrangement so meticulously that there was virtually no EQ needed. One trick that used to be popular is layering similar sounds with very radical EQ. I see it most often done with guitars, but it works with synths too; taking a big sound, cutting the crap out of the low and high end, then mixing it with a slightly different sound with the high and low cut at different points, so it\u2019s almost like individual solo\u2019ed bands of an EQ all playing together, except it tricks the ear into thinking you\u2019ve got all these giant sounds all playing at the same time. Shoegazer bands do this with distorted guitars a lot. Of course the real answer to everything is \u201cuse your ears.\u201d All the tips and tricks in the world can\u2019t beat just messing around and listening for what sounds good to you. Excellent answers so far. I\u2019ll just add a couple of extra tips regarding EQ. Consider using dynamic EQ to help shape a sound and bring it out of the mix or bury it as needed. For example, let\u2019s say you have an acid lead that on it\u2019s own is quite upfront and overwhelms another synth. Automate the EQ such that the acid sits back when the synth comes in and vice versa. You can also apply this to vocals. Again using EQ push the vocal back by cutting higher frequencies, but when you want the vocal to move up front, bring those back in. For those that stumble upon this question, you can also use panning as an \u201cEQ tool.\u201d Two competing sounds with a similar frequency profile can coexist if you pan them \u201caway from each other\u201d. Eg synth 1 goes to L15, R15 and synth 2 goes to L25,R25. Keeping track of where frequencies are sitting in the stereo field will help you avoid clashing/overlapping sounds and give your track more clarity. Answers from other people cover most of it, but to answer one specific question: \u201cHow do I find the frequencies I should be removing?\u201d The first question is, why should you remove frequencies? What are you trying to achieve? In general, you\u2019ll EQ when a part, or a combination of parts, have too much going on in a certain area. For example, if your hihats are too sharp and fizzy, you might remove some of your high frequencies. Alternatively, if you have a very bassy kick drum and a low bass line, you may find that these parts clash with each other. In that case, use a spectral analyser (eg Ableton\u2019s Spectrum, or Span) to find which frequency the kick drum is hitting at. You can then reduce that frequency in the bass line to create a gap for the kick drum to poke through. Gonna be blunt here-apologies in advance but if you have to ask that question you do not know \u201ca lot\u201d about mixing. Having said that, the art of mixing is such a complex science that it takes people years of purely mixing to get to a stage where they do in fact know a lot. There's a couple of kinda basic things that will partially answer your question (I say basic because they're very foundational, and because every song is different and has different ranges of dominant frequencies you may have to dig deeper than these) Firstly, the easy one is you need to be able to identify which frequencies sound cluttered or muddy. This typically happens when you have a number of instruments/sounds fighting for the same frequencies. In electronic music a common one would be your kicks and basses overlapping, but it can also happen anywhere else on the frequency spectrum. You can make the overall mix sound clearer by cutting out some of the overlapping frequencies from whatever it is that doesn't need to be the primary point of focus when you hear it (with kicks and basses you can also sidechain the bass to the kick so that the volume/eq/compression/whatever else dips when the kick hits) Another useful tip is what I personally call \u201cSurgical EQ\u201d. In essense, put a an eq on whatever instrument you want to clean up, and boost a very narrow range of frequencies. Move up and down the spectrum, listening out for imperfections, or any kind of noise, and when you find something, simply cut it. I'd strongly suggest watching some videos on YouTube so you can hear examples of what you need to be looking for. But seriously, like I said earlier, mixing is a science. There's plenty of great material online, YouTube is always a great start.",

By the late 1960s that was up to 25 inches, and in the late 1970s projection screen TV s hit the market. Each time there was an enlargement of the screen, or a change in technology (color TVs rapidly replaced B&W in the sixties), more TVs were purchased. In the early 1960s, 90% of American households had one TV. 30 years later, there were  more TVs than people in the US. Manufacturers will increase screen size if there is a sufficient market to sell larger TVs. Or 3D TVs. Or smart TVs, personal TVs or surround sound. Or interactive TVs. Or whatever it takes. Sell. How are TV sizes measured? How do all sizes differ from each other? Has the quality of movies vs TV shows increased more slowly? What is the size of the HDMI input on a Hitachi TV?

Your drawing is good! It\u2019s pretty stylistic (pointillism, I think it\u2019s called), which makes it less realistic. However, if you\u2019d like to continue with this style and still try to draw realistically, it\u2019s not completely impossible. For instance: (Courtesy of Google Images) Pointillism takes time. A  lot  of time, but it looks really cool when it\u2019s finished. One quick point of advice: try  gridding . It\u2019ll help you focus on individual parts of a picture and draw attention to details. You\u2019re on the right track! Just practice often, and don\u2019t get discouraged if your picture doesn\u2019t look exactly like your reference. What are some mind blowing drawings you have seen? How do I draw a human face? Are there any videos that show me how to draw a realistic pig? How do you draw a realistic nose? How good is my first semi-realistic drawing? Thanks for the A2A! Well, realistic drawing does not include dot drawing. To convey a realistic impression to the viewer one must mimic reality, and reality is not dotted\u2026 Take a look at this:  Home And good luck! Yes you will. Everyone starts somewhere. I myself had stopped drawing for 3\u20134 years and started again when i got inspired seeing some artists\u2019 drawings on instagram. This was my first drawing after the no-drawing gap of 3 years. (cringe) It is very understandable to be unsatisfied with the output. I surely was. Just have full confidence in your skills and keep practicing. Try to draw one portrait every week. Have the photograph printed in front of you while you draw since it will make things easier. Start with simple pencil and charcoal drawings. To make things easier, get the reference photograph printed in black and white as well. Have faith in yourself, be patient and don\u2019t give up. These are a few of my recent(not exactly) works. I haven\u2019t sketched in a while. Also, this answer might help you :  Prerna Panesar's answer to How can I learn to draw portraits? Have a great day and be sure to share your artworks with me :D Let me tell you, everyone can draw. Drawing realistic is imitation. And according to Plato, Art is an imitation of an imitation. Imitation requires close observation. If I say can you imitate a paper craft by looking at at. Lets take a simple example of paper plane. First you try to make it by looking at it. It doesn't come well. You unfold it and observe closely. Next you again fold it. Same thing happens with realistic drawing. You draw something. It doesn't look like that person. You closely observe why is it not looking like that? You get an answer \"oh I have made the nose shorter\", \"the eyes are not aligned\", \"cheeks seem little chubbier here\". Now you go and fix them. Just Draw, Draw, and Draw. You will see the progress in few days. watch live demo of realistic drawing on YouTube, read books. There is no reason you wont be able to draw realistic. Only if you practice and get critiques. You also have to learn to draw from observation, if you don't already. This means drawing what your eyes see, and not what your mind imagines you are seeing, because your mind will exaggerate it in some way either making something smaller or bigger than it really is. You'll never get better if you don't practice a lot, and you'll never start out good. Da Vinci was probably shit when he started, but look at him now, one of the most famous artists of all time.",

My tips for you: Master your camera Always study your niches of interest (there\u2019s endless free resources online) Begin photographing the important events of friends and family as a gift Understand the rules and laws of photography by picking up the book by ASMP titled Professional Business Practices in Photography Put together a price list that you are comfortable with Put it out there on any local and social media site you are on Maintain professionalism on any shoot Repeat as many steps as needed These are most of the steps that I took when first starting out in professional photography seven years ago. To learn more about my online beta course for beginners and intermediate photographers,  click here . Is there any career in professional fashion photograph? What are the steps to be a photographer? How do I start a career as a freelance photographer? How does one become a hacker? How do I start a career as a wildlife photographer? Which institutes should I attend? That's easy\u2026.. get paid for it! in all seriousness, it's a tough and very long road which is becoming ever more narrow. In truth, to be the best of the best you have to be at the top of your game and make sure that is better than anybody else's game. The truth is, you likely won't be - none of us will be. But there is hope, the sad fact is that quality barely plays into your ability to be a professional photographer. I know many people making a satisfactory living as a photographer (that is to say 100% of their wage is from photography) who are terrible. Be it in eCommerce, weddings, portraits\u2026 photographers know quality (some of them) but the general public don't and don't mug care. As long as they have a reasonably exposed photo of themselves, 8/10 times theyre happy. the sad fact of it is, if you want to be a professional photographer, you have to be an excellent marketer. Marketing is the key to photography in this age and a great social media/online brand is what will get you there. lower your rates and you may well offend photographers, but you will have an audience who will buy it. Spend every waking hour on Facebook groups replying to anybody who wants a photographer\u2026 along with 100\u2019s of other photographers. its not a glamorous profession and if you enjoy photography as a hobby - most jobs you can have in the industry will likely dull that. if you still want to become a pro, and let\u2019s say you mean shooting world famous models in exotic locations, learn how to use your camera. find your own style (that's what sells you the best to the people who know what to look for) and improve it. Approach model agencies for testing with the new faces and hope to God that someone is there at the right time, right place likes your stuff. Ifyou're talking about weddings or events or portraits\u2026 just start doing more of it and market the hell out of it - spam social media. good luck I)Stop spending time on Quora and photography related websites and social media II. ) Join ASMP, PPA, or APA. But together a portfolio f your very best iamges. Do not rely on your own judgement as to which these are. Ask or hire an art director or professional photo editor to help you with this AND LISTEN TO THEIR ADVICE. Make a budget. Do your best to stick to it. Never, ever buy equipment on credit. III) Get help developing a marketing plan. -Buy a website domain with your name. -Get business cards printed. These do not have to be anything fancy but the design should be nice and the card intriguing. - Buy a mailing list relevent to the typeo f work you want to do in the region you are located. -Go to your local Art Director, Advertising, and Graphic Arts professional groups. Join and volunteer. collect business cards. -Get post cards printed. Send them put to people yo uwant to see, saying yopu want to meet them. -Get your portfolio printed and find a folio for it. (if they are still in business, I really like  lost-luggage.com ) -Go see people who you think will need your services. -send them thank you notes. IV). Repeat step III especially after it starts yielding results. That is a very large question the answer to which will depend on how you answer several questions How old are you and how much education do you have Do you have any professional traning or experience How much do you know about the business of photography Do you do photography as a hobby. If so what sort of work do you do and how good are you at it. What kind of equipment do you own and do you know ho wto get the most out of it. Ho who you plan to promote yourself How do you plan to get clients DO you have a business plan Do you have a budget Can you afford to live for a year without drawing a salary if necessary Basically, the answers to these questions will help you learnn what you need to do to start your career. This assumes you have a general working knowledge of photography and can compete on a technical and creative level with others in the business. If you get back to me with the answers to these questions I will try to point you in the right direction. Good luck on this excelent journey\u2026",

Of course, people blame anything for anything, so why not blame God too, but the event would never happen. The 2004 tsunami in Sumatra was probably blamed on some gods by some people, so was the 2011 tsunami in Japan (the one that nearly wrecked the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. But they were caused by the way the planet is built. Tectonic plates don\u2019t slice smoothly, so when one gets stuck for a while, then finally lets go, we get a huge earthquake, and that can cause a huge flood. But one that would flood half the world would probably wipe out  all  life, so there\u2019d be no one left to blame any god. The world is going to end. God can only save 5 people on earth. Who would he save? If God told you (and others) to build arks to save humanity from another flood, would you do it? Mass of car is about 10^30 AMU, mass of Earth about 10^51 AMU. 30 is more than half of 51. Is mass of Earth tiny? Is the gay population in the US less than 2 percent, or are most too cowardly to speak up? What will happen if the population of the earth becomes half? If i were religious, I certainly would blame god. According to the Old Testament, its already happened once, and he promised never to do it again. Thats the noahic covenant. So, if it does flood again, we know god is an oath breaker, and certainly not worthy of praise or worship. Off course God would get the blame. God is in control of weather right? So considering after the flood with Noah God promised never to do that again. So if humans who knows better continue with their current ways and cause global warming and global warming causes such a flood, would you still ask if God could be at blame. God gave us earth. Adam and Eve in their dissobedience gave us knowledge. We used that knowledge to better our lifes for comfort and in turn we are destroying our planet. Is that God's fault? No thats our fault. So if such a flood xid come. We certainly have no one to blame but ourselves. Then the qeustion would be, why didn'd God stop it before it killed so many people. The answer is why do parents punish their children for misbehaving? If God fixed our mistakes we would never learn and conrinue to make those mistakes. So by allowing the flood God will actually be helping us more. As noted earlier, God will not destroy the earth again by water, which is why we have the rainbow as part of the Noachian covenant, but there is still a judgment yet to come on man where men will blame God. This is the Great Tribulation when the fifth bowl judgment is unleashed on unrepentant man, and they will blaspheme God during it.",

        "a": "Maybe the small wonders can rejuvenate you, just being among the townsfolk in particular. For example, I recommend San Marcelino and Olongapo, Zambales, in western Central Luzon. San Marcelino: (Reminds one of the French countryside a little.) Olongapo: The views in both towns (well, city for Olongapo) are decent (the dramatic mountain settings add to it), the camaraderie is beautiful (the public markets are the best examples), and the atmosphere is generally an even mix of bustle and stillness. Plus, there\u2019s the nearby town of San Antonio, with its Pundaquit neighborhood\u2019s gorgeous beaches. They\u2019re not exactly Cannes, or Zihuatanejo, but they have great sunsets and a sheltered, cloistered coziness about them. I\u2019m not particularly a novelty person, just a person who recommends subtlety and atmosphere, so though I\u2019m not sure that those places are amazing things to see, they definitely are relaxing and rejuvenating things to  experience . What things do Americans miss most while traveling abroad - and take for granted while at home? Has anybody been to Cebu in the Philippines? Why do some foreigners like to come and stay in the Philippines, but many Filipinos want to leave? I am going to Jamaica for 3 weeks. I want to travel around the island. What is the best way to do that? What is a good two-week itinerary for visiting the Philippines? Not amazing I\u2019m afraid. There are not many amazing things to see in the beaches in the Philippines. Hear this. This country is a nation of islands. Wherever you go, you will always end up in a beach. That is not spectacular or amazing. That is just a regular occurrence on a day to day basis. For one full week, you wil have a dose (overdose) of beaches, and more beaches (the spelling is correct). My Australian friend visited our place one time, and we told him it is great he has a month vacation every year to travel to a different country. We don\u2019t have such luxury. He replied, it is true he has a month to leave his place and experience paradise. But we live in paradise all year long. The best islands are the less inhabited ones. There are way too many of these. So just go and explore. In front of our old house in a serene peaceful place in Pagadian, there is an island itself. It is not inhabited and people only go there to just relax, eat any seafood available, bask and swim. No entrance fee, no waiter, no gate, no nothing. Just you and the island all to yourself. It is not best for us. But it might be to you. Go see for yourself. If you have a week to visit this country by virtue of its gorgeous islands, I suggest you stay in one place and exhaust it. No. Not Boracay. I hear you. And no, not Palawan. Not even Cebu. Not Camiguin, Not Surigao, Not Siargao, Not Siquijor, Not Bohol, Not Dumaguete. None of the above. Go to Samal. It\u2019s an island in front of Davao City. Just stay there and relax. The week will go by full of rich thoughts of beauty. Travelers usually go to those more famous islands I mentioned above. So if you wish to join them, just go join \u2018em. If you are a different kind of traveler who wish to experience island life lived by the locals. Go south. Or farther north. Cebu is overrated. Or perhaps fast becoming overrated. If you want to experience Cebu, spend a night or two and move on. But if you find a good reason to stay for a while, then stay. These places may sound like small because of the word island. But it takes days to discover what one island has to offer and no two islands are the same. Hello from sunny manila! I\u2019m thrilled you\u2019re thinking about heading to the Philippines! I love this country to bits, and i\u2019m sure this place will treat you well. Cebu isn\u2019t overrated. In fact, it\u2019s one of the hottest travel destinations in the Philippines. If serene white sands and lovely city folk is what you\u2019re after, this gem\u2019s the one for you. I could go on, but this is something you have to experience for yourself. I\u2019ve got the perfect plan for you, head on over to this link. Hope all works well! https://philihappy.com/cebu-itin... Cebu is not overrated. If you are in the Philippines, Cebu would be a great place to visit. It has a huge major city and provincial places. The food also is incredible.

It gives a satisfaction that I have invested that time in a activity that I like and that time must have enhanced my drawing skills.this also give me motivation that I have something to be proud off.

        "a": "What is vomiting blood (haematemesis)? The medical word for vomiting blood is haematemesis. This symptom is usually due to a problem within the upper gut. That is, the gullet (oesophagus), stomach or the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). There is a range of different causes - discussed below. Vomiting of blood is a medical emergency . In many cases the bleeding will stop quite quickly but in some cases it can become severe and life-threatening. Therefore, call an ambulance or go directly to the nearest emergency department if you vomit blood. Understanding the upper gut Your gut (gastrointestinal tract) is the tube that starts at your mouth, and ends at your bottom (anus). The upper gut includes the gullet (oesophagus), stomach and first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Food passes down the oesophagus into the stomach. The stomach makes acid which is not essential but helps to digest food. After being mixed in the stomach, food passes into the duodenum, to be digested. Some types of bleeding from the upper gut The type of bleeding is sometimes described as follows: Dark blood . This is often referred to as a 'coffee ground' colour. This suggests that the bleed has been relatively slow. The blood has been in contact with stomach acid long enough for the acid to turn the blood a dark brown/red colour. The bleeding in this situation may not yet have been heavy. However, it may become heavy at a later time. A large amount of bright red blood  suggests a rapid and large bleed. Melaena  is the medical word for old, dark blood in poo (stools/faeces). If you have  melaena , your stools become very dark or black. There is often a tar-like consistency. Vomiting blood and having melaena are symptoms that often go together. Having both symptoms together means that you have had a lot of bleeding into the gut. Other symptoms may occur at the same time as vomiting blood. For example, tummy (abdominal) pain, high temperature (fever), feeling unwell, or other gut symptoms. If you lose a lot of blood, it can make you feel dizzy or even pass out. The presence and type of other symptoms may help to point to a cause of the bleeding. Sometimes there are no other symptoms at first. What are the causes of vomiting blood? There are many possible causes. Below is a brief overview of the more common and important causes: Bleeding from the gullet (oesophagus) Causes include: Oesophageal varices . Varices are enlarged, swollen blood vessels in the lining of the gullet or stomach.  They are one of the possible complications of liver cirrhosis . In cirrhosis, scarred liver tissue blocks blood flow through the liver. This causes an increase in pressure in the vein that takes blood from the gut to the liver (the portal vein). The increased pressure pushes back into the gut and causes the veins to swell in the gullet. The swellings are quite fragile and may bleed heavily into the gullet. Inflammation of the oesophagus   (oesophagitis) is often due to acid reflux from the stomach (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)) . The inflamed oesophagus sometimes bleeds. Oesophageal cancer  sometimes causes bleeding into the oesophagus . Mallory-Weiss syndrome  is bleeding caused by a tear in the lining of the oesophagus or stomach . The tear can be caused by anything that leads to a sudden rise in pressure in the stomach or the oesophagus. For example, repeated retching or vomiting, excessive straining, violent coughing or hiccupping. Bleeding from the stomach Causes include: Stomach (gastric) ulcer . An ulcer is a small hole in the lining of the stomach. An ulcer may bleed, sometimes heavily. There are several causes of stomach ulcers, including: Infection  with a germ (bacterium) called  Helicobacter pylori . This can usually be treated quite easily. Anti-inflammatory medicines  that are used to treat conditions such as arthritis, sometimes cause stomach ulcers. Aspirin, used commonly to prevent blood clots. Stress. Stomach cancer  sometimes causes bleeding into the stomach . Inflammation of the stomach lining  (gastritis) has similar causes to stomach ulcers . Varices  in the lining of the stomach may occur similar to oesophageal varices described above. Mallory-Weiss syndrome  may affect the lining of the stomach - described above. Bleeding from the first part of the small intestine (duodenum) Causes include: Duodenal ulcer . An ulcer may bleed, sometimes heavily. Like stomach ulcers, a duodenal ulcer is usually caused by an infection with the germ (bacterium) called  H. pylori . This can usually be treated quite easily. Anti-inflammatory medicines and aspirin, which are common causes of stomach ulcers, are uncommon causes of duodenal ulcers. Inflammation of the duodenum lining  (duodenitis) has similar causes to duodenal ulcers. Rare causes from any part of the upper gut Include: Radiation poisoning . Uncommon infections of the gut . Injury . No cause identified . Even after tests, in some cases the cause cannot be found. Bleeding which has not come from the gut Sometimes when blood is vomited, it has not come from the gut. For example, if you have had a  nosebleed  and then swallowed the blood, you may vomit blood. Also sometimes it can be difficult to tell whether the blood has been vomited up from the gut, or coughed up What tests may be needed? A doctor's assessment Your doctor is likely to ask various questions about the nature of the bleeding and ask if you have any other symptoms. He or she will also examine you. The doctor will try to find out if this blood is truly coming from the upper gut. Sometimes it is difficult to be sure. Sometimes it can be difficult to say if the blood is: Haemoptysis - that is, if the blood is coughed up, not vomited up . Coming from somewhere in your mouth or nose that tracks to the back of your throat, which you then swallow and vomit back up. For example, from a nosebleed. The doctor will also try to make a judgement about how much blood you have lost and how serious this is. They will be able to tell this from what you tell them and also by checking your pulse and blood pressure. If it is clear that the blood is coming from the upper gut, tests are usually done to identify the cause. Blood tests Blood tests  will usually be done to assess your general situation.  For example, how much blood you have lost,  and if you need intravenous fluid or a blood transfusion to counter any large amount of blood loss. Also,  blood tests may help to assess your liver function  if you have 'scarring' of the liver (cirrhosis), or to help diagnose or assess other causes of the bleeding. Gastroscopy A gastroscopy (endoscopy) is an internal examination. A thin, flexible telescope is passed down the gullet (oesophagus) into the stomach and to the upper duodenum . The cause of the bleeding can often be identified by endoscopy. What is the treatment for vomiting blood? Initial treatment The initial treatment may require a drip into a vein to give you fluid or even  a blood transfusion  if the bleeding is severe. This may not be necessary if the bleeding has been minor and has stopped. However, if the bleeding is severe, full resuscitation and emergency fluid/blood replacement may be required. Other treatments This will depend on the cause. However, an initial treatment to stop any ongoing bleeding can often be done by using instruments that can be passed down the endoscope (as described above). Occasionally, emergency surgery is needed to control severe ongoing bleeding. Once bleeding is stopped, further treatment depends on the cause. For details, see individual leaflets on the various diseases that can cause vomiting blood. here\u2019s link for reference Causes, Symptoms and Treatments Vomiting Blood - Symptoms, Causes, Treatments NY Times Health Information Why did I vomit blood after I drank? What causes me to throw up blood? Why do people vomit after drinking too much? How can it be avoided? Why am I spitting up blood when pregnant? What causes me to throw up acid? Even your doctors would have needed to run tests and scans to arrive at why you are throwing up blood. How can anyone on Quora, know for sure, despite you stating you have MND? There\u2019s quite a few types of MND out there; even knowing which one no doctor will be able to just look at you and tell exactly why. What I don\u2019t understand is why you didn\u2019t go to your doctor earlier. You could have directed him/her to not tell your parents anything or gone to a different one. I am assuming you are not too financially badly off seeing as how this actually got diagnosed, so it looks like you have one. Secondly if this gets worse, your parents and friends will find out anyway. Don\u2019t you think they will be more worried when your problems amplify later because you neglected them while they were solvable? Well, child, they will be in far more difficulty because you thought you were sparing their feelings first. They\u2019ll actually feel worse later and more guilty seeing how \u2018considerate\u2019 you were. They\u2019ll wonder whether they were so \u2018bad\u2019 to you that you wanted to spare them. So do everyone a favor and get off Quora and talk to your doctor  soon. You are 21, for Christ sake! Head towards a medical doctor, get investigated.The inevitable ( made me chuckle!) is road to recovery. I presume, MND stands for Motor Neurone Disease (not specified). Confide with a family or friend, you might need financial assistance for investigation if you are not independent. Early diagnosis aids in better treatment & speedy recovery.On contrary, your symptoms could be minor ailment. Best wishes. My dear friend, what do you mean by inevitable? And why can't you tell your friends and family? Note that you are younger than my daughter who's a student. So, I can talk to you like a and as a parent. Please understand that it would hurt them terribly forever that their child didn't share his pain and illness with them. Please do talk to your parents immediately. I cannot guide you medically, however, be sure to find moral and psychological support from me. You could reach me through Quora or through mail at  j.umashankara@gmail.com Please immediately consult your family physician and or a good general surgeon. Make this promise to yourself; for you, your parents and all those you meet and grew up with. Think of all that you should achieve. Be bold and sure that you will overcome the illness and become a great addition to good people of this earth Share this to your parents because if your health deteriorates then they'll get more worried. Visit your doctor and seek help. You don't have to suffer.",

Until, I assume, someone figured out that mailing large quantities of powder like material in the US Post wasn\u2019t the best idea. In short, I don\u2019t know of any good solution. You can get a lot by vacuuming with a bagged vacuum, but the stuff can stick, especially to bodies, and takes forever to come off. Clear packing tape can pick up some of the harder pockets, but once it has spread it will take forever to get it all. I have friends with glitter permanently stuck into the finishes of tables and other furnishings. Years from now you\u2019ll still be finding it. Good luck. How do I get rid of dots of paint spools/spills on floor tiles? How do I get rid of the odour of varnish applied on tiles? I have to construct a new home. Which is better for flooring, marble, granite, or tiles? What is the safest way to get rid of asbestos floor tiles? What are some ways to remove dried cement from the floor tiles? Is it possible to get rid of glitter once it's all over the house and tile floor? Not really. You can get quite a bit with a lint roller and shop vac. But I doubt you can get it all. Glitter is the herpes of the craft world. There is no cure. Fire may be the only sure option. Short of burning the house down try a commercial cleaning company. They can steam clean everything and get most of the glitter off but somehow it seems to multiply and may come back.",

        "a": "Leaky Gut Syndrome  (LGS) is a major cause of disease and dysfunction in modern society. In Leaky Gut Syndrome, the  epithelium  on the villi of the small intestine becomes  inflamed and irritated , which allows toxins from the small intestines to flood into the blood stream. This may compromise the liver, the lymphatic system, and the immune response including the endocrine system. It is often the primary cause of:  asthma ,  food allergies ,  chronic sinusitis ,  eczema ,  urticaria ,  migraine ,  irritable bowel ,  fungal disorders ,  fibromyalgia , and  rheumatoid arthritis . It also contributes to  PMS ,  uterine fibroid , and  breast fibroid ,  chronic fatigue syndrome  and  pediatric immune deficiencies . In Chinese Medicine, we look at specific conditions in terms of  pattern diagnosis  as well as  symptoms differentiation . This means we take the Western diagnosis of LGS one step further to create a more personalized treatment plan for each individual patient since it manifests differently in every single case. Usually,  wheat  or  grains  are not causing leaky gut but are only triggering inflammation of the gut lining if it is not protected by strong microbiome. Wheat is considered medicine in cases with extreme dryness and deficiency, otherwise not advised. Let\u2019s say, you\u2019ve been on rounds of antibiotics as a child or as an adult. This tends to create a very  Cold  environment in the digestive system. Your  ability to digest  and  absorb nutrients  can become compromised,  yeast overgrowth  can occur as a result of killing off beneficial bacteria. This can result in symptoms such as  weight gain ,  muscle loss ,  bloating ,  fatigue ,  sinus congestion ,  diarrhea , and  irritable bowel syndrome . A Chinese Medicine practitioner will usually identify these symptoms as a  Spleen Qi and Yang deficiency , which basically means your  digestive  and  immune systems  have become  weakened . Acupuncture and herbs that benefit  Spleen Qi  and  Yang  may be recommended. We usually recommend patients with leaky gut following treatment plan: REMOVAL  of wrong foods like  corn ,  soy ,  wheat ,  dairy ,  gluten ,  eggs ,  sugar ,  nightshades REPLACING  a bad diet with whole foods, digestive enzymes, Chinese Herbs, and amino acids REINOCULATING  the intestinal microbiome with prebiotics, probiotics, and fermented foods REPAIRING  the gut with substances such as L-glutamine, glycine, bone broth, colostrum, and Chinese Herbs At the same time they receive tonifying and strengthening acupuncture treatments to support Spleen function. Is sauerkraut considered healthy in Chinese Medicine? Why do we rely too much on western medicine? How do I study Chinese medicine? What are the pros and cons of western medicine? Why do people trust Western medicine so much? Leaky gut is not an medicinal term. So there is no such thing in modern medicine. Grains being rich with Gliadin could give you some gastrointestinal upset, like vomit, diarrhea, belly ache, etc. only if you are allergic or intolerant to Gliadin. If you don\u2019t have such problem, you have nothing to worry about. And it is not all grain containing Gliadin, mainly grains like wheat, barly, oat,rye. Others grains like rice, corn have no Gliadin or very little Gliadin. About Chinese medicine, I don\u2019t really know much, but I don\u2019t think grain is considered healthy or unhealthy in Chinese medicine. It is a kind of food, and that is all. And also, Gliadin allergy or intolerance is extremely uncommon in China. Grains dont cause \u201cleaky gut\u201d in Western medicine. They are generally considered healthy by Western medicine and are recommended to be part of a healthy nutritious diet. There is such a thing as coeliac disease, which is an, often genetically, autoimmune disorder that shows in about 1% of the (Dutch) population and is probably triggered by an allergic reaction to gliadin, a substance that is found in some grains. Gliadin is present in wheat, spelt, rye, barley and durum, but not in corn or rice. The disease can cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain, abdominal distension and mouth ulcers. It might cause a degree of lactose intolerance and possibly adenocarcinoma and lymphoma as well.",

They work & spent remaining time of ride & ride related jtems. A lot of them have YouTube channels. Larger the views more the money. Reviews about new motorcycles.

They test new motorcycles before they hit the open market for sales, giving them clear idea about end user. Selling merchandise - popular riders have a known name & face.

Even worse is when real nutjobs get inspired by these scenes and imitate them in real life with often terrible consequences. What are some of the mind-blowing facts about the Baahubali movie? What are the lessons learned from Baahubali 2? What is the release date of the Baahubali 2 movie? Is the end of the movie Baahubali justified? Is Baahubali 2 a good film? Good question indeed. I felt the same way, though did like the out of the box thinking and creative expression behind it.  Undressing a woman is certainly not justifiable, whatever or however the motive behind it be.  Besides, what irked me apart from it is that the whole scene and some of its related predecessors only emphasized \u2018the set rules for how a woman should be\u2019. It portrayed this undying psyche of people to define ways of living or being a certain way for women. Why can\u2019t women not care how they look or what they wear and only focus on their wants? Why should they always be charming, or rather \u2018feminine\u2019 as defined by the society.  Didn\u2019t this scene narrate the same, or is it just me who felt it this way? Very Good Question!!! I saw many people in Quora talking about the below scene. There are many comments about this scene stating \u2018excellent\u2019 \u2018fantastic\u2019 \u2018spectacular\u2019. Some said Bahubali is movie on women empowerment. But no one talked about the scene where Prabhas removes Thamannah clothes I say it(Bahubali) is yet another masala movie which tell if hero touches heroine without her permission then it is cool!!! Same did by any villan or side-role so un-cool. I request audience please dont judge a movie by a single scene. Analyse complete movie. PS: Im a big fan of Bahubali. Except that particular scene. Cheers!! :) There is nothing wrong over there. Avantika (Tamannah) is mature enough to stop Shivudu while removing the clothes but she didn\u2019t. The reason may be she has some interest over Shivudu and allowed him to do so. Coming to the conclusion part, that is completely wrong behaviour towards a married woman and meanwhile they are hesitating to be done like that and Anushka well reacted. Moral : If both sides are Okay, there shouldn\u2019t be a third person Involvement. Let them do what they wanted to do. P.S Loved the Movie the way it is. No objections. @Abdul Rashid - Lol, There goes some secret consent from Avantika. If what you think is correct, Can\u2019t Avantika Deal the scene when a guy tries to rape her? Atleast can\u2019t she push him away? I better suggest watch the movie with feel. Btw Maturity is not what you think, it\u2019s what everyone feels. No argument.",

A young soldier leaving his loving parents at home, enlists for war and the brownish-red stain on his shirt, due to a wound on his chest small yet lethal, suggests nothing but the casualty and grief of war. Brothers in arms fought together, everyone but the young man sits there undead, yet not so alive, wondering what path led him here. The poet describes not the agony but the soldier\u2019s grief and disappointment, who has a small pain in his chest and a weak-faint smile asking for a sip of water. If this isn\u2019t the bad side of war then what is? The afternoon sun that gets dimmer by the second signifies that the soldier is going to pass out, and die. The poet then talks about a big metaphorical wound in his heart, crying while pressing the dead body of a young man against him, who had a small wound that lead to his demise. If this isn\u2019t anti-war poem then I don\u2019t know what is. ***",

        "a": "Under the moderation policy, examines are awarded up to 15% extra marks in board papers if the questions are found to be difficult . But recently CBSE scrapped off the moderation policy from practice . Here is the valid statement issued by them The moves come after CBSE had in requested the HRD ministry to help develop all the opinion among all the states board on completely removing the marks moderation policy which is considered as the reason behind inflated scores in board exam results . However, the practice of awarding grace will continue to ensure that a student clears an exam if he/she needs a few marks to do. Effects due to no moderation policy- The annual soaring cut-offs for admission in college will go down completely. If only CBSE implements this policy unilaterally , then its students will be in a disadvantageous position , so all state boards need to agreee. Now, maybe we do not get chance to see people scoring 99+ percentage. No typical dialogues will be heard ,\u201d  Sharma ji ka beta 98,99.2 lays hai\u201d (  the son of Mr. Sharma has scored 98,99% , now basically the gap will be narrower. Marks will not be completely realistic and genuine . Yeah it will affect the hope of many students, but now it will be completely fair and the all rounder student who gave its complete year dedicatedly to the studies , marks will be awarded accordingly to that . DU cut off will now not be so high that you may have to take several birth to accomplish that cut off . Yeah, it also true students hope for the Miracle and magic , in exam, we all have and will always wanted to get more we expected, but think about the after effects, Admission cut off, realistic percentages and finally getting in accordance to your efforts , you will be graded. No partiality, if one gets more marks than you as earlier in marking system of board exam. Your efforts and dedication will now sail your boat from one shore of board exam to shore of success and good marks. All the best guys, hope for the best, will get the best.

What will be the result? Are there moderation marks in CBSE 12 2017? How much grace marks does CBSE give in class 12 exams (PCM)? Does practical marks count in CBSE class 12th results?

        "a": "Let's start from the beginning when there was no religion. At that time there was no reason to feel guilty when no one was seeing you. So some wise men might have thought to introduce the principle of God( a set of rules that are focused to build up the character common people). Also mankind was always stucked in the questions that who we are and from where we had came and by principle of God they also tried to answer that. By this they tried to build a better society but they also tried to get some privilege of the principle of God. This has created social divisions. And along with that some other religions have also evolved. This again leds to conflicts, social divisions and wars. Pros :- Helped people to build a good character. Provides hope to people when they loose all there hope. As we can see at that time there was not much work for elderly people and also an idle mind in devils workshop. So the principle of God provides them some work and also the feeling that they are not idle and they are utilizing there time. Cons:- It created social divisions, wars, stress among the society. Finally, now day cons are dominating over pros. If we remove religion social will be boon with equality, we will find some betterment in relationships between different castes and religions, better relations of nations and many more. Does God exist? Do we need God? Why, or why not? Why did people create religions and the concept of gods? Why would God let the Holocaust happen? If God knows everything, God knows the future. If God knows the future, how can there be free will? The world works with Trinity concept in everything. In any given concept, you can find this Trinity concept as a base. As like the old saying goes, there is always 3 sides for a story, Your view, my view and actual truth. Another example, Positive, Negative and Neutral Put this concept in to existence of god, He/She/it exist, Dont exist, Actual truth. Only if you know the actual truth you can comment with 100% Until that, positive or good is much better for any. So existence of God or religion has to be kept in place for the benefit of others. May be kept in place by wise men like you. This is my view, it's a free country. Hope this help. Thank you for reading... The world would have been a better place! Religion's have been responsible for so much human misery and bloodstream. This trend continues even in this age. The concept of God too is fictionalised differently by each religion. This is something what I believe \u2013 There is a god who has created the universe and earth. It has also created us and all other organisms. Why?? Most of the answers comes from different Religious Structure (Hinduism,Islam,Christianity etc\u2026). Religion are very strong pillars of humanity. These exists from very longtime in regards to universe have kept human beings as groups. Generally these group have developed a common thinking and Leader.They develop culture, Literature, Social structure, a patterned communication system. All together a belief system and made us different from animal beings. This gave humanity the most important weapon for survival power of unity. Bigger the group more powerful were they. But individual had to agree to the beliefs of the group. This way individual and groups were making each other stronger. Still there were day to day problems which were not solved by religion or group. It required some brainwork and help from nature to solve it. Research and development \u2013this is called science. Invention. There can be instances where in Groups overpower a scientific invention to be motivated by their Leader(God). The seeds of the invention were sown by god in the inventors mind. So the credit goes to Leader(God). What I believe Religion/Group has helped Humanity to establish and Science has taken it forward. It is going good. The only challenge is different Religious groups at times get into clash in regards to superiority. Generally fight is about Whose God is real and strong and the irony is never in the history any god has came down to save humanity. The fight has stopped either one side is completely destroyed or mutual agreement. One thing that I am sure of God has no involvement in Religion and Science. I believe god has created this world. Lets look at the creation little closely in Earth. Living and non Living organism, Atmosphere, gravity etc. It is a beautiful and comfortable place. But no one can escape easily. A sort of a golden cage everything is available but you cannot escape except death. Every Living organism that takes birth has to die. Whatever healthy lifestyle they may have. Yes there is an term for individual organism. If you look closely there are 2 important cycles food cycle(Hunger is the most i-resistive feeling) and reproductive cycle(one of the strongest feeling is orgasm). Common to almost all organism. There are very strong and different emotions but most of them created by social structures. The other point that one has to focus is on the gender. There are specifically 2 genders male and female present in almost all the organisms. For a new life to be created both the gender have to meet. Feeling wise orgasm and Parental love will be at the top. Orgasm so that organism can reproduce and parental love because without that infants who are weak cannot be raised or taken care off non selfishly. After birth organisms growth is important so we feel hungry and eat. So what I feel is we are all part of an invisible food cycle we are just like crop reproduced to be eaten. Eaten by our creator. Earth is just like a beautiful farm. So how do we are eaten or what part of our body is eaten in my view Soul is eaten. Just like we wait for a fruit to ripen and then we eat that similarly our creator waits the organism to gets mature and then eats it ripen soul. May be our ancestors were aware of this that is the reason sacrifices and offerings were done to gods. Its always seems God is never interested in what we are doing \u2013 no involvement in good or bad. His presence is observed only when world is about to end \u2013 injustice is prevailing \u2013 People are killing each other \u2013 there is a big chance God\u2019s source of food might get exhausted. They come to earth as avatar . So we are just a kind of crop upon death we are harvested. I also believe apart from God somebody else accompanies us as well. The other being is more helpful than god. So whatever we do in are daily life \u2013 impacts our soul gives it an experience. May be good deeds makes it more tastier and bad deeds makes it less tastier. Ageing of soul also adds the taste. Certainly there is some connection. As we are moving ahead in time we are going far away from truth. May be our ancestors knew this exactly. god is not perfect so its creation is not perfect the only purpose to human life is to become a healthy fruit. We are just carrying a soul and passing time in this world to get ripen. Religion has given hope in a world torn apart by religion.I think the societies would have been more reasonable .People would have been prohuman instead of proGod.",

        "a": "Remember that the whole point of Schr\u00f6dinger's thought experiment was to point out the stupidity of the Copenhagen interpretation. So Schr\u00f6dinger himself would have thought, and I would agree, that interaction with classical objects would have resolved the problem immediately. But if you accept the Copenhagen Interpretation religiously, then it would indeed be in superposition until it interacted with and \u201cobserver\u201d, whatever that may be, Is the Schrodinger's cat dead or alive? Isn't the Schrodinger\u2019s cat thought experiment just hype? It isn't both alive and dead; it's simply an unknown until you open the box. Why is Schr\u00f6dinger's cat alive  and  dead instead of alive  or  dead? What are the results of the Schrodinger cat experiment? Has it been done? Has it been tested? Was the cat alive or dead? Why is my cat simultaneously alive and dead? Yes , but the cat is very, very, very probably dead. Let\u2019s say that the cat\u2019s fate is determined by the decay of a  Polonium-195  atom. This particular isotope of polonium has a  half-life of 4.64 seconds . This means that if we open the box after 4.64 seconds, the cat has a 50% chance of being alive, and a 50% chance of being dead when you collapse the superposition. However, if you open the box after 100 years,  the outcome is determined by how you set up the experiment. I can think of 3 ways to set it up: If the atom decays, the cat dies.  In this case, the cat\u2019s odds get worse and worse over time. After 4.64 seconds (1 half-life), the cat has a 50% chance of still being alive. After 9.28 seconds (2 half-lives), it\u2019s 25%.  After 100 years (680 million half-lives), the cat has a \u2026 1/2^680 000 000 chance of living.  The exact value for this is\u2026 well\u2026 0%. At least according to the Google calculator. If the atom is still there when you open the box, the cat dies.  This is the opposite of case 1, and it means that the cat\u2019s odds get better and better over time. After 4.64 seconds, it\u2019s still 50%. After 9.28 seconds, it\u2019s now 75% (100% - 25%). And  after 100 years, the cat\u2019s odds of living are 1 - 1/2^680000000.  Or, almost 100% (100% - ~0% The cat\u2019s fate is determined only at 4.64 seconds.  If the sensor checks only once after 4.64 seconds,  the cat still has the same 50/50 chance of surviving , and will still be in the same superposition as long as nothing from outside affects it. But, you still need to consider the actual cat itself. How often do you see a cat live for 100 years, inside of a box? You\u2019d need the weirdest, luckiest quantum miracle of quantum tunneling and virtual particles in order for the cat to be alive when you open the box. So, right before you open the box, the cat is in a superposition of being dead a very very long time ago, a slightly less long time ago, and, with less probability than you winning the lottery a million times, alive. It is physically impossible to achieve perfect isolation from the environment. For one, you\u2019d need to bring the temperature down to absolute zero*, which thermodynamics says cannot be achieved by any finite process. Never mind that the bigger the states, the more fragile and consequently short-lived they are. So, no, it probably won\u2019t even last a femtosecond, much less a hundred years :) * - Fun fact: cats don\u2019t like absolute zero temperatures. The real experiment would be a superposition between a dead frozen cat, and a dead frozen cat sprayed with poison. Either way Mr. Whiskers gets it. In quantum theory, the laws that govern an unobserved system are linear. So, if state A would evolve into B after 1 second, and C into D, then the superposition  [math]\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} A + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} C[/math]  will evolve into  [math]\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} B + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} D[/math]  . So let\u2019s assume the radiation source and poison bottle in the box only gets one chance to kill the cat (after one second, the mechanism is automatically disarmed if it did not fire), and there\u2019s no cat food in the box. After one second, the cat is in a superposition of (alive cat) and (dead cat). A few days later, the cat is in a superposition of (very hungry alive cat) and (cat that died of poison a few days ago). A few days after that, the cat is in a superposition of (cat that died of starvation) and (cat that died of poison). After 100 years, the contents of the box are in a superposition of (skeleton of cat that died of starvation, intact poison bottle) and (skeleton of cat that died of poison, broken poison bottle) Open the box, and the wavefunction will collapse to one of these two eigenstates.",

If you are seeking a Project with no expectation of operation or reliability, you can find some deals at car auctions. Just remember there are no guarantees or promises that what you are buying will operate once you leave the gravel yard without the money you paid. If you want a Reliable Vehicle you can operate with little or no maintenance, there are 1000\u2019s of used-car dealers who can offer some assistance, maybe even a service agreement if there becomes a mechanical issue. Most states regulate sales guidelines for a Dealer to obtain a Sales License. I have purchased vehicles at auction, not to drive, but for available parts at a reduced cost over retail supply houses. (Auction vehicles are usually deemed \u201cWholesale\u201d by dealerships where they are taken-in as trades & can not be sold to the public without major work or repairs beyond the value.) Buyer Beware & go to an auction prepared to spend more than is needed. Are car auctions the best place to buy cars from? Is an auction a good place to buy a used car? Is buying cars at an auction risky? What is the best used car to buy for cheap? How much do dealerships buy used cars for from auction? Can I know this when making an offer? I would say no unless you have mechanical knowledge that lets you determine if the car your\u2019re interested in only needs maintenance or minor repairs or if it may have a big and potentially expensive problem. Most people think that they are making the deal of their lives buying at a public auction, and the truth is that most of those auctions are where car dealers dump the trade-ins that they can\u2019t or aren\u2019t willing to sell for some reason (usually an underlying problem that requires too many time or money to repair, frame damage, rust, etc). Other case can be that you find a non-desirable model (an old Geo Metro or a base stick shift Mazda for example) with decent maintenance and no major issues that the dealership decided to dump at the auction because it\u2019s easier to get rid of. I bought a 2008 Kia Rio, base model and stick shift that only needed brake pads and rotors but was mechanically sound. Bottom line, auctions are not for everybody. If you are mechanically inclined and can spot a flower in mud pond MAYBE you find a decent car, and in any case, have at least a grand saved for auction and documentation fees (this is non-negotiable) and any possible repairs or maintenance that the car WILL need. Generally Auto Auctions are for dealers only as you need an auction license if you operate a car lot or dealership . But buying a used car from an ebay auction is entirely different since its available for consumers. I have bought a couple of cars at an auction. I have always bought \u2018cheap\u2019 cars. Recently, the charges that the auction house charge, have made this type of buying unrealistic. Although there is a livestock / car auction house nearby which I could go to. My theory is that cheap cars are more likely to be genuine. Often dealers getting rid of trade ins. I was chatting to a man in the trade. He bought one nice looking car at the auction. It broke down before he got it home. He sold it for scrap. He paid quite a lot of money. His partner\u2019s car had a warped cylinder heat. She returned it to the dealer and got another car at the end of the contract. That car was sent to the auction by the dealer. Until it closed, there used to be an auction house at the back of my house. It meant that it was easy to go. Watching what goes on, is an important part of the process.",

Also be aware that leverage makes your equity riskier and given you\u2019re 18 you may not be in a position to properly judge the risk. Finally also consider that property is a pretty illiquid asset class. If you however believe, property is the asset class for you, you could look for an appropriate collective investment scheme, be it a REIT, some sort of real estate fund or whatever (depending on where you are). These will also apply leverage, but the upside is you won\u2019t be personally liable and your investment will be professionally managed. The downside is however that this is not free and the administration cost of a vehicle like that will eat into your returns. I have just received an inheritance of 80,000. How should I best handle it? I am only 18 and would like to invest in property eventually, but it\u2019s not likely a bank would give a full time student (with no full time work) a loan. I think this is an amazing opportunity I have been given and I want to ensure I deal with it somewhat successfully (to what definition, who knows) It\u2019s an opportunity, but a double-edged sword of an opportunity. I assume we\u2019re talking about $80,000 dollars, yes? Jobst has a sound recommendation. You can open a TD Ameritrade account, fund it with the inheritance, then invest some of it in REIT\u2019s, such as NLY, or MAIN. These can pay you 10% interest annually, and on $40K that\u2019s $4000/yr. Sweet! Also, you can set up an IRA toward future retirement, fund it up to $5000 per year, and grow the nest-egg tax-free. It can also save you on taxes if you have sufficient income. Some of the money can be used to pay down debt as well. And yes, you could gamble it on a larger loan and hope that you can turn a profit, but\u2026that can be a painful learning experience. Better to start small. And remember, Don\u2019t risk what you can\u2019t afford to lose! Cheers. 80000 is a good amount to save for.Since you are only 18, open a ppf account & deposit 80000 there. Yearly put 500Rs into it until you start working. Once you start working save more.When you are about 30 yrs & earn sufficient to get a loan or withdraw half of this ppf amount & invest in a property.",

        "a": "There is a website where anybody can share the names of bad tenants: The National Tenant Reporting Company And of course, landlords can look for any tenant applicants there too - so as to avoid renting to such a tenant. Why do tenants need real estate agents in London? Are real estate agents rich? What does it mean when a real estate agent \"gets\" a listing? Can you send me a list of real estate agent in Pompano Beach? Do we need Real estate agents? I doubt it, I know I don\u2019t but I wish we could (too many liability issues). I thought about starting a website called Tenants From Hell dot Com, and a sister site called Landlords from Hell dot Com. I think it would be very instructive, but we\u2019d probably get sued! LOL. Seriously, the only way to screen tenants is to ask for references, employment verification, and do a thorough background check including credit check, eviction history and criminal history. if ANYTHING looks wrong, reject that tenant until and unless they can provide an explanation that satisfies YOU, the owner. AND get certified/bank checks for the first month\u2019s rent, the security deposit and any other up front fees, for example, here in New Jersey that would be the realtor\u2019s fee which is often paid by the tenant. I had a situation once, my landlord client really wanted to get his place rented fast. He had tried to rent it on his own for a long time and now he wanted it done. The applicant had her friends lie and say they were her boss, her current landlord, etc. She gave us a fake social security number for the background check so it came back fishy. Then she doctored phony bank accounts and income tax returns because she was self employed, to prove income. ALL OF IT WAS FAKE. The kicker was when she said she didn\u2019t have time to get bank checks because there wasn\u2019t enough lead time to transfer money from her investment account to her regular checking account. I advised him not to accept her but he insisted he needed a tenant right away. So I made him put in the lease that he accepted this tenant against my advice. ALL THE CHECKS BOUNCED. She moved in and then conned him into believing she was a battered woman being FORCED to do all this by her abusive boy friend. She agreed to give him her real social security number and when she did the background check showed eviction complaints from two of my other landlord clients. When I called them, they said, \u201cOh, she got you too!\u201d She was a con artist, plain and simple. She lived in his house rent free for about six months. Finally she became abusive to the landlord and he did evict her. Because she bounced over $10K of checks (It was an expensive rental), we were able to charge her with a felony. The prosecutor wanted to let her off with yet another slap on the wrist but the landlord and I both showed up in court to testify as to her falsifying documents, etc., and she went to jail for six months. She was ordered to pay restitution, including making good on the bounced checks. That was six years ago. We are still waiting. Realtors do not have a central database of tenants. Why is it that you ask? Most landlords do pull rental history reports though so when they do their tenant screening they will see any negative issues like evictions or judgements against renters.",

        "a": "Life comes at you fast. Yesterday I was writing Quora answers saying that I thought it was very unlikely Trump would ever be impeached, and then last night skeletons were popping out of White House closets at the rate of about fifteen a minute. One interesting thing to note is that Pence, who was in charge of the transition team, appears to have been told that Mike Flynn was in the pay of Turkey around the time that he was publicly denying that he knew anything about Flynn being a foreign agent. So it\u2019s possible Pence gets taken down in the skelepocalypse as well. Next on the list is Paul Ryan, who overnight was revealed to have been taped telling a colleague to shush about Trump being in the pay of Putin, and then swearing everyone in the room to secrecy, the way one generally does when someone tells a funny joke with no basis in reality. President Orrin Hatch? This time yesterday it was a bonkers thing that people like Louise Mensch were saying, today it starts to feel a bit more like something that could happen. Would Mike Pence be a better US president than Donald Trump? Who would be worse? Who is Donald Trump most likely to choose as Vice President? In what ways would Donald Trump be a better president than Obama? Why do some people call Donald Trump a liar? What would be some pros and cons of Donald Trump becoming president? No. He should not. It remains to be seen if DJT committed any crimes other than foolishness, inattention to detail and refusal to listen to good advice. These are not currently impeachable offenses. They are also not illegal. If he is found to have tried to obstruct justice he is toast however. Who\u2019s the fool now? Trumps foibles were on display during the election so this is what the US voted for. The people asked for and got this package (although they  may  have aspired for more). Buyers remorse is not enough to impeach either. The special prosecutor appointed is one of Americas finest, he has broad powers and I think it would be best to sit back and see where his investigation leads him. There could well be disappointment from the left or the right (or both) when the investigation concludes. Personally I\u2019m guessing that some of Trumps hirelings may go to jail but Trump may be safe - unless, as stated above, he did obstruct the ongoing FBI investigation. But the result can be expected to be thorough and fair. I for one am relieved. It will finally clear the air. My answer is just the opposite of what you seem to imply you want. I hope the Trump presidency is buried in his own foibles and larger misacting for the full four years. We will be saved from the Republican far right actions of giving the rich whatever portion of America they don\u2019t already possess. Were the Republicans smart, they would impeach Trump as soon and as fast as possible. This would put VP Pence as President and he is a member of the far far right. They could pass all of their absurd tax proposals and do everything they wanted relative to bringing America back to the 19th century. Neither. He should have the sense to resign before Trump is impeached.",

        "a": "Only if they press on nerves, or grow very big pressing on their surroundings. Same apply to cancers too, those won\u2019t cause pain unless growing into nerves, or into bones. How much pain does a tumor patient feel? What is the cause of tumors on the forehead? How do I tell whether a tumor on the skin is benign or not? What causes a benign tumor of the membranes around the brain? What can cause a brain tumor to be inoperable? I will go ahead and back the other answers up. Yes, they can cause pain. A benign tumor may not be locally invasive or busy metastasizing themselves, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t grow quickly or can\u2019t happen in the darnedest places. As an example, you can get one in the brain. If it is causing compression, you are going to have some central nervous system effects, even potentially headaches. Even better\u2026spinal cord. Sensitive tissues surrounded by bone don\u2019t do well with compression. My own benign ovarian tumor had gotten big enough (grapefruit-sized) by the time it was discovered that it was falling down into my pelvic canal and starting to block things growing through. Think of the benign tumor as a marble. If you stuck a marble under your skin it might or might not hurt. It is going to depend on if the marble compromises the function of the area it is resting in. You could have a benign tumor that just sits there and doesn't cause a bit of a problem with any surrounding tissue. On the other hand it may be painful because it compresses tissue, or interferes with movement or function. Yes, I think so, sometimes, in the sense that the mass of the tumor could exert tension on the surrounding tissue, and the tension could be perceived as painful. Also depending on where the tumor was located, the contact of the overlying skin with the tumor as well as the possible abrasion to the tissue could hurt. Finally, the weight of the tumor could push or pull on the surrounding tissue and cause soreness. It is a lump, after all. Not all masses are tumors; there are many explanations for abnormal tissue growth. And not all benign tumors are painful; some are not felt at all, even after they are detected. But I am personally thinking more of a subcutaneous type tumor which could cause pain\u2026not because it was growing and intruding, not \u201ceating away\u201d at the body like a malignancy, but because it was displacing other structures or causing pressure or friction and putting things out of their natural position. Note, these opinions are based on my own personal experience; I am not a medical professional and definitely not qualified to give anyone else medical advice. I would just say that if you believe you do have a tumor or growth of some kind, even if you have been told it is benign, or if you notice some kind of growth or mass that hurts or changes, you should have it checked by a doctor, please. It should be monitored. Even benign, non-cancerous tumors sometimes end up having to be removed because they don't belong there and their presence can create other problems, whether they are benign or not. A doctor can put your mind at ease and will know what to watch for and how to treat any mass. I am not a doctor. I believe they can. A benign tumour is one that doesn\u2019t spread to other parts of the body; however, it is a localised swelling and may well cause pain by pressing on other parts of the body.",

Where do we ground our philosophies of good and evil? Essentially, societies are evolving to interpret issues of good and evil however they feel it's acceptable. This is especially true as it pertains to what is deemed acceptable on the sexual level, and also how mental issues play into criminal equations. Flowing out of this, justice becomes a difficult line to walk. What do we base our concepts of justice upon? How do we decide if an individual has done evil, and once we've decided, what is the appropriate response? Should that person experience retributive justice, or is that concept now too arcane? Is consequential justice the only true justice? What do criminals\u200b deserve, and how is this justly decided? On a secularist, naturalist viewpoint, there is no ultimate anchor to justice. We simply have no standard other than our vague sense of \u201cpopular opinion\u201d by which to make important judgments about good and evil, right and wrong. When the culture shifts closer to a relativist morality (you do whatever is good for you), governments lose their moral authority. These are the biggest philosophy and political issues if you ask me. What is the most important objective of philosophic inquiry? How would Plato, Descartes, and Watts each view this? ? What are the most important philosophical problems What are some of the most important and useful philosophical ideas? Who are the most important modern philosophers at present? What do I need to know before reading Spinoza? Do I need to read other philosophers? There is only one problem sin or negative/harmful thought and action in humans there has only ever been one problem, sin was first recognised by the first philosophers 10 000 years ago and humans have been scratching their heads about it ever since, as society slides right there is much scratching at the moment. The science has only just became available to fully explain sin, at the moment it is spread through several sciences and so must be pieced together into a clear picture, very soon some well recognised bright spark will put it all together into one solid scientific theory and practice systems will develop to reduce sin until then us less bright sparks are having a go best guessing science. Always wondered why are they labeled as problems. People explain it all by the means of limits. Why not set the tone differently & jus. call it philosophical questions",

Impeachment is an indictment by the House of Representatives. The Senate then has to decide whether Trump is guilty as charged. Unless & until he is found guilty, the status quo continues. So until Trump is found guilty of the charge(s) in the articles of impeachment, everything continues as before. Will President Trump be impeached? What do Trump supporters think about the fact that he is going back on many of his campaign promises? Do you feel betrayed or disappointed? Will Trump actually be impeached? And if so, can he be put in jail? Would Congress try to impeach Donald Trump if he is elected president? When will Donald Trump be impeached? Just as they followed him into the White House, they\u2019ll follow him out. The reason Trump\u2019s administration has been so nepotistic thus far is because he only wants to surround himself with people that will: Sacrifice their own career and image for him Go down with him when he eventually capitulates Nepotism can only get you so far and I can only imagine Jared Kushner would feel the full force of Pence\u2019s fundamentalism. Either that or this shit show will continue for the foreseeable future, I predict the latter. The relatives would of course leave and judging from what we know this wouldn\u2019t be more than a blip on their routines. Some family members might even welcome the chance to go back to their lives. Non family might well stay because VP Pence almost certainly played some role in choosing staff as did other Trump Administration insiders. A change up might even benefit the Republicans overall and in the long run. If anything, Pence making a second pass through Trump Administration reviews and hires might weed out a few low performers and more Obama appointees. This, by the way, reveals that the Democrats energetic drive to unseat the President won\u2019t help them in any area but \u201cbragging rights\u201d because they know that\u2019s all they have left. In fact, as per above, it will diminish Democrats in government. If this story were to be told objectively, it would be one showing how the Democrats are teetering on the edge of obscurity and impotence. You're Mike Pence and you've just been sworn in. Would YOU keep them? I really rather doubt it. You'd want your own people in place. More to the point why would Trump\u2019s children want to stay on? They're freed of any obligation to continue to serve unless Pence desires it. Pence is under no obligation to keep or fire them; it's entirely his choice. All of his appointments would be expected to resign and the new President to bring in new people. New Presidents sometimes make exceptions and ask specific people to stay but this is rare.",

Narcotics for instance kill by blocking nerve impulses which in turn cause the heart to slow down and the diaphragm to slow so that your circulatory system doesn\u2019t pick up and deliver oxygen to the body as it should. In a way you suffocate although since your brain is also slowing down it feels like going to sleep. Anticoagulants (blood thinners) work by reducing the ability of blood to clot. You\u2019re actually bleeding all the time, especially in the stomach but you normally heal faster than the blood can seep out. But if the blood is thinned too much then you die by internal hemorrhaging. Other drugs like cyanides kill by blocking nerve impulses but in a different way than narcotics. Some drugs stop digestive processes so you slowly starve to death. Some drugs like nicotines kill you very slowly by causing cancer. A boy died recently in S Carolina presumably from caffeine, another drug, which when overdosed causes heart failure by making it beat too fast (fibrillation). There are literally thousands of different drugs and each has a different affect on the body, far too many to list here. There are books with thousands of pages listing the effects of drugs and how they can kill you. Just because a drug is legal or illegal is no indication of whether or not it can kill you. Caffeine and Aspirin can both kill you but are legal. Marijuana cannot kill you but is illegal.

You cannot stop your parents. Their beliefs are their own, and since they are both aligned in their belief, they will support one another. What you can do is establish your own beliefs and stand as firmly behind them as your parents do with theirs. You should do so with respect and not in an argumentative manner. You may not agree with their beliefs, but you certainly love your parents. Take care not to get the two mixed. You tell them what you think but in a way they won\u2019t get defensive; explain that they did a great job raising you so well that you are now perfectly capable of taking care of yourself including what is right and not so right for you! DOn\u2019t do the pleasing bullshit. It will just make you more upset because you sacrifice and there is never, never a need for sacrifice! Wow! This sounds much more annoying than my mother telling me that every success I have is due to her praying to St. Mary! She\u2019s Catholic in her later years and is trying to get into Heaven by praying. In your case, they are really taking over your life. I would stand my ground, thank them for their concern and not try to change their beliefs. Just tell them respectfully that you need to succeed on your own, that they are keeping you as a baby or child by constantly hovering and trying to direct you in what you do. Is the astrologer charging money? If so, you could tell him to back off or you\u2019ll report him to your state\u2019s Attorney General!",

Indeed, it is far easier to become a fully-funded international graduate student at those same universities than to become an international freshman.

In an educated dialogue between intelligent people, the approach, the correct one, is: \u201cI just told you what I believe is true, now I am ready to listen and consider your point of view\u201d. No arguing, no harsh discussion, but simply a gentlemen\u2019s dialogue. The fight starts when you want to CONVINCE the other that he is wrong and that you are right. Nobody has to be forced to accept a point of view by force: if the point of view is valid, it will find his good way in the other person\u2019s mind. Why do some people argue that they are God? Should people argue about religion? What is the most annoying thing about smart people? What is it about religion that people don't get? Why is it so hard to argue with people about money? People argue about their religion for the same reason that people argue about anything that they feel strongly about - attachment. When people get attached to a belief system [religious or not], and believe it to be correct under all circumstances, it causes conflict and often makes people forget what\u00a0 the belief is fundamentally about [for most religions, it is living moral and loving lives]. When people get attached to a label and identify themselves strongly with something, any disagreement or opposition feels like a threat to ones dignity and identity. This is the case on non-religious topics too. You can see in history when people become too attached to ideologies it leads to terrible circumstances. Marxism and Communism is the best example. What on paper seemed like a good idea has led to the death of millions of people. Nationalism is the attachment to a flag or a country - also led to war and xenophobia etc, of which people forget that we are all human and not separate or different after all. These ideas can lead to an \u201cus and them\u201d mentality. \u201cI\u2019m right, you\u2019re wrong\u201d. \u201cMy worldview is better or the only worldview\u201d [meta-narratives].

Leaving out the math and assuming you are asking about the wavy outer profile and not something constructed like cardboard: Corrugated plastic can be manufactured thick enough to be strong enough for many applications, but it will not stand under heavy loads, such as regular traffic. We use it as detention chambers for storm water and generally bury it 2 or more feet deep, filling around with specific combinations of gravel and sand to help maintain its shape. It is not strong enough for traffic to go over it, so it\u2019s generally put in places there will be no regular traffic driving around, like back yards or roadside swales or other \u201copen\u201d spaces. See  Stormtech  for more info. Corrugated steel pipe is generally used for culverts under roads and driveways where each end is open, for instance, to let a ditch flow under a driveway. They can be quite large and are sometimes installed in pairs or groups if a road or driveway needs to be built over a large ditch or creek. They need a certain amount of dirt over the top to protect them because they can collapse if too much weight is put on them. Concrete pipes are used the same as corrugated steel if there isn\u2019t enough cover over the pipe or the ditch is shallow. Concrete is also used under roads for \u201cregular\u201d storm water removal as part of a system that may be made up of all concrete or a combination of concrete and other materials (ductile iron, steel and various types of PVC) and may have fittings (wyes, tees, bends, etc.) and/or connect to various structures such as catch basins and manholes.

Was Saul of Tarsus a priest of Mithras? What are protestant types? I think that Paul was anointed by God to preach the gospel. Paul sacrificed much to do this: power, position, and even some fame. He was jailed, beaten, mocked, and left for dead for his devotion. He was humble, so much that he kept his \u201cday job\u201d to earn a living instead of taking money from people He encouraged others to grow in the faith, and encouraged believers to love and support one another. All of this, yet he would be the first person to tell us not to use him as a role model. Our role model should always be Jesus, and Paul made sure people knew that. The Apostle Paul was one of the more significant converts in history. The person who was chasing early believers, having them jailed and killed becomes the greatest missionary ever to the Gentiles. His letters to the early churches are God's word to us today on how to conduct ourselves. He was a chosen vessel for God to work through, and he did his job admirably.

Read\u2014\u2192>>>>>  RCB Team 2017 Players List But Unfortunately, RCB Team did not win any IPL Season. But they were Three Time Runners-up in IPL Seasons. They have reached nearby to obtain the IPL Cup on a few IPL Seasons but failed and will be looking to set the record straight this time. My favorite team  RCB Team 2017  which are super powerful now with Gayle, AB De Villiers, Virat Kohli, Mitchell Starc and Shane Watson added to the batting firepower. But RCB Team 2017 is very bearing from bowling. They have the critical bowling line up excluding Fast bowler Mitchell Starc. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Do you Want RCB to Win IPL 2017?\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Which team can you predict will win in IPL 2017? Can RPS win IPL 2017? Will RCB win IPL 2017? How can RCB win the IPL 2017? Who will win the 2015 Indian Premier League? Looking at the points table at this point of time, the favorites seem to be KKR and SRH. Also MI seem to get into mood as we progress towards the business end of the tournament. We are almost at the halfway point in the tournament and all the teams have played a minimum of 5 matches. So right now, rather than who will win, who won\u2019t win would be very apt. Let me list the teams as per their chances to win in descending order : KKR - They have a strong batting unit. No doubt. As far as bowling unit, we cannot trust the likes of Umesh yadav. However they boast of Narine, Kuldeep and Coulter-Nile. Their chances are bright for being a prospective winner. SRH - Again. They have proved to be a strong unit beyond David Warner. Seeing the kind of innings from Williamson last night, I believe they have enough firepower to face a strong bowling attack. If yuvraj starts firing, then only god can save the opposition. SRH boasts the strongest of bowling units. MI - Only now Hitman is getting back to form. Otherwise this team is saved only by their young brigade in the form of Rana and Pandya brothers. Also the likes of Malinga, Pollard and Bumrah seemed a bit inconsistent with their trades, easily negotiated barring a couple of games. MI is known for their surprises in the latter stages of tournament. Fingers crossed. RCB - Now this would be the team that most of us would have routed to win the tournament before the start of the tournament. Certainly not now. Two consecutive losses to lesser known teams in their own fortress Bengaluru should have severely dented their confidence. Injury worries for ABD, form woes of Gayle until last game were all major concerns for RCB. Also they don\u2019t boast a dominating bowling attack as well. Except Chahal everybody else has been on and off. But, this team is still dangerous. I personally back them, even though they are lagging behind. These guys are dangerous unless injury hits them. KXIP & DD - Both the teams are similar. Started well with consecutive wins. Faltered midway, struggling now. Their prospects are low considering the above mentioned teams, but still they may spring a surprise to get into the playoffs. Only god knows..! GL & RPS - Actually, more than the crown, the wooden spoon position seems to be in high demand. Both RPS and GL have been playing a league of their own. Even RPS we shall forgive citing the kind of talent they have. Very young domestic players except a few. But GL, not even in their wildest dreams would have thought to be in the last spot. Everybody in form, but still losing. Might be some kind of bad luck. If they are making it to the semis, its either a miracle or match-fixing..! (Just kidding) My personal favorites are still RCB and KKR. The two times IPL and CL Champions,  MUMBAI INDIANS  is the most stable team in IPL this year. Even Harsha Bhogle is backing this team to lift their 3rd IPL title this year. Talking about Batting line up : ROHIT SHARMA : The captain leading from the front. Holding the record of maximum runs in an ODI inning. He is among the top scorers in IPL, a perfect match winner. PARTIV PATEL : This man is back in his form, seen him in deodar and vijay hazare, scoring tons of runs. He would be quite handy this year. LENDL SIMMONS : The West Indies Batsman is an excellent opener for MI. He has proved his power hitting a lot of times. AMBATI RAYUDU : No. 3rd position belongs to this man. Although he has not sealed a place in the Indian squad but in the mumabi he is a match winner. JOSH BUTTLER : England has produced a lot of power hitters and one of them is Buttler. Last year he has showed his skills and this year he would definitely be waiting to hold his willow back in IPL 10. KIER0N POLLARD : The power hitter of Mumbai Indians. The star of West Indies. The man who has the power to hit majestic boundaries even from the tip of the bat. He is a handy player down the batting order. KRUNAL PNADYA : He has scored lots of runs batting up the order in domestic this year. Mumbai would definitely utilize his power hitting. HARDIK PANDYA : Another Pandya who has showed his power hitting a number of times both for Mumbai and India. He is a perfect player to bat at no. 6 or 7. ASELA GUNARATNE : Jayawardene\u2019s influence has brought the Sri Lankan power hitter in Mumbai\u2019s squad. He is a batman who has the ability to finsh the games for his team. SAURABH TIWARY : From the Virat Kohli\u2019s Under 19 world cup winning squad, this man has not gained the fame and name he deserved but no one could neglect his batting skills and his power hitting. HARBHAJAN SINGH : The man who has earned his name in power hitting. He has the ability to increase the run rate in the death overs. Now the Bowling department : Mumbai has always been known for the furious bowling line up. Check it out : LASIT MALING : The T20 World Cup winning captain for Sri Lanka is always the first choice for anyone when ever there is a talk on the shortest format of the game. No doubt he is the best bowler of IPL. His yorkers, his slowers, bouncers and his variations make it very difficult to hit runs. MITCHELL JOHNSON : The Australian Star Bowler is back in the squad. The furious bowler would be very handy this year. His aggression would be the perfect way for Mumbai to start their bowling attack. JASPRIT BUMBRAH : The world No. 2 T20 bowler is in the Mumbai squad. He is the best bowler of India in the death overs and he has proved his worthiness a lot of times. He would help the team saving those crucial runs in the last overs. MITCHELL McCLENAGHAN : The New Zealand seamer is a real match winning player who has the ability to strike early and keep the opposition under pressure with his variations. TIM SOUTHEE : Another New Zealand fast bowler who has showed his skills a lot of times and would definitely like to rain wickets this year. HARBHAJAN SINGH : The Indian spinner who has a majestic name in this game. He is no doubt one of the best spinners India has ever produced. KRUNAL PANDYA : Left arm spinner is the requirement of every team and here comes the name of the elder Pandya Brother. He could strike crucial wickets and could bowl in those middle 6 - 8 overs. HARDIK PANDYA : India vs Bangladesh World T 20, who could forget that match. Hardik Pandya is a match winner. KIERON POLLARD : A perfect all rounder for Mumbai. This West Indies hunk has produced a lot of match winning performances. KARAN SHARMA : He is a good spinner, he has the ability to take crucial wickets. If given a chance he would be handy. ASELA GUNARATNE : An all rounder who is very good with the bowl. He has produced very good innings for Sri Lanka. Fielding department : Lendl Simmons, Kieron Pollard, Rohit Shrama, Hardik Pandya, Josh Buttler, Mitch Johnson, Krunal Pandya and a lot of other names as well. Under the leader ship of the legend, Jonty Rhods this team has done pretty well in fielding department as well. I guess the playing 11 should like like this : LENDL SIMMONS/JOS BUTTLER PARTHIV PATEL (Wk) AMBATI RAYUDU/ NITISH RANA ROHIT SHARMA (c) KRUNAL PANDYA KIERON POLLARD HARDIK PANDYA HARBHAJAN SINGH MITCHELL JHONSON/ MITCHELL McCLANGHAN LASIT MALINGA JASPRIT BUMBRAH Support Staff : Sachin Tendulkar  : Icon Mahela Jayawardene  : Head Coach Robin Singh  : Assistant and Batting Coach Shane Bond  : Bowling Coach Jonty Rhodes  : Fielding Coach Rahul Sanghvi  : Team Manager Afzal Khan  : Assistant Strength & Conditioning Coach Dr Nitin Patel  : Physio Paul Chapman  : Trainer Amit Shah  : Sports Massage Therapist Shyam Sundar Jayapalan  : Assistant Physiotherapist A nice combination of Batsmen, All Rounders, Bowlers this team seems very handy this year. They have the ability to lift the trophy and I am backing them. For me MUMABI INDIANS has the strongest line up in IPL 2017. They have a fair chance of winning the title for their 3rd time this year. Indian Premier League  \u2013 IPL is the Twenty20 cricket tournament where franchise team participates for the title. There are eight teams in IPL10 that are going to play against each other to be final winner of IPL Tenth (Vivo IPL 2017). Here are names of Eight teams:- 1)  Delhi Daredevils (DD) \u00a0 2)  Mumbai Indians (MI) \u00a0 3)  Rising Pune Supergiants (RPS) \u00a0 4)  Gujarat Lions (GL) \u00a0 5)  Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) \u00a0 6)  Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) \u00a0 7)  Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) \u00a0 8)  Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) Anything goes in T20 contests once 4 teams reach the playoff stage. What team do you think were the real champions of this season? Why? Which team has very good chances to win IPL 10th Season? I think RCB WILL WINNER THIS TIME IN IPL 10 please verdict Ipl twenty 20 top and lowest team by no. like no 1,3,5 and very lower team is. till then  Watch Vivo Ipl 10 Live Streaming 2017 I believe there will be a high probability for MI, KKR and SRH to win the trophy. These three franchises have a balanced side in both bowling and batting and they've the character required to win the trophy. MI  has a balance squad at the moment, they're not making any huge changes with their top order overseas players. They even have Mitchell Johnson in their bowling attack who had a fantastic BBL earlier in this year. At the very moment they're on the top of the table winning 3 out of 4 matches. Even the first match was close but they lost to the class of Steve Smith who's in an breathtaking form. KKR  it's a beautiful franchise , it is one other team which has a very balanced side for a long time. Unfortunately their opening batsmen Chris Lynn is injured, not to mention he had a fantastic BBL and is the man of the tournament. They've good overseas replacements too. The Indian players in the squad itself is very strong. SRH  are the defending champions , they've a good balance in the squad. They've found this balance once yuvraj solidified the middle order. They've Kane Williamson who's one of the best batsmen in the world. They've one of the best bowling line up with which they won last years trophy. They've Chris Jordan or Rashid Khan to backup for Fizz if he fails. Once you've the balance in your side , there will be confidence and momentum which is very important in this format of the game. I believe two of those three will be in finals, however it depends on other circumstances too. My heart goes with SRH.",

Regarding  cardio , I would suggest running, cycling or simply playing some outdoor sports with your friends (like basketball, football etc.). As for  weight training , start of with bodyweight exercises like push ups, pull ups, planks, bodyweight squats, dips, bodyweight lunges etc. You can also incorporate some actual weight training in the gym. It will not affect your bone mass or stop you from growing taller, no worries. Just focus on doing  perfect form , lower weights and higher rep stuff. You are still very young so don\u2019t overcomplicate things. Just have fun! In regards to your  nutrition regime , it all depends. If you are really overweight I would suggest you go on a slight caloric deficit and start losing weight slowly. If you're not overweight then don\u2019t focus too much on nutrition as you are very young. Just try to incorporate as much healthy whole foods as possible and eat enough! If you're interested in the best foods to gain weight I would suggest reading my article on  the best 79 foods do gain weight. And you also  don't need any supplements  for weight gain.

        "a": "I do not see too many Senior IT Services guys writing in Quora so i thought of putting my two cents here from my 14 years working at both onsite and offshore roles. The most important reason that loss will happen in long term are - a) Shorter duration of Projects  - Projects are work with a fixed time , cost and scope. In IT services all work are called as projects as a terminology. Example - Support project. I am not referring to the generic definition of projects. I am referring project from a customer point of view (New system build, new capability build etc). Previously, the industry followed a SDLC model as projects where long and massive. Here Operating margins used to come and hence offshoring made the money. In simple terms beyond design stage look for work which can be done remotely. So we ended up building a large poll of developers and testers at offshore. In came the onsite offshore ratio etc. Now projects are like 1 month with 5 persons. Where will you offshore this work ? Previous Project example mid scale: Implement SAP in 7 locations. requirements, Blue print, specifications, design, build, ST, IT, UAT, Cut-over, go live. You see beyond blueprint stage the offshore spikes and again goes down at the end stage. Yes a bell curve offshore ramp up and down. Current digital project example mid scale: Implement a AI based chat automation which can take care of user incidents on same portal. Product analysis (done by client) , Use case build for product analysis ( done by client), Deployment and testing, Go live. Did you see i mentioned deployment and not development? Did you see i mentioned deployment and testing together? This is \u2018devOps\u2019 concept in new world. Small team at onsite who codes, implements and tests. Projects follow Agile/Time boxed models which needs less head counts. b) Reducing control of Client CIO  - The money a company\u2019s CIO gets to spend on IT has gone down. In new world the CIO\u2019s focus is more of business as usual (keep the IT system running). This translates to support projects for offshore companies. The remaining CIO budget has gone in data projects, social media projects and so on. So a money cut has come from CIO to CDO, CMO. This affects IT services as now new D services mostly related to data does not come as IT project, it comes as business projects. IT services leadership now is chasing the CDO/CMO\u2019s as well but competition comes from other Non It functional companies. Company A - A big logistics company and wants to implement a solution to track its assets over the cloud using IoT. Hence, looking for a solution and a vendor to do this work and handover the knowledge. This for a client is lead by Business team and not the client\u2019s IT team. The client finds out that cloud can be provided by many companies but IoT know how is very business based and hence looks for companies in same industry who have done it. Finds out that a logistics company has done it earlier and now offer asset solutions to other logistics companies. Company A awards contract to Company B and uses a IT services company only for the cloud part. So you see the money has got split now. See Amazon, 10 years back it was e-commerce now can you just call Amazon an e-commerce company? they have API economy, they have cloud and they also have media. c) Changed demand -  No more legacy replacement. Focus is now Digital work. Prior to 2013 customer asked - \u2018 can you deliver this scope within this time and an acceptable amount of risk with a low cost\u2019 - The focus was scope and cost . Indian IT services are champs when it comes to cost management. This worked well then. Now client asks - I want to increase my revenue, i am in banking and insurance but i wish to enter Energy trading. I am in Media and i wish to enter in Travel industry. Can you help me ? - Indian IT were late to respond and react to such client demand primarily as it became lazy. The best answer they had was to send a team from their consulting arm. The client was not asking that - it was asking about a business road map to change its business and revenue model by application of software's like AI platforms, Digital platforms. A digital team is not like the old days software team. A digital team has a marketer, a graphic designer, a social media strategy, DevOps etc d) Automation -  Any work that is periodic and follows a if/the/else logic can be replaced by automated software. Example - Find a project for a resource in bench, allocate tickets. Even if the work does not follow a operative regime deep learning can be used which can learn from experience. e) Skill set demand has changed  - Focus is more on the geek now. A person who has strong Computer science background rather than IT. Coders who can look beyond API\u2019s and develop existing computer science algo\u2019s and build up solutions. Example - Use Graph theory for learning algo\u2019s. f) Non cross pollinated skills  - In 90\u2019s when there was demand of j2ee people got trained, when there was a SAP demand people got trained, when there was BI demand people moved from databases to BI. Where is the problem now? Figure this, to move into AI. The basic problem you need to solve in Python/r are logistic regression, nearest neighbors. By the time you are in day 2 of such training your BE degree has been used up. By the time you are in day 0 (pre-requisites) your mathematics in BE is used up (Linear algebra/ Vectors/ Matrix/ calculus). The Indian IT had long sacrificed the core computer engineering long back to focus on API based code to spec, now it need better quality of computer science skills and programming skills. Aspiring minds report on coding skill reports a sub 3% engineers ready for such work. Do an experiment - Sign up for a deep learning online class or a machine learning - you will get what i mean. The below link is a renowned free course and even provides a certificate - try it if you have not tried. After you have tried this comment back - can these skills be taught in a flat mode like we did for J2EE? Machine learning is just an example. Machine Learning | Coursera the bottom line is some may be cross pollinated with these skills but not majorly. Who are at risk  - Ask yourself , can you work be expressed a a regular process? If yes then you are at risk. Example - BPO, IT L1 Support, System admins, Infra manager. Ask yourself if you are in testing , Are you doing black box manual testing? If yes you are in risk in long term. Remember , new work dev + tester = DevOps (vaguely) Are you a project manager and managing offshore time sheets, some short term contracts and managing efforts/quality in internal tools. Then you are in risk as FTE count will fall and your job becomes irrelevant. This is very true if you just know what the project does as a IT work and not having complete business view. Are you an offshore delivery manager - You already know the problem and the solution but you are in late 30\u2019s or mid 40 now. Can you take up an onsite Programme Manager role? If No - you are at risk in long term. Your experience counts very less at offshore now as there are no longer stacks of projects to manage. You will no longer have 300 - 500 persons to manage, you will need to manager an outcome/an organisation change/draft IT-Business strategy and road-maps. This is tough as a good number of Indians at onsite have moved in such work long back and thanks to Visa crisis you are at risk. Are you a BA, involving work which does process due diligence, RFP support, competency etc - You maybe at risk unless you move onsite. Are you sub 3 year experience - Keep expectations grounded, focus on training and do not rely on company to train you. If you are not coding then eventually you may be at risk but not now as you do not cost a fortune. Are in in final year - Ahem! Good luck, the campus will drop. Look at plan B - MBA/ Mtech just in case placements do not happen. Non CSE branches will have a tough time and if you get a core offer - take it. Move into some CSE related electives if you may. Work harder on core concepts. No longer will the campus guy ask you your hobby, check your aptitude and ask a simple linked list and offer you. The smart kid is not more the blue eyed campus pick - the geek is. Have you done some hacks? Have you made a basic robot? What is your fav. algo which you think can be used in health care. Have you worked on some open source data sets? So you see - the table has turned. have a look at some basic algo\u2019s that are needed in new world. these are very basic. Robotics blog from India | Robotics blog | Robotics club Are you a great coder ? - Welcome to the league. You will face enormous growth. yes , the industry will keep growing but the party will be invite only ( geek, great coders, leaders not managers, domain real know how and value added sales pro). Do you have business acumen? - Welcome to the new world of entrepreneurs. You may drive a local business and stay floated. May be not the next start up but with strong business fundamentals a local business can be achieved. Thanks for reading.

        "a": "Energy - like time - is one of those concepts that is difficult to define without using a circular definition (work <=> energy) or without careful development of a lot of supporting ideas of Newtonian physics. But here is an attempt at a simple working definition. Energy is what you need to make anything  change . Without energy, everything in the universe would be \u201cstuck\u201d or frozen in place. If something is moving, we say it has \u201ckinetic energy\u201d. If a moving object bumps into something else it can transfer some of its energy, so that second thing can also begin to move. Think of a ping-pong paddle hitting a ball. The ball\u2019s motion could be in a straight line (translational) and/or rotational. The energy transferred during the impact will also make the molecules of the ball jiggle around randomly. We call this disordered vibrational motion \u201cheat energy\u201d. All objects warmer than absolute zero are vibrating like this. As temperatures increase, there is even more vibrational motion. We recognize another type of energy, which we call \u201cpotential energy\u201d that isn\u2019t necessarily associated with motion, but which depends on the position or arrangement of particles. Examples include a flower pot on a sixth floor windowsill, a drawn bow & arrow, or a molecule of gasoline. The flower pot could be pushed off by the cat, to smash on the sidewalk. The arrow could be released to speed toward a target, and (given a small spark) the atoms within gasoline and oxygen will rearrange explosively to make carbon dioxide and water. We see that by rearranging particles, potential energy has been released to produce motion. So does energy exist? It\u2019s important to realize that energy is not a \u201cthing\u201d, but a concept (an idea). Does energy exist? I think it does, so yes! It exists simply because we are thinking about it! :-) You might compare the \u201cconcept of energy\u201d to the \u201cconcept of beauty\u201d. I think they both exist, but an exact mathematical definition of energy has been worked out by physicists. That\u2019s so we can all agree on how much energy is associated with a particular thing, while beauty is subjective and we can certainly disagree about whether a thing is beautiful or not. Here\u2019s the terrific thing about the concept of energy:  for every change in the universe that mankind has observed, the total amount of energy before and after that change is unaltered . That is, energy is transferred between places and objects but is never \u201clost\u201d, created or destroyed. Physicists call this constancy \u201cconservation of energy\u201d, and along with \u201cconservation of matter\u201d and \u201cconservation of electric charge\u201d, it is a very powerful tool for figuring out how everything in the universe works. Who \u201cinvented\u201d the concept of energy? It\u2019s hard to be certain, but Isaac Newton did most of the work of defining how energy is computed. Since Newton\u2019s time, James Joule, Benjamin Thompson (aka Count Rumford) and many others have added to our understanding of energy. Does God exist? Can you prove that I exist? Can theoretical physics prove the existence of God? Can physics prove that our mind exists? What is energy and how do we prove it exist? James Prescott Joule was the first to introduce energy in physics in the 1840\u2019s. I think that the existence of energy has been sufficiently proven by now. But I guess you are asking what the essence or building block is of energy? I think that is still an unresolved question. Anyway, this is what the famous scientist Richard Feynman has to say about your kind of question: e=mc^2 You know there was no electrical energy till Thor discovered lightning\u2026 or errr not.. hehe.. I am thinking the weight and force ideas as well as current are moreso energies of themselves. Energy is work done by EM frequency manipulations and other things.",

        "a": "Again, it is not my place to make online diagnoses, but what you have described is a bout of mania that is typical for those who are diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Now, all conditions of Bipolar are not the same. The most common type are usually mostly on the depressive side and rarely peak on the manic side. What is important is that one does not get words confused because they sound or are spelled similar. Mania and manic have absolutely nothing to do with the word maniac, although at one time it was thus described in some dictionaries. In Bipolar, mania or being manic simply means the opposite of being depressed, as in a radical mood swing. In depression, one feels tired, sleeps heavily, and has no energy to speak of, they they swing to the other end of the spectrum or the opposite end of the pole and become euphoric, full of energy, highly creative, with a rapid thought process and of course require much less sleep. Now bear in mind, some people who are Bipolar are latent, which means it does not manifest itself until adulthood, even as late as being in their 40s or 50s. Some experience very light depression that they don\u2019t even recognize any of the symptoms. But, then I am only making a stab in the dark from what you described. What you first need to do is go see a medical practitioner and required a full medical examination with a complete blood work to test for all physical illnesses or anomalies. Why? Because more often than not, when odd things happen, it is your body\u2019s way of saying, \u201cHelp!\u201d Now, after that, if there is nothing there, ask for a recommendation to see a Psychiatrist. Don\u2019t get excited, all a Psychiatrist is, is a medical doctor that specialized in mental health conditions, disorders, and syndromes. They are the only one capable of medically treating your health that is non physical. Yet, remember, they are not therapists, (although some of them think they are), what is ironic is that psychiatric nurses are better trained in therapy than Psychiatrists are. Which truly makes the book/movie, \u201cOne Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d horrific is the power control Psychopathic Psychosis of Nurse Ratched. If you missed the role reversal of the insane leading the treatable cleverly created by author Ken Kesey and brilliantly scripted to screen by Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman, then you need to watch the film again. I watch it often as it is one of the greatest films ever made. It was the second film to sweep the five top Oscars which are best movie, best lead actor (Jack Nicholson), best lead actress (Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched), Best director (Milos Forman) and Best Screenwriter. What is sad though, is the movie industry is become so evolved based on worst case sensationalism that the first top five sweep of the Oscars was a Romance Comedy in 1934, called, \u201cIt Happened One Night\u201d starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. The second was, about the negative of mental health which although had its comic relief and placed in the genre of comedy-drama, it was in truth a tragic horror book/film, \u201cOne Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d Cuckoo is a derogatory term. Then the third and so far the only film to date to have won the top five sweep of Oscars was, \u201cThe Silence of The Lambs\u201d another film about the dark side of mental health causing more paranoia about psychopaths being directly linked to criminals and serial killer, even juicing this one up by the antagonist being a cannibal. Now, the entertainment value of the film is remarkable, but it is pure fiction and fantasy. Folks need to realize that and respect it for what it is. There is no link to reality with that film. It might as well be science fiction. Still amazing that in spite of how they fluff up what films are the highest grossing films of all time are. One can not dismiss that \u201cThe Silence of The Lambs\u201d had only a budget of of 19 million dollars and just its \u201cBox Office\u201d take alone is just over 272 million dollars, that is not include rentals, dvd sales or later digital releases. Sure you can say that, \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d is the greatest grossing movie ever, but that includes adjustments for inflation, and multiple sales of distribution to television stations, video sales, laser disc sales, DVD sales, Digitized sales, Blu-Ray sales, etc, etc, etc. Oh, did I forget Beta? LOL Cheer I feel so happy that I couldn't sleep for more than 3 hours and still don't feel sleepy. Am I normal? I can't sleep more than 7 hours each night, is this normal? Which working hours are more efficient? 7-3 or 9-5? Why would you choose to have more than one child? Is being a single is good? Usually the way one thinks is a response to the environment. Not just the current environment, but the situations you have been involved in since you were born. When you\u2019re pre-lingual or not very educated, there are a lot of things that happen to you that you have no way of changing or preventing. So instead of learning how to fix a problem, you learn how to soothe the feelings the problem engenders. If your environment includes a lot of pressure to perform at a very high level, then your brain can respond by amping up its effort from time to time. When a brain is active in this way, people can be very active, enthusiastic, constantly thinking and unable to sleep much. Sometimes people put out so much energy that it is unsustainable, and their mind seems to lose its energy, and people can suffer through a period of being unable to do much. They may come to feel depressed, as well. Other people seem to be able to maintain a high level of activity for years. Why brains respond differently to different experiences is not well understood. Actually, it\u2019s not understood at all. Sometimes people will say that responses such as the one you describe are \u201csickness.\u201d This is because it is not a common experience. This is about all I can say, because the rest is unique to you. What you describe can happen. No one can sort out why it is happening except you. You may need help sorting out why it is happening from people with experience looking for stories that can help people make meaning out of what happens in their brains. You can also observe your own mind and your own experiences and look for patterns. A lot of people think of these patterns as triggers that trigger a habitual response. The brain sorts things into categories of information, often pruning out a lot of detail, but maintaining some kind of core set of commonalities in experiences. This causes it to trigger responses that may not be appropriate, if the brain has generalized too much. The only way to modify habits of thought is to identify triggers and responses, and then practice alternative ways of responding. So, to conclude, there\u2019s no answering this question without interviewing you extensively about your life. No one is going to do that unless you pay them or they are a very good friend. But these friends may or may not be helpful, depending on how skilled they are at interviewing and helping you make connections. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to do the work of figuring out the answer on your own. Fear not. Asking the question is the best place to start. Work on it. You\u2019ll figure it out. it can happen when there is not enough stimulation in your daily life or maybe there is a lot of stimulation all of a sudden which gives you that energy if you are intelligent and curious, you need to be fulfilled. if you are physical you need enough physical activity energy needs to used- otherwise our psyche arranges it for us by saying hey come on you need to do something about this its only the second time - so it is very possible this is the case or are you excited about something if it was happening as a regular event over time then we could look at lack of sleep to start with and other things too I used to get that way because I was living \u2018in my head\u2019. I ignored my body, intuition and emotions because so did everyone else - only my intellect was educated and referred to. I used to feel like there was a sheet of perspex between me and the world. Gradually, over the years, I realised I was more able to experience the world with immediacy i.e feel it. If you want to change this pattern, think back to what you loved doing as a child. Look into different ways of being - meditation, mindfulness, therapy, yoga, martial arts, art, dance, music etc. Find what you love and what inspires you.",

The reconnaissance version of MiG-25 with the Egyptian Air Force saw a lot of action during during 1971\u201372. It was apparently operated by Soviet crews. It successfully evaded Israeli efforts at shooting it down. The Indian Air Force operated a squadron of reconnaissance MiG-25RBs successfully for over two decades, finally retiring them in 2006. One of these created a commotion in 1997 when it broke the sound barrier over Pakistan. Pakistan interpreted this as a deliberate taunt. The MiG-25 fighters with the Iraqi Air Force saw a lot of action during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980\u201388. The Iraqi Air Force appears to have established air dominance against the Iranian Air Force, with more than 20 kills of Iranian F-4s and F-5s by the MiG-25s. One Colonel Mohammed Rayyan of the Iraqi Air Force was credited with 10 kills! The MiG-25 distinguished itself fairly well during the First Gulf War. A MiG-25 shot down a US Navy F-18 on the very first day of the war. In another famous incident, a single MiG-25 successfully disrupted a bombing run by eight F-15s by firing at and scaring away the accompanying ECM aircraft, and then successfully outrunning the F-15s! Hope this brief reply helps! Please also review  Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 - Wikipedia  and also references given in the article for more information. Why are the MiG-21 and Mig-27 so unstable? Can the MiG-31 to escape from the AIM-120? How do the SR-71 and MiG 25 compare? Has a MiG ever managed to shoot down an F-16? Does the US military ever use AKs when fighting in a war or in any other form of combat? They were used in the Iraq war by Iraqis. But they were outperformed by the American F-15s and some got shot down. One Mig 25 also shot an F-18 down. Mig 25s were rather better as a reconnaissance aircraft rather than Interceptors.",

        "a": "As i have recently completed my second year in chemical engineering, BITS Pilani, i can review chemical branch of BITS. Course Structure-  The order of subjects are properly designed which help in completing all chemical courses in 5 semesters ( instead of 6). But the main problem is no. Of tests. In BITS, chemical is known for tests only and nothing else. We have test in almost every class. In 2\u20132, we had a course Material science in which we had 30 tests in a semester. Many times, only chemical students are seen in washroom at 8 am because they have to go for test as usual. After a limit, you literally get pissed off and don't give a f**k to tests. Faculty-  If you want to find the most sadist people in BITS, welcome to chemical department. They have an inner hatred for students and find no. Of ways to play with their lives. Except few teachers, mostly teachers dont have deep knowledge of the subject. They only know to conduct tests. I want to tell you some incidents from which you can conclude their level. Incident 1:  Prof Ak pani once announced in class that today is last test before midsem so everyone thought to skip the next class, and the very next day he took a surprised test. Incident 2:In  the last days of semester, he said that he will take last test in last lecture and there is no test today. So some students preferred to leave the boring lectures, and guess what one more test was waiting at the end of class . Placements:  Fortunately, placement are pretty good in chemical. This year average package is around 9 lkh with \\U0001f4af% placement. But very few students go in the core sector and other chose finance/consultancy/IT jobs over it. It is because of less interest in core plus and down market of chemical in India which attracts less core recruiters. Other positive points include: AC classrooms Classes till 1 pm only So overall i think NIT trichy may be better than BITS in chemical. Someone correct me wherever i am wrong. BITS Pilani: How are hostels of Pilani campus? Any recent photos of hostel? What is the craziest story you have heard from BITS Pilani (any campus)? Should someone go for a placement at Reliance Oil or an M.E. in chemical at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus? Is BITS Pilani better than NIT Warangal? How does BITS-Pilani, Goa Campus compare with NIT-K? Both BITS PILANI and NT TRICHY are excellent Colleges so you are very lucky if you have an option to choose between the two. Congratulations. No person can give a correct comparision because each of us would have Studied at only one of them (NITT or BITS) so we will not know about the other. I am aware that Chemical engineering is very good in NIT TRICHY. I would also like to say that NITT has one of the biggest Engineering College Campuses in India and it has an absolutely amazing Campus life. However, I have heard lots of good things about BITS PILANI too. NIT TRICHY Chemical is very good. Please check about BITS from a BITSian. I would like to inform you that BITS is very expensive and if you cannot afford it then NIT TRICHY is a better option. NITTian for life :-)",

        "a": "Attacked much sooner, say in late May or early June before the Soviets had a chance to prepare their defenses and summon masslive reserves to that front. He would have had to do it without fancy new Tiger, Panther and Ferdinand tanks/tank destroyers, but would have had some chance of success. or Not attacked at all, straightened German lines, dug in and used the newly reequipped Panzer divisions as mobile reserves. What was the battle of Kursk? What could Hitler have done to avoid losing World War II? What if the Germans won the battle of Kursk? Did the Italian army win an important battle in Europe in WWII? Was it possible for the Nazis to win the Battle of Kursk? Hitler should have adapted their intelligence, put more trust in his generals, stopped or slowed the British information given to the Soviets and checked the weather. Because of the British breaking the German cipher codes, the Soviets knew well in advance of Germany\u2019s attempt to pinch off the Russian bulge in the Kursk salient in Operation: Citadel and destroy the Army that won Stalingrad for the Soviets. While Hitler was waiting on the new Panther and Tiger tanks to roll off the assembly line, the Red Army had time to build defensive belts, included minefields, fortifications, artillery fire zones and anti-tank strong points, which extended approximately almost 200 mi. deep. Soviet mobile formations were moved out of the salient and a large reserve force was formed for strategic counter-offensives. Everything was in place for the Germans to launch on July 5, 1943. But the Russians set off a barrage hours before the attack would begin. They already knew the German timetable and surprised them in advance of the attack. It took two hours for the Germans to regroup and start the attack behind schedule. Because of the fortifications built by the Russians, the South German push was halted after about 20 miles and the northern push barely made six miles into Soviet territory. It quickly became a war of attrition with the Germans making headway, but unable to take advantage. By July 10, 1943, the Americans and British had hit the beaches at Sicily, finally opening a second front and, two days later, Hitler ordered troops to redeploy to help the Italians. From that point, \u2018Citadel\u2019 was over and the Red Army held the offensive through the end of the war. Winning the Battle of Kursk, the largest tank battle in history, was beyond the capacity of Hitler. The Wehrmacht\u2019s victories were achieved by surprise and blitzkrieg, not the anticipated slug-fest against entrenched and prepared positions. The Red Army had many weeks to prepare while Hitler waited for delivery of his new and improved tanks. Soviet firepower and manpower were enough to stop the German Army before it made much progress. The attempted battle of encirclement was a thing of the past for the Germans. The Russians had learned all the hard lessons and were well-equipped and well-led. The Battle of Kursk was just the type of attritional warfare the Wehrmacht would lose given Soviet production and war material from the United Kingdom and USA. I disagree with the other answers to this question. By this point in the war the Red Army, despite all its own problems, had the measure of the Germans and their tactics. They established themselves in the Kursk salient with the express understanding that they wanted the Germans to attempt the encirclement and waste their resources trying the same old tactic of creating the \u201cKessel\u201d and cutting off the Russian troops from escape, then mopping them up and/or taking them prisoner. The Soviets were aware of this and used their troops in the salient as bait (they had little regard for casualties as long as they won the battle int the long run - see Stalingrad and Rzhev). The Kursk salient was established with layers of defensive lines so that when one inevitably fell to the German onslaught the survivors would retreat to the next and continue the fight. The point was to wear the Germans down and fight a battle of attrition of their tanks and planes and infantry. Meanwhile, to the east, reserves of Soviet tanks and infantry stood ready to enter the fray if necessary. As for starting sooner, in May, this would probably not have made a significant difference. The British had warned Stalin in advance of the German intentions (they had learned this through Ultra, but Stalin did not know about the Enigma code being broken). The Soviets also had pretty good intelligence from agents on the ground. The biggest problem with an offensive in May which  MIGHT  have interrupted the Soviet defensive planning, was that the Germans were extremely paranoid about the defeat at Stalingrad and Hitler was determined to provide his best and latest and most fearsome equipment for the assault, Panthers and Tiger VIs, to deal with the Soviet T-34 tanks, and those were being shipped in as they came off the lines. This created major delays in the start date. Even had it not delayed the start the new super-tanks did not change the outcome of the battle (for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which were being fuel hogs and being extremely liable to mechanical failures in the field). So it is highly likely that even if they had started in May without the new equipment the outcome would have been the same. The Red Army had more than double the artillery of the Wehrmacht and an equal number of air resources, unlike most other similar battles to that time. The salient had defensive lines up to 100 miles deep with anti-tank guns and minefields. German delays allowed improvements to these defenses, but probably without the new tanks and tank destroyers they waited for the destruction would have been the same and the massive numerical superiority of T-34s would have had an easier time of stopping the German armor. Stalingrad was the key to Kursk. Hitler and his generals were so afraid of another similar defeat at the hands of the Red Army that they spent too much time and effort preparing for the battle even after it was obvious the Red Army knew they were coming, what their plans were, and what tactics they would use. Because of German paranoia I suspect the Battle of Kursk was a foregone conclusion. Zhukov had the measure of the Wehrmacht at this point and the Red Army had proven that it was more than willing to throw its forces ruthlessly into the battle so long as a victory was the outcome. This was a tactic the Germans never really came to grips with. As has been discussed elsewhere on Quora, Stalin had the German plans for attacking Kursk - probably obtained twice, once from their spies in the British code-breaking service, and again when the British shared the news. Thus, the Russians could design a defense in depth which had the desired effect of chewing up the German attack. This is another time the Germans should have suspected that their was a leak of their plans.",

When he found out he didn't agree with Voldemort, he fought back in an extremely smart way. He didn't force Kreacher to drink the potion, but drank it himself so that his house elf wouldn't have to endure the effects again (or, even at all, if Kreacher hadn't been forced to drink it by Vollie yet had still known the effects). Regulus Arcturus Black was an amazing human being who righted his wrongs even though still being extremely young, and being brought up in a household that glorified Voldemort\u2019s ideas. It was expected of him that he joined Voldemort, but he turned it around himself. Oh, God, I love Regulus. Can the Death Eaters kill Harry Potter? How can people forgive Snape for being a death eater, but can't forgive James for being a bully? What are the qualifications for becoming a Death Eater? Who is the most faithful death eater?

If you buy a bottle of juice in the farmers market it may not have a brand but it probably will have a phone number on it. By that it\u2019s saying \u2014 here\u2019s a guarantee. If you do not like something or it does not taste right or you get sick \u2014 this is my number, you can call me, i am responsible for what I sell. Branding in the first place is about expressing an idea, a benefit and creating understanding what\u2019s that product is actually about.  Brand should communicate what value that particular product provides. Brands are about accumulating experience.  It means you can try that brand and then get back to the very same product thus making repeat purchase which is not possible if there is no possibility to identify the product.  Identity lets you identify. Brands are about consistency and coherence.  That means you can rely that the brand will give you a promise and then deliver on it. It will be consistent always and everywhere. People love to phantasise.  And brands often create fantastic universes. We are emotional beings.  And brands provide emotional experiences. People look for identity and meaning  and want to belong to particular tribe, identify with certain values, lifestyles, tribes, groups. Brands help us understand who we are  and demonstrate that to the world as well. Brands are like beacons in the ocean of uncertainty.  Brands give you safe choices: You can identify who made that product. You know that manufacturer guarantees quality and takes responsibility, you know whom to blame\u2026 You better understand the particular uniqueness and benefits. You can accumulate experience. You can make better informed decisions. Naturally, in the case of no-name product nothing of this is possible\u2026 Why do some people find it more ethical to kill and eat plants rather than animals?

The more likely scenario, though still very unlikely, is that the GOP or Democrats morphs into something more reflective of what they are involved in governing today. This sort of thing is very hard for politicians to do, The money and power are all very interested in the status quo. It is these people, who fund the political parties in the US for interests that are purely self serving, who by and large, choose our policies and people to administer those policies. If they want things to stay the same, things will stay the same. If they are forced to make changes they will do so, but it will be changes that support and enhance their positions of power and money. They crave stability above all else, unless they need a change in the laws for their own self interest or see emerging industries and sectors that they can exploit with new changes. The changes are never to \u201chelp\u201d the common folks. Interests groups who give money are the ones who get attention. Talk of change is mostly just for show. Real change comes over generations with new blood and new ideas, and most importantly, with the attrition from the old age of the supporters and office holders, or scandal of those in power. Of course those new ideas come with the same old political class self interest first and foremost. It happens, but it is hard to see in the moment. You need to look at from an historical perspective, then it is easier to see. I doubt the GOP or the Dems will lose their grip on the power they hold. That\u2019s all I have to say about that.

Even if he's seeing such dreams than the most correct opinion is that he's possessed by shayateen i.e. devils, but that is not the case.

Tell them how much you appreciate them using your service and how your business is built on recommendations. Also ask them to write a review of your service on your Google Business page and any other free listing sites that you can sign up for.

Once in the system, it initialises by connecting to a website on an unregistered domain and encrypts all the vulnerable data on client side. If the client machine is on a local area network, all the machines on that network are also affected.

        "a": "Determining how much equity each member of a founding team should get is often a tricky situation for many. This analysis is further complicated when each individuals contributions to the company are not equal in terms of time or money. Paul Graham and Fred Wilson have both provided some interesting thoughts on this front. Here is what they have said: 1)  Paul Graham 's advice: http://paulgraham.com/equity.html Let's run through an example. Suppose the company wants to make a \"profit\" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above. So subtract a third from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his \"retail\" price. Suppose further that he's going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead, x 1.5 = $90k total. If the company's valuation is $2 million, $90k is 4.5%. 11.1% - 4.5% = an offer of 6.6%. 2)  Fred Wilson  advice (a bit simpler): http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/05/... Here's a formula I like to use. Take the cumulative salaries of all the hires you need to make between the current financing and the next one. Let's say it is five employees at an average of $75,000. Then that number is $375,000. Then divide that number by the post-money valuation, in this case $5mm. That gives you 7.5%. That's the size of the option pool you'll need. And it is conservative because I don't recommend giving options equal to the dollar value of the annual salary of your hires. I like anywhere between 0.1x to 1x (depending on role and responsibility), with the average being in the .25x range. But early on in a company, you will need to and want to be more generous. Also, when issuing equity to the founding team, the following are the key things you should button up from a legal perspective: Vesting : You always want to make sure the equity grants to the founding team are subject to vesting. Assuming you are set up as a c-corp, you will likely grant equity to the founding tea, in the form of restricted stock as opposed to options. Issuing such stock subject to vesting protects the company in a couple of ways: (a) it makes sure that key team members stay on board with the company for a certain period of time in order to earn the full amount of their equity grant and (b) if someone does leave the company before his equity vests, unvested equity would revert back to the company (and be available to be used for others who join the team to replace the person who left). One additional thing to note is that when granting equity subject to vesting, the recipient should consult his accountant and make an 83(b) election if appropriate to avoid unintended tax consequences. Although there are various ways to structure vesting, the most common approach is to have equity vest over a four-year period with a one-year cliff and monthly vesting thereafter. More on this here:  Nait Patel's answer to What does \"4 years vesting with 1 year cliff\" mean? IP Assignment : It is crucial that as part of receiving equity, all founding team members assign IP they may have created that is crucial to the business. Failing to do so at the onset could result in disputes down the road as to what IP belongs to the company and what belongs to the particular individual. Roles, Rights and Responsibilities : When you have more than one founder or key people in a company, in addition to the equity splits and IP assignments, it is crucial to discuss and agree on each person\u2019s rights, duties and responsibilities, capital or asset contributions, removal process and requirements at the onset. Once you reach an agreement on these items, the agreed terms should then documented. In addition, it is equally important to have proper documents in place that govern the business and owners financial and managerial rights and duties. For an LLC, this document is typically referred to as an LLC Operating Agreement (single-member, multi-member or manager-managed). For a c-corporation, this document is typically referred to as the Bylaws. This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.... How much equity should I get as CTO/co-founder? How should equity be split in a startup? How much equity should a founder keep? What does \"4 years vesting with 1 year cliff\" mean? Our startup made $200k in revenue last year. We're looking for $500k investment. How much equity should we give away to our investor? There are no typical equity splits. But there is a guiding principle that you should follow: Fairness. Each of you should feel good about the equity you received. That\u2019s how you will know you have arrived at the right amount of equity. It sounds easy in practice, but getting to a fair split of equity is actually very hard because, many times, people don\u2019t tell the truth about their feelings. Look and listen carefully. You need to really listen to what your cofounders are saying when you have the equity discussion. And you need to observe their body language too. Just because someone says they are okay with the deal doesn\u2019t mean they are okay with the deal. So you\u2019re going to have to dig deep. If something doesn\u2019t feel right, then it probably isn\u2019t right. Be generous. You, the CEO, should be generous with the equity. Don\u2019t keep it all for yourself because you will piss off your cofounders. Instead give a little from your split to your cofounders. Your generosity will be rewarded many times over during the years to come. There will likely be a do or die situation for your company (actually, there may be many do or die situations) where one of your cofounders or employees will have to step up. That\u2019s where your loyalty and integrity you showed by being generous with your equity helps you. For more, read:  How Much Equity Do Your Employees Deserve? - Brett J. Fox 33.3%-33.3%-33.3% is typical. 35%-35%-30% causes problems. 40%-40%-20% happens if there is a difference of one co-founder. 51%-22.5%-22.5% is what my deal was on my second company.* *4% pool in reserve for friends and family and employees.",

        "a": "Google has created, and refined a fantasic solution to a difficult problem. It answers the question \u201c How popular is this web-page \u201d.  It does this by counting references to that page and quantifying the popularity with appropriate weightings. Google\u2019s engines can do this with remarkable speed and efficiency. However there is a problem. And it\u2019s a very big problem. It crops up all over the place. You might have encountered it when googling for a good solution to a programming problem, or when looking for unbiased news. The algorithm cannot solve \u201c How  accurate  is this web page \u201d. When programming, we frequently find top ranking answers, which are completely out of date, because the technology changed last year. When looking for stories with political content we can end up finding propoganda or outright lies because people link to stories which confirm their biases more than stories which stick to verifiable facts. This is a very significant problem. Google\u2019s current algorithm is driven by heat more than it driven by light. And Google\u2019s reliance on advertising as a business model, does not encourage them to fix the harder problem, because heat is better marketing than light. If you went 10 years into the future and you could only make 5 Google searches before coming back, what would they be? What does Google's \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" feature do? How many search queries does Google serve worldwide every day? Is Google search case sensitive? What is the likelihood that Google will be overtaken by another search engine in the next 10 years? I think you\u2019ll find that Google search has changed very dramatically in the last 10+ years. 10 years ago results were, as  Glyn Williams  points out, the result of \u201cpopularity\u201d. Today, results are far more customized by what Google knows about  you . (Which is quite a lot). To confirm this, try Googling a few terms from a friend or relative\u2019s account. Someone who has quite different interests from you. And you\u2019ll be amazed how different the results are from yours. If Google feels the same now as it did 10 years ago then that means it has improved significantly which is fairly impressive. Why: Increased amount of data. There is way more data to index. This normally reduces the quality of search results. SPAM. There is a constant attempt by people to get their website with bad information at the top of the search result. Just keeping results relevant is work. Increased expectations. Slowly you expect more. Try going back and watching an old TV show or using a 10 year old computer. At the time it was amazing now \u2026 it is still good but not the same. So for the normal Google search to still feel good after 10 years is fairly impressive. That being said other parts have improved significantly: Google Images is way better than it used to be due to AI and image recognition. YouTube automatic CC and therefore searching of videos is now actually useable. Google Scholar and Google Book has improved significantly. I'm not really sure what Google can do to improve their basic search functionality since it is already \u201cgood\u201d. I agree with you that from the user perspective it is mostly like that. However, from the backend perspective it isn\u2019t really like that. All people all the time try to beat Google and bring low quality sites to the top of the search. Actually managing to beat them and keep the quality requires a huge work and is still a great success. Not to say that the web is growing and keeping everything scaled up requires quite a lot of work. Though I agree that Google is so big company that it is expected to go beyond that.",

        "a": "Well, firstly it mainly lies in your interest. Though at this stage it's hard to say what a person wants as you may hardly know what a BDS student does in his ug years. Like any other person I wanted to be a Dr., a MBBS Dr. more specifically. I didn't think or actually consider dentistry until the results were out. I was like I wouldn't want to put my hand in someone else's mouth for the rest of my life. This was me prior to PMT (premedical test; previously there wasn't NEET). Results were out and I couldn't get MBBS. That was saddening. I realised that the next option was BDS, or for that reason even Ayurveda and Homeopathy were available. I had a choice of biotech engineering (I guess that was what it's called) in VIT. But i wasn't keen on engineering, gave the exam just because my brother had asked me to. There was another option and that was to take a drop. But I knew myself that I wouldn't be able to study. The break wouldn't be fruitful. So I chose BDS. So initially I had chosen to give PMT again though my senior had said that doing both BDS and PMT studies isn't possible. Then there was an orientation lecture given by Dr. Manish Aggrawal, a prosthodontist where he said that most of us didn't choose BDS but his lecture made me choose to continue BDS. Yeah, he was inspiring, a person who my senior had already said to look forward to. The first year of BDS, and I was like, \u2018Why are we working with wax, plaster, etc? We aren't masons or sculptors to do these things!\u2019 Yeah, that was me initially. But these things are the central part of dentistry: Dental Material; dentistry will forever be grateful to dental materials. Every year, we learn something and the practical work that we do in first year is the very useful and important in our lives if we want to continue to practice dentistry. Today, I'm an intern and I absolutely love my work, whether it's treating patients or doing lab work. It's all art and science in dentistry. So coming back to your question, it depends on you; if you really want MBBS then take a year drop and study for it. Otherwise you can choose BDS. BDS isn't bad or inferior to MBBS if you're wondering about that. You study the same subjects as a MBBS student does, in addition to your dental subjects. BDS is an already specialised branch and you can open your own clinic after graduation or may study for pg. I don't mean to undermine any profession but it's obvious that you can't practice as a general physician in case of just MBBS (you can actually but you wouldn't want to). People look for a specialist most of the times. In case of a BDS grad, you can call in a specialist. At the end of the day, it's your call. Think clearly what you exactly want to do few years later and choose wisely. All the best! Ps- Sketch your future but with a pencil.",

        "a": "This is indeed a hot topic. The reason it is a hot topic, is because its about the very nature of who we are biologically and who we would like to be. It's basically condemning one side of the coin while approving of the other, and thus relying entirely on biology or society. Both are not always compatible. I believe that it\u2019s actually happening. A good way of showing this, is to browse East European social media and West European social media and then compare the pictures that female users have uploaded. Some believe that femininity can only be seen in real life, but that is not the case. Pictures tell a thousand words. There is this picture that was in a debate room a few weeks ago and I managed to recover it. A guy cut and pasted two pictures. To the left is an Eastern European, and to the right is a Western European. I believe this also applies to men, not only women. Western men are softer than Eastern men. Use public images to do your own research and come to conclusions. Here is a video on East European men and how they are supposed to look like: Eastern European Men School (Video) Men: I am a man. Many men seem to like feminine women more than me. Why? How do I get in touch with my feminine side? Women: What do uncovered Western women think of when they see us Muslim women who wear a niqab and are covered from head to toe? Has feminism made women feel pressured to do male-oriented jobs and sports? And is it no longer acceptable for a woman to embrace her feminini... I'm a straight guy who seems to think more feminine, and attracted to either bisexual or type A women. How do I attract the women I want? What does that exactly mean, \u201close their femininity?\u201d You mean change with the times, demand an education, drive, play sports, ride a bicycle, wear comfortable clothing, decide for themselves about whom they will have sex with, determine their own future, have opinions, vote, handle their own money? You mean those things? That isn't losing femininity; that is being the woman they were meant to be. No one has \u201clost femininity;\u201d western women have redefined it. Western women want what virtually everyone on the planet wants: a voice in the conversation and a seat at the human table. I like to tell people to get off Quora and make their own observations and then get back to me. I'm assuming that since you\u2019re asking this, you've already done at least minimum research. Even if you just take your own experiences, what have you observed? I can honestly say, yes they have lost their femininity. No, they didn't lose it, they shredded it and set the ribbons ablaze. How would I know? You mean how I, a man, know they've abandoned it? Yeah, cause how would I know if they lost the very thing that attracts men to them in the first place? Honestly the governments of the west (God I hate to say it, but mostly  white  coutries) allow females ro run around and misbehave. They're basically spoilt children who have never learned to fear a beating. The result, all this confusion that you see which not only results in questions of them losing their identities, but also the bringing down of a nation. They're allowed to set standards like what a real man is and how he should treat a female but when have you heard of a man telling what a real woman is, or how they should treat a man? It\u2019s basically however they feel and since emotions are constantly changing, so do their so called standards. Yep, the West is doomed.",

It\u2019s a biological level tool that uses the Earth\u2019s gravity as it\u2019s frame of reference. Remove gravity, and the concept of \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d become meaningless. The fluid in your ears will begin to float, inducing temporary nausea, dizziness, and other related symptoms. When your brain adjusts to the new baseline nerve signals, those symptoms subside. To answer your main question- on whether circulation is affected by body orientation in space (xyz) when in outer space (outside of Earth), the short answer is  no. Your heart will continue to beat, pumping blood through arteries and veins as strongly as it did before. The brain is linked to this network, though the absence of gravity will result in adaptive physiological changes that lower heart rate, reduce blood pressure and increase fluid loss. If blood stopped reaching the brain, astronauts would pass out and die on accident very easily. Can a person die if hung upside down for too long? How do bats deal with the blood rushing to their head when they hang upside down? Is it possible to eat even when we are upside down? Why would someone hold a knife upside down in a fight? Why are we not upside down on earth? Upside down reference to what? The earth? Your ship\u2019s floor? Well, in zero gravity there is no defined up or down, east, or west. There's no way to define direction. That\u2019s why zero gravity can be so disorienting. Let's just say that your thinking of your ship\u2019s floor as down, and you are floating above it with your head being the closest part of your body to the floor. Blood will not rush to your head because there is no gravity to move it there, there is no force acting on your blood other than your heart circulating it around your body. Your blood would circulate as if you were \u201cStanding up\u201d in reference to your ship\u2019s floor. In other words, being \u201cupside down\u201d would have absolutely no different effect than if you were \u201cstanding up\u201d in reference to your ship\u2019s floor. Hope this helps! There is NO such thing as Up/Down in space (you will experience it especially when you are far away from any reference point like Earth). You will NOT even know which way you are going without the use of special scientific instruments and also you will NOT experience it even if you are traveling in space at high speeds. It is like you don\u2019t feel the earth rotating on its axis and revolving around the Sun at high speeds though you are on Earth.",

        "a": "The dynamic Indian IT industry has always lured the brightest minds with challenging career options. Students are also attracted to this field because, apart from getting international exposure, the earnings are usually higher. They also get the satisfaction of being a part of something that could possibly shape the future. One such career option is software testing. Initially, software testing and software development went hand in hand, but now it has emerged as a specialized discipline in itself. The role of a software tester is crucial as they are trained to pick out flaws, if any, in the software. They test the software using various parameters to determine its ease of use, and flow of operation. They check the software for bugs and also determine whether it meets the business and technical requirements. This then helps the developers to iron out even the minutest of errors and save themselves from the embarrassment of a software failure due to a minor flaw. What does the job of a software tester entail? A- The job of a software tester entails understanding what the user expects from a software product and evaluating the software being developed to see if it fulfillls those expectations. These expectations relate not only to the features the software should have, but also other attributes, such as ease of use, performance, and security. In addition, the software tester has to ensure that even if users make mistakes while using the software and enter incorrect data, the software is able to handle those situations. Want to learn Hands on practical Online Software Testing Training by Industry Professional. In Software Testing, we provide two modules : Manual Testing and Selenium ( Automation Testing ).Selenium is the Trending Automation Tool in the world . by learning Software testing You can easily get the Job Anywhere.

Which one is good to join? Can I get a good job in HRM field through amcat or other aptitude tests? Is there any apti test to get into hr field? I am B.E fresher. Are there any job openings for freshers? I'm in my BBA final year. What can I do to get a good job in software testing being a fresher? I am fresher. I'm learning Hadoop. Will I have good job opportunities on it? The real truth of software industry is that entry for freshers is always hard unless you manage to beg a job College campus -Easy Off campus - Hard Walk-ins - Very hard As such it is difficult to get bulk opening for freshers in testing. Usually openings are from 1+ yr exp. Try to contact your college seniors if they can give some referral Try companies like Infosys which have references based calling for written exam. Prepare well for it. You can always prepare for a testing even before getting job but most of the institute does not give proper training and does not provide real time experience. Try to find some very good coaching institutes near by with corporate trainers.Don't just throw away your money until you are satisfied with coaching standard. I suggest first learn manual testing asap with minimum time investment.Just to understand basics. Then learn different open source automation tools with practical sessions like Selenium, Appium, Protractor and one programming language like Java Join different groups related to testing on what's app,linkedin,Facebook etc and see what is going in real projects. You can also try with development field. Try to join internship programme in some company. Prepare resume properly well don't write to many things but what ever you write should be known at good level. Try to solve puzzles to increase brain thinking capacity. A simple example can be asked like Swap 2 variable with out using third variable.Just logic is required. All the best. Sooner or later everybody will get job then thing matters are good and smart decisions and getting reference without loosing them with bad preparation. One last thing if some say give us this much money during training don't join that company.They are fake.If someone say we have source we can get you job then that is only 1% true in very rare cases so just rely on your learning.",

        "a": "It doesn\u2019t matter how much sleep you get, if you\u2019re not a morning person then having energy in the morning can seem like a myth. As soon as the alarm strikes, it\u2019s all too tempting to pull the covers over your head, and once you eventually make it up to face the day, you are walking around in a zombie-like phase at least until lunch. But, mornings don\u2019t have to be something that you dread, with these simple steps you can finally be that energetic morning person. :D First things first, ditch the snooze. Does anyone honestly wake up feeling more refreshed after that 7-minute snooze? It\u2019s just a tease, taking you back to that magical sleep you were in only to be pulled back out of it a few minutes later. When you wake up, get out of bed. We all do it when we wake up, spend at least ten minutes under the covers checking up on all the social media we have missed over night, but the longer you lounge in bed the more you want to stay there. Head for the caffeine/tea/hot lemon water. (my choice of morning though) Energy doesn\u2019t always come naturally, but caffeine can help to give you the boost you need. Having some shortly after awakening can help to eliminate that morning grogginess, setting you up to face the day. Don\u2019t skip breakfast. Are you one of those who claim to not be hungry in the morning? Well, you are. While you were sleeping your body entered into starvation mode, and while this can lead to you not having much of an appetite for food, your body needs it. Break the rules, have carbs after dark. On the topic of food, it\u2019s time to break the \u2018no carbs after six\u2019 philosophy and carb up at night. Having a bowl of porridge before bed can not only give you a better night\u2019s sleep, which will help you to wake up feeling refreshed, but provides a slow energy release that will last through to the morning. Beat the tiredness with exercise. (Follow 10 minute home workout sessions) When you wake up feeling exhausted the last thing on your mind is probably going to be exercise. While an extra half an hour in bed may seem like the best solution, exercise may actually help you to feel more awake. Have something to get up for. Often having no plans can lead to lazing. If you don\u2019t have anything to do, then you don\u2019t need energy and you are likely to give into the snooze. And more important, think positive. O:) Why is it so hard to wake up in the morning? If I were to wake up at 6am every morning for a month straight, would my body adjust to waking up early, or would I still feel tired when I wa... Why do we feel tired after we sleep for a really long time, instead of waking up fresh? How do I wake up suddenly in the morning? Why do I always have dreams during sleep every night? I am so tired when l wake up in the morning. Are there some ways to stop it, and is it b... A way that I wake up feeling refreshed is to try and get enough sleep the night before. (8-9 hours). I also go for a run every morning, so that I'll be awake, and energized for when school starts. If you're always tired in the morning, it means that you're either not getting enough sleep, or you're not getting enough quality sleep. If you wake up in the middle of the night, that's going to disrupt your sleeping schedule. If at all possible, try to avoid waking up in the middle of the night. You have to know how much you need to sleep, if you don't want to be tired. You can do this by going to bed whenever you feel tired, and then see what time you wake up. See how long you slept for, and that'll be around how much sleep you're going to need to get each night. Try to do this on a day when you don't have school/work, so that you won't have a certain time to get up. Then, once you find out how much you need to sleep, go to bed at a good time, so that you are able to get the amount of sleep that you need. Start your day with a glass of ice water. It jump-starts your metabolism and wakes you up, the grogginess you feel upon waking up is mostly the result of being dehydrated all night long. This is a no-brainer, but you could also try taking your showers in the morning. If that\u2019s too extreme for you, just wash your face with cold water. Shooting for a solid 8 hours of sleep should definitely help too. You\u2019re most likely tired because you\u2019re not getting enough sleep. Apart from the usual, No heavy meals right before bed No heavy workouts right before bed No bright lights right before bed No caffeine after 3pm 2 things that worked for me: During bedtime, I started to keep my room slightly cooler than what was usually comfortable to me. I would still keep myself warm with a light blanket though. Secondly I keep a window slightly open for some fresh air to come in. Or else I would be depriving my body of fresh oxygen. Ok, first stop is to check out your quality of sleep, are you having trouble sleeping? Do you wake often for some reason, are you snoring? Answer yes, you could have sleep apnea as I do, a trip to the doctor is a good choice. Before I had this diagnosis, I woke up extremely tired each morning and also fell asleep at the drop of the hat throughout the day. Get it checked out.",

        "a": "Theoretically speaking - an increase in interest rates in an economy will discourage consumers and firms from borrowing money (as it is more expensive to do so) whilst also encouraging consumers and firm to save more money in the bank (as they get a greater return). This should mean that overall economic activity will decrease causing less money to spent on goods/services and less investment in projects from firms. This will mean less people demanding goods, less people are earning, less goods are being created and therefore less economic growth in an economy (so less GDP). The opposite is also true - lower interest rates means less costly to borrow from banks and less return for saving so more investment and spending, causing a higher amount of economic activity and growth! All this is theoretical of course and this does not always ring true, which is currently being seen in the UK and the EU (the lowering of interest rates not having the desired positive effect on growth.

Feelings are trained responses that have become default, there's no overcoming them, they will happen irrespective of your wishes and you will feel them. The only way is to take the counter intuitive path by acting irrespective of your feelings. It's never easy, especially when you start. But over time, if you persist, you'll get there. Start small, practice self enablement, make the actions easier to perform. Read on motivation and decision making theories, practice self awareness to allow you notice the moments you accept your feelings as reality. You'll be fine, conditions aren't as solid as they may seem, consistent effort will always wear down the hardest barriers. Patience, persistence and presence are the rules in this game. Stay chilled, be god of your world. I write more  here How do we overcome the regret of feeling we\u2019ve wasted too many years? How can I overcome this feeling? How can I overcome a guilty feeling? How can I overcome feeling ugly? How do I overcome this pathetic feeling? When a disciple pleaded helpless, Swami Vivekananda thundered. What nonsense are you talking? Within you lies indomitable power.Only thinking, \u2018I am nothing, i am nothing,\u2019 you have become powerless.You do not deserve to live if you cannot help yourselves. If you are miserable, try to conquer it, try to be happy. It is therefore a tremendous error to feel helpless. Do not seek help from anyone. We are our own help. If we cannot help ourselves, there is none to help us.But you are a spirit. Pull yourself out of difficulties by yourself! \u201cSave yourself by yourself! There is none to help you,never was. To think that there is, is a sweet delusion. It comes to no good\u201d Watch this inspiring ted talk by Nick Vujicic. \u201c It's a lie to think you're not good enough. It's a lie to think you're not worth anything.\u201d I Hope you find the peace you seek. Thank you. Happy reading! Hello, I know this feeling well also. Sit with your eyes closed and relax a bit. Then imagine this feeling of helplessness. Imagine it has a form. Look closely at it. Then imagine that it can hear you and speak to you. What is it saying to you? Listen closely. Ask it what it wants from you. Listen honestly. Once you have done this a few times and are able to see helplessness for what it is, ask yourself, \u201cIf this is not really part of me, then what is it\u201d? \u201cIf this is not me, then who and what am I\u201d? Once you can separate this feeling/thought form from yourself, you can get rid of it. I have posted some meditations and exercises for doing this at my blog listed above. You can do this. Take care Jon Does helplessness mean that your just wallowing in self pity ,doing nothing? wither you know it or not a large piece of life is struggle . the best ,brightest and most talented people struggle to be and stay on top of their game. Many if not most brilliant and talented people are nothing special because they refuse to work at what their good at. There is a story of two frogs in the same situation,both fell in pitchers of milk and where trapped destine to drown in the milk. One frog resigned to his situation just didn't move and felt sorry for himself until he drowned. the other frog not resigned to drowning furiously swam hitting the sides of the pitcher then the other sides always moving always trying. The frog unknowingly through his furious constant movement on the milk churned it into butter. Now on solid butter he could jump out of the pitcher.

        "a": "Belief in Jesus was never based on his writing or editing skils. When we, who are believers, say that scriptures are \u201cGod\u2019s Word\u201d it\u2019s shorthand. In fact, we really say that Jesus is \u201cGod\u2019s Word\u201d and that the collected writings of Jewish and Christian believers are part of the testimony of witnesses who have experienced God\u2019s presence in history. Different Christians say it differently: some say that the written scriptures (Bible) contain God\u2019s word, or witness to God\u2019s word. Luther pointed out that the Bible is \u201cthe manger in which the Christ Child was laid \u2026 but therein was also much straw.\u201d In other words, very few of us believe that these are the dictated words of God to mindless scribes. Most theories of the inspiration of the Bible point out the important role of scribes, prophets, historians, and gospel writers who interpreted the events of their day and shared their insights with their contemporaries. Those of us who revere those scriptures find that their insights are coherent with our own faith, and give us new insights into our own experience, much like intelligent people discussing life, ideas, hopes, and dreams. Some believe that this written conversation is highly authoritative, and through God\u2019s involvement is free from error. Others believe that all human conversation of God is so limited that we ought to be very careful about claiming that what we have is the \u201cactual words\u201d of Jesus. Intellectual and scholarly believers (there are many) point out that nobody who wrote letters to churches or collected the stories that were being told knew that 2000 years later there would be people who would hold them to a standard of mindless rote memory that was not part of their intent. They wrote to convince others, much the same way as I might tell you an inspirational story of resistance to injustice in a movie, without claiming that everything was literal. \u201cGhostwriters\u201d is a pejorative term for hired hacks who pretend to write a first-person account for somebody too lazy or incompetent to write their own autobiography. So I don\u2019t know a single Christian, even those who have the highest opinion of the inspiration of Scriptures, who would use the term \u201cghostwriter\u201d, although a few use the weak joke of \u201cHoly Ghost writer.\u201d Was the New Testament written by volunteer ghostwriters? Why is the Old Testament silent on Jesus as God's son? Why do Christians call Jesus Son of God? The Bible says that God is an \"unchanging God.\" Then why do we see different faces of God in the Old Testament and the New Testament? If Jesus is the Son of God, then who is God? The New Testament was written by apostles, or other people drawing directly from what the apostles said. In some cases it\u2019s very easy to determine who wrote the document and what their relationship was to Jesus and the apostles. In other cases (for example, the letter to the Hebrews) it\u2019s not possible to be sure who wrote it. However, the consistency of the teaching with the rest of the Bible, and the witness of early church leaders whose letters we  do  have, mean that we can be sure the document is authentic and theologically consistent with what the apostles taught. There are many non-canonical documents, but their message is invariably suspect. This might be obvious to us, but more importantly it was suspect to the early church leaders. I trust their judgement, as they were only one or two generations removed from the apostles themselves. One or two documents (e.g. the Shepherd of Hermes) appear to be theologically sound but did not make it into the canon of the Bible, due to lingering doubts about authenticity by early church leaders. That\u2019s ok too. The important thing to remember is that Scripture is a witness to God\u2019s work in the world - and, in particular, serves as a witness to God\u2019s self-revelation in Jesus Christ. We should always be on guard against falling into bibliolatry - that is to say, making the Bible itself into a sort of idol. When we refer to \u201cthe word of God\u201d, we don\u2019t necessarily intend to mean that Scripture is a verbatim record of things that God said. Instead, we believe that Scripture points us towards God\u2019s revelation. It points to something other than itself. Thus, we simultaneously acknowledge that human words and witness are limited in their ability to convey the wholeness of God, while also recognizing that this witness is our primary vehicle for knowing who Christ is. I\u2019ll answer with another question. How do you know Socrates\u2019 words, as recorded by Plato, are Socrates\u2019 words? There are many more extant copies of New Testament writings than there are of Plato\u2019s writings. People discuss the meaning of the allegory of the cave, but I\u2019m not familiar with anyone questioning if the allegory was ever put forth at the time indicated. I\u2019m not a scholar in the Classics, so I might be mistaken. I do know that some have suggested that Socrates was a figment of Plato\u2019s imagination, but I believe that is not the canonical opinion. Further, no one purports that Jesus wrote anything; the purported authorship of much of the New Testament is stated in the documents themselves. Also, the term \u201cghostwriter\u201d is inexact because it implies that Jesus put himself out as the author of the New Testament, when in fact he did not. Ghostwriters write biographies in first person; that\u2019s not what is going on, here. I am not aware that any Christians think that God or Jesus wrote any of the New Testament. Typically, they (mistakenly) believe that there is something of great value in those words written by people who wrote things down decades after they were spoken. They also seem to give magical truth to things said by those writers despite the fact that Jesus would probably not agree with what they wrote. They also don't seem to appreciate the damage done in bad translations nor in selective political editing. How do they believe that it is all true? That is a very good question!",

More conplex and efficienct methods exist. DC Motor There are two main types of DC motors. Brush motors have physical contacts that are worn out over time. The other kind, brushless, actually use an inverter and an AC motor. If a laptop is always plugged in and charging, what is the effect on the battery? Can I power a 6v DC motor with a 9v battery?

I am assuming you are alluding to the problem that AC motors use AC, while batteries supply DC. The solution is to use a driving circuit for the motor that can take the DC from a battery and invert it into AC for the motor. In my experience cordless DC drills always have DC motors.

Why is God so different in the Old Testament than He is in the New Testament? What mystery? Any reputable history will tell you that the Canon of the New Testament (and Old) was settled at the Council of Rome in A.D. 382 by Pope St. Damasus I. The Old Testament was the Septuagint, as used by Our Blessed Lord, and the vast majority of quotes in the New Testament are from that version of the Scriptures. The New Testament was assembled from those readings which were used at Mass, and written before the death of the last apostle, St. Thomas, around A.D. 100. The Canon was settled at that point, and remained the same until the Council of Trent in the sixteenth century infallibly defined it under Pope St. Pius V against the Protestant revolutionaries who were throwing books out left and right, with which they did not agree. No mystery.",

        "a": "It probably depends on the make and model and year of the car. I can tell you that we did it routinely driving mountains where I grew up. Sometimes the descents were 1/2 hour of continuous grade and would burn out the brakes if we didn't do this: going downhill 45 or less, shift down using the gearshift to gear two. The vehicle makes the shift fairly smoothly to an engine rpm of about 5000 rpm. Then we would leave it in that gear for the steepest grades, shifting up as the grade lessened and we got bored Then shifting back down as the car went over 45. Very steep hills sometimes we went down to 1. All these cars lasted a long time. They seem to be designed for this usage. And it would have been abusive to ride the brake instead. Is it good to drive a car at low rpm at high gear with lower speed or better to drive at high rpm at low gear.? Does driving high speed on low gear damage the car? What are the 1.2.3 gears on a automatic car? What would happen if, while driving a car, you shifted the gear from D to P while still moving forward? When I'm driving a two wheeler I shift gears without disengaging the clutch. What is the effect of this on my two wheeler? Very much so. That sudden jump in RPMs doesn\u2019t do good things for your transmission, it doesn\u2019t do good things for your engine, and it puts a lot of strain not only on those, but on your entire driveline. In modern, electronically controlled transmissions, there\u2019ll often be programming which restricts the transmission from shifting outside of a certain RPM range in order to prevent exactly this from happening. Your question needs clarification. Which car are we talking about, which speed do you have in mind? And why do you want to shift down manually? I used to have a BMW 325i with a 170 hp engine and a 4 speed automatic gearbox. The car was capable of running 130 mph. Third gear would reach up to 100 mph. I remember that I shifted back from 4th into 3rd gear at speeds of 80 mph, in order to get more power and to keep the speed up when driving uphill. This particular engine needed revs to develop full torque. Other cars may behave differently. Yes it is. If you haven't noticed when you drive, every so often as you're accelerating the rpm drops. This is when the car changes gears to a more efficient gear ratio. A car\u2019s speed is measured by how fast the actual wheels are spinning which is connected to the engine. So let's say your gear ratio is 1:1 meaning 1 engine turn for every wheel rotation. If your wheel is only turning 10 times a second then so is your engine. If the wheel is 12 inches in diameter then you're going at exactly 10 times the circumference per second so that would be 10 pi feet per second. So what if you want to go faster? You either rev the engine up or get a better gear ratio that requires to engine to turn less than the wheels so instead of 1:1 your ratio becomes 1:3 so 1 engine turn for 3 wheel revolutions. I'm actually not quite sure what the order is but these ratios are for learning purposes only. Now that you change your ratio, you can essentially move 3 times as fast in the same rpm as earlier. Now reverse what I just told you. You're going fast and you change the gear ratio so the engine is less optimized. Your engine is gonna shoot up to some insanely high rpm that it may or may not be able to handle. If it goes too high above the redline you will face severe consequences Not if you don\u2019t mind forking over big bucks for a new or used transmission. I drive a Jeep that can automatically shift, or be shifted manually. 9 times out of 10, I let the Jeep do it\u2019s own shifting. I can drive a stick or an automatic, but, as the years pile on, I prefer an automatic.",

The aperture of the lens is small. Point object is considered. Incident and refracted rays make small angles. Consider a convex lens (or concave lens) of absolute refractive index m2 to be placed in a rarer medium of absolute refractive index m1.

This constitutes physical violence. Violence by speaking - Abusing, speaking lie that causes some damage, speaking words which makes other\u2019s life not good, words which offend someone constitute speaking violence. Mental violence - Thinking or making plans intentionally to destroy someone or something for our greed or profit and causing damage to people, Thinking bad about our elders, or people and this violence coming out in the form of anger is what that constitutes mental violence. The above three violence constitutes  BAD KARMA  when done  INTENTIONALLY . How can I avoid bad karma? How can bad karma be changed? Will I get bad karma if I sin? How bad is my karma? A2A to Tricia Labrie: What is the best way to clear bad karma? in karma nothing good and bad karma there. Karma is karma. no body can shift it, or change it. Even though karma is a different aspect of god, he is owner, creator or maintainer of karma, Ishwara, the creator cannot destroy it by him, till his death or till the mahapralaya, Hence while Ishwar born, he born with the Karma Circle. take a point, make several circles of it. Consider the first circle of it ends with 2nd circle and 2nd circle ends with 3rd circle, so on. where going out increases the pain by long rotation, where as inner one have less pain than that of outer one. Ultimately to reach the centre and creation ends. Here three chances are there. one is going along with the circles or tubes, ultimately reaches the Centre. Some times centre that is god may call you and see me. Sometimes by your bad attendance you may thrown out on outer circles. Hence here you are good and best guy, you can take the tubes and moves towards the truth, that is at centre. by your bad behaviour, when you do not meet the requirement of that particular tube, you, your self make a shift to outer tube. God likes you, you exited, it is a different object. Hence bad karma means not following the circles code and throwing out from the good circle to bad circle. Hence Karma is god Ishwara, himself. sitting at centre, playing with his magic Bad karma is just a phrasing, its actually just Karma, the consequences only lead to the phrasing, say for instance, a person who consumes copious amounts of sweet despite being warned not to, ends up sick, That would get termed as bad karma of that particular individual, same goes with people who give sufferings to others, would eventually get hit back due to the weight of their Karma, Everything needs to be balanced, hence there is positive, neutral and negative. When karma not related to well wishing of word and self profit then it\u2019s not a good karma and universe not get benefit from karma. Actually bad karma is nothing only is not a right karma. when you do karma then you just need to karma without self profit. Just think like you are doing work because this is god work and god give a change to you to do work.",

        "a": "If they ALL ran out right now, we\u2019d go back to a 16th -17th century type lifestyle. A much more local economy, far more people working on farms. as agriculture would be much more  human-effort plus horse and water wheel intensive.  Something like the Amish is the States. Of course it would be a very traumatic changeover. Remove oil-derived nutrients and mechanisation from the picture, and the food yield a farmer can obtain is about one third that possible using machinery, pesticides and fertilisers.  Moreover, the soil that is used in industrial agriculture is nutrient-deficient and compacted.   So without oil-based input it won\u2019t grow many crops. The bottom line is that without mechanism and fertiliser world food production will plummet. It would lead to a drastic decrease in world population. What's going to happen when all the oil runs out? What would happen if we ran out of gas now? What do you think would happen when we run out of fossil fuels? Will fossil fuels run out? If so, how can this be prevented? Did any guys who drive eighteen wheelers vote for Hillary? She has pledged to stop fossil fuel. Diesel engines in trucks run on fossil fuel. Hell on Earth, immediately. Ninety nine percent of the people, or even more, in most industrialized countries would be dead within a matter of a few days or weeks. Turn off the electricity, shut down the trucks, and there would be no water, no sewer , and no food in the city. People would be starving within a matter of days, and dying of thirst within a week or two. Contagious disease would be killing the remaining survivors off fast within a few weeks. Most people probably think they could find something to eat out in the country side, on farms, but most farms these days produce only a few specific crops, and the crops are ready for harvest only a few weeks out of the year, and there aren\u2019t many farms within walking distance of most cities. MY grand parents grew eighty to ninety percent of what they ate. When I was a kid, we grew more than half of our own food, but as a working farmer myself, I bought ninety percent or more of what my family ate at the supermarket. Growing food for family use is a great hobby, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot cheaper and more practical to just BUY what you need, even if you own the land and machinery and have the necessary gardening skills. If you have the land, and the skills, it can save you a lot of money, you eat healthier, and it\u2019s good exercise, but in terms of money, if you have a good job, you can earn money to buy food easier than you can grow your own. I couldn\u2019t grow an orange to save my soul, without building a greenhouse, and the veggie season where I live runs from June till late September. If I want a tomato in January , I have to buy one produced either in a greenhouse or someplace a thousand miles to the south of where I live. I grew apples and peaches, by the thousands of bushels. You can\u2019t live on either one of these fruits, and the peaches got ripe from early July thru August. The apples got ripe from August thru early October. All my production was sold and shipped within a few days of harvest. Anybody who might have come to my house to steal food would have found a few veggies grown in a backyard garden, during the summer. Otherwise, almost all the food in the house was something bought at a supermarket. I can earn enough money to buy a bushel of potatoes at a local farm market or supermarket in a tenth of the time it would take to grow a bushel. Gardening works as a hobby, and as a way to profitably use otherwise free time, but it\u2019s just not economic if you are a working farmer. People living in places that still have preindustrial economies that produce their food locally, and that don\u2019t depend on trucks or the electrical grid, etc, would still be ok, except for having to defend themselves from other people attacking them in order to obtain food. A small more or less self sufficient community of people that practices preindustrial agriculture wouldn\u2019t be able to defend itself from well armed and desperate invaders determined to rob them of whatever food they might have, and probably enslave them as well. Of course such invaders would have to arrive on foot or by bicycle or canoe etc, but they would have firearms, and there would be a lot of them, and they would be in a do or die situation. Steal food, at gun point, or starve themselves. A large community of such people might be able to organize an effective defense. That would surely be happening one day. And that\u2019s what the world is bracing itself for. Renewable energy. The way to go. Many EV cars are coming up. World is moving towards the energy produced through sunlight, wind and water. And by the time we master the art of renewable resources, these fossil fuels would have returned. Worst case, the world will end before the fossil fuels do. So, don\u2019t worry! For more automotive related knowledge, check out  Geeky Motorists Kudos! The same as  Thalbert McGinness' answer to What would happen if, all of the sudden, all of the oil (petroleum) in the world disappeared?  except it would take just a little longer as you are not deleting all of the other products of oil such as  Thalbert McGinness' answer to What are some products that come from oil? Disaster. It\u2019s going to take 10\u201320 years to phase in renewable energy. I bet we would go a lot faster in the event fossils went away. We would be limited to hydro, geothermal, nuclear and existing biomass, solar, and wind. We would drop back to about 1/3 of our current energy. There are no where near enough EV to make up the difference. Waste to fuels facilities exist, but are on the order of 1%. cane ethanol would work and we would drop our import tariffs on Brazil to get it. All the wasted time and effort on fossils would stop cold, and all those reserves would be applied installed solar and wind ASAP. A moonshot. It would be WWII rationing and production and in 5\u201310 years, we would be better off and renewable. I\u2019m an optimist.",

The founder also distinguishes a person from the other Executives and Employees that they all joined the venture after it was started. In some cases, founder(s) may not be CEO . From the point of view of starting a company or firm, you need to register with the appropriate authorities the initial shareholders ( usually the founders) and the board of Directors.

You do not need to start a website to write Founder in front of your name. You can just go out and print visiting cards with the Designation Founder. It is as easy as that. I have seen too many people with Founder visiting cards and without any working business model also. There is no official term as \u201cFounder\u201d It is just a term coined by people like to us to boost our ego. We started a little beer club in the college and called ourselves Founders of the Beer Club but the club failed to survived beyond a month. Do understand being a Founder is not about registering a company or developing a website. It is more of a feeling. It is when you believe you have started something. The idea may be a short lived one or go on to become a billion dollar company. You can be a Visiting Card Founder or be Founder of something good, its upto you When you feel confident of doing so. When you believe you have build something to showcase proudly to the same people to whom you want to project yourself as a founder. In Startup terms this is often called the MVP.

Most people know that their internet and phone calls can be intercepted, but they still research and plan crimes using these communications mediums, and often get caught. In a well controlled democracy, I think surveillance has its definite place in order to maintain law and order - but there also need to be watchers, watching the watchers - to make sure abuses of the systems do not occur.

THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be open for Jewish immigration and for the Ingathering of the Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.  http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreig... Here is what they committed to. A Jewish state by ethnicity, not religion. Therefore, one state wasn\u2019t even considered or promised. So, how could Israel honor a commitment it never made. The Declaration of the Establishment of Israel promised a constitution by October 1, 1948. Why was one never adopted? Is a 1 state solution possible in Israel? How was Israel able to win the Arab-Israeli War in 1948, standing alone against an alliance of five Arab states? Was this a victory against al... Is Israel committed to a two-state solution? How can one justify the occupation of Palestine? If Israel honored its 1948 commitment and adopted a written constitution that prohibits an official religion, would a one state solution be possible? Your question is fatally flawed because its premise is nonexistent. What \u201c1948 commitment\u201d are you even talking about? I\u2019m pretty familiar with the history of the region in that era and am not aware of any such \u201ccommitment\u201d to (A) adopt a written constitution OR to (B) prohibit an official religion. Please let us know what \u201ccommitment\u201d you are talking about, so we can disabuse you of your mis-impression of what it really means, whatever it is. Israel, like Britain, relies on a number of separate, fundamental documents as well as unwritten principles, as the basis for its form of government (that\u2019s what a \u201cconstitution\u201d is \u2014 the outline of a system of government). And in terms of religion, Israel does not have an official religion. Its government does give financial support to the orthodox rabbinate to decide family-law matters between Jew and Jew, and to run Jewish public schools, and so on. But Israel ALSO gives financial support to the Christian and Muslim and Druze and Baha\u2019i communities (and others) to decide family-law matters between members of THEIR religious groups, and to run their own public schools representing THEIR religious views as part of the curriculum, and so on. And adherents of EACH of those religions, as well as any other, are free to practice their beliefs openly, build places of worship, and so on. Israel believes strongly in religious freedom. Israel does have a Jewish  majority  of its population. And it has organized its civil calendar and public life around Jewish holidays and observances such as the Sabbath \u2014 much the way the U.S. has organized its civic life around the Christian calendar (oh, you mean you didn\u2019t KNOW? St. Gregory, 4th century, invented it) and holidays as well as Sunday observance. That does not mean the U.S. has any official religion, either. EDIT: In response to the critique of my answer in the answer posted here by Anonymous, as well as my guess (after seeing another similar question, which I already answered, here: Michael Jacobs' answer to The Declaration of the Establishment of Israel promised a constitution by October 1, 1948. Why was one never adopted? that the Declaration was the \u201ccommitment\u201d OP here was asking about, I still maintain that the Declaration, itself, was neither a \u201cpromise\u201d nor a \u201ccommitment\u201d to have a fully ready-to-adapt Constitution in place by October 1948 \u2014 for the reasons I stated in the above-linked answer. Also, don\u2019t forget THERE WAS A WAR GOING ON at the time which kind of kept the Knesset a bit busy, versus spending time drafting a new Constitution while the very existence of the new State was being actively fought against by their neighbors. In other words, if the hidden subtext of this question is to somehow undermine the legitimacy of the State of Israel or of its government, because they did not literally and promptly do all the things OP thought they made a \u201ccommitment\u201d to do in the Israeli Declaration of Independence, that\u2019s not going to happen. No, it would not matter. If the Knesset acted according to its initial purpose - to act as the elected constituent assembly [1]  and put together an Israeli constitution - the constitution drafted is not likely to differ dramatically from the current set of basic laws. As such, it would have limited impact. However, there was never a commitment to prohibit an official religion. Presumably, the question refers to the statement around equality: \u201c[The state of Israel] will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\u201d [2] Currently, the Declaration of Independence is  not  law - merely a \u2018guiding principle\u2019, as per the Supreme Court. [3] In a different political world, the provisions around equality in the Israeli declaration of independence - \u201c complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion\u201d [4]  -  would be part of the constitution as opposed to merely \u2018guiding principles\u2019 [5] , likely leading to better treatment of minorities, and more equal allocation of resources. However, in today\u2019s comparatively right-wing 20th Knesset, that is not likely to be a provision included in a putative constitution. Michael Jacobs and  Betty Daaf  inaccurately questions the premise of the overall question. The First Knesset was not intended as a parliament  - it was to be an Elected Constituent Assembly [6]  , tasked with writing and adopting a constitution for the newly-formed state. From the Israeli Declaration of Independence: \"We declare that after the termination of the British Mandate, from the 15 May 1948 and until elected authorities of the state would be established in accordance with  a constitution accepted by the Elected Constituent Assembly not later than October 1, 1948 \u2014the Provisional State Council would act as the temporary State Council, and its executive institution, the Provisional government of Israel, would constitute the temporary Government of the Jewish state, which would be named Israel.\" However, one of the first acts of the Constituent Assembly was to rename itself \u2018the Knesset\u2019, instead of the \u2018Elected Constituent Assembly\u2019. [7] Following this name change, it became a full-on Parliament in 1950 through the Harari decision. [8]  The first Knesset decided to change its mandate from being a constituent assembly to being a parliament, by downgrading the task of adopting the constitution. Instead of drafting a full constitution, the Knesset would gradually approve and enact \u2018basic laws\u2019 which - when completed - taken together would form the constitution of Israel. This was in 1950 - today in 2017, the \u2018basic laws\u2019 are not yet completed, and no constitution has been formed.

Paul wrote most of the New Testament. Paul was once a sinner and was against Christianity. Paul never dreamed that he would one day become a Christian, much less write most of the New Testament,\u2026 but God knew. \u2026 I suppose the best verses would depend on the ones that you understand most. I have a collection of my favorite Bible verses on Facebook and my friends post theirs that I adopt to go in my album. There are a lot of writers in the New Testament and they all were chosen by God to write what they wrote. They were also inspired by God to write what they wrote. There are things in the New Testament that only God would have known that long ago. infinitestructure.com Romans 8:19\u2014For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.

        "a": "The Earth gets gradually heavier as time goes on. The Sun emits heat and light by fusing hydrogen atoms into helium which also throws off protons and electrons, ionized particles that spread out into space. Most of those are deflected by the Earth\u2019s magnetic poles but even then about 20,000 tons of them get to Earth on a yearly basis. Sounds like a lot but compared to the mass of the Earth it\u2019s not even noticeable. The Earth is also \u2018pounded\u2019 daily by a barrage of micrometeorites. Most of these are just small pebbles or even dust from outer space that are pulled in by our gravity. The figure varies from time to time as we go through space in out orbit around the Sun and our solar systems travels around the galaxy but it averages about 60.000 tons a year. Every once in a while, say, half a million years or so, a big meteor might hit and deliver a few billion tons of new material, but fortunately for us that\u2019s very rare. It\u2019s been around that long since the last one though\u2026\u2026. All this spread out over a surface as large as the Earth might add a fraction of a nanometer to the diameter of the Earth every year. Far too slow to be noticeable. Now comes the negative. As the atmosphere heats up the molecules of gas gain more energy. The lighter gases especially, like hydrogen and helium, start to move faster and when they get enough energy they can escape the gravity and dissipate into space. We lose gas into space at about 100,000 tons per year. So, while the  size  of the planet, the rocky part that we live on, gradually gets larger and heavier every year, the total mass of the Earth gets smaller every year because we\u2019re losing a little bit more gas than we gain in solids every year. Even though global warming will speed the process up slightly, it will still take billions of years to use up all the atmosphere. It\u2019s highly unlikely the human race will live long enough for the loss of atmosphere to become a problem, something else, perhaps our own stupidity, is going to get us long before that happens. Is the earth getting heavier or lighter or does it stay the same? If I am at the bottom of a deep crevasse, am I lighter than on the surface of the earth? Or am I heavier? Why is hot water heavier than cold water? Is Earth's total mass reducing? What types of gases are heavier than air? As there was never a single point at which we would declare the Earth to have been \u201ccreated,\u201d there\u2019s no way to answer the question. The Earth formed by accumulating mass, and it still is to some slight degree. But the original mass at some point did lose a sizable fraction, which became the Moon. \u201cCreated\u201d is a misleading term. A more appropriate choice would be the word \u201cformed\u201d. It is likely that the earth formed over millions of years from an eddy of the accretion disk that formed the sun and all the planets. A local concentration of mass brought in nearby material until the very hot accumulation had enough gravitational attraction to form a sphere. Thereafter, it continued to gain mass as it swept clear the loose material that crossed its orbit. The composition of the moon supports the theory that a very large object impacted the earth with a \u201csplash\u201d of matter that then formed the moon. Was more or less material left on what would become earth? We do not know. The point is that depending on when you decide this large object we call earth was formed or created, there may have been many more asteroid impacts adding far more mass than is lost from the atmosphere, blown by solar winds into space. Life, human activity, mountain building and erosion do not change the amount of mass on the earth, but merely move around the mass already present. I think it\u2019s probably lighter because we think the moon was created from parts of the earth after some massive collision. But I have no way to know for sure. Obviously  it is heavier. Mass would have been added when the aliens implanted their seed on the planet.",

        "a": "The answer to this question depends on the design of the house. I\u2019ll deal with the possibilities from most to least desirable, based on the presumption that you have no ability or desire to resist the intruder with violence. For each of the rooms you might hide in, make sure that the intruder can\u2019t circle around and enter from a different angle, or at least ensure that all the doors lock. 1. Leave the house. If at all possible, get out of the house completely. The intruder more than likely has no desire for you, only for your stuff. Once you\u2019re outside and in the open, you have much more mobility and you can run to a neighbor, or some other safe location to call the police. Like everything else, this works best if you\u2019ve rehearsed it and you know where to go based on how the intruder is coming into the house. For example, if the intruder comes in through the back door, it may be best to leave through the front and cross the street to a neighbor\u2019s house. Don\u2019t be afraid to make noise. Make lots of noise. If you have a car, hit the panic button. When it\u2019s safe to do so, call the police. 2. Find a room with a metal door and door frame and deadbolt. Is possible, this door should open out, because doors are more difficult to breach if the door can\u2019t be kicked in. It would take a very determined intruder to break through such a door, because it would be a noisy, long process and that\u2019s time that could be spent stealing your stuff. Hit the panic button on your car keys and call the police. 3. Find any room with a deadbolt and a sturdy door. Failing that, any door that locks. Wooden doors are more easy to breach, but it\u2019s the deadbolt that makes the difference because regular locks and door chains are easy to break. It\u2019s better than nothing, and again the intruder probably doesn\u2019t care about you as much as the stuff you have. Hit the panic button on your car keys and call the police. If you\u2019re caught, comply with what the intruder demands and look for an opportunity to run away. Do not ever trust the intruder not to hurt you for complying. Women in particular are at risk for opportunistic rape. Stuff to keep in mind: In the U.S. at least burglars do a lot of planning ahead. They prefer houses with the master bedroom on the ground floor, an enclosed back yard with a tall fence, situated on the corner of a street so there\u2019s a blind spot to approach from. They want to show up when they spot big boxes for expensive items in your garbage, and at a time when you\u2019re not at home, i.e. when your car isn\u2019t in the driveway. In other places, like the U.K., burglars care a lot less whether anybody is home, because the occupants are a lot less likely to be armed. Am I more likely to kill an intruder or a family member with a gun in my house? Why is the power out in only one part of my house? Would a cat let you know if a human intruder is in the house? How can I be sure no one is hiding in my house? If I buy a house in the U.S., do I own the lot too? First and foremost you should make your house hard to get into. Steel doors, reinforced door frames, window locks, and good door locks are all good improvements. Exterior lighting, cameras, and alarms also make your house less likely be to targeted. Having the discipline to use those locks and improvements is also important: having deadbolt in a steel framed door doesn\u2019t make much sense if you leave the door open for cooling, or having an alarm system that is too much of a hassle to actually arm. There is nothing that says you can\u2019t put deadbolts on interior doors, or replace them with steel, or more reasonably, solid core wooden doors. Strategically placed bookcases are valuable for adding some ballistic protection and preventing bullets from travelling through the house. Having a plan to get out of the house, like locking an internal door and exiting through a window is preferable to hiding. The problem with this is that it\u2019s a one-person solution. If you have children, then you are going to have to get from where you are in the house to where they are to make sure you get them out of the house. Within the US the legal protections for using force are the greatest within your home. Get armed, clear the house enough to collect the people you care about, and exit. The one time it happened to me I was a young teenager of 14 or 15. I was sleeping on the top floor of the 3 story home. I had woken up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. I heard the intruder come in while I was in the bathroom. I squeezed myself into the small corner of space between the toilet and the shower wall so that if the intruder looked in the bathroom from the doorway he could not see me concealed behind the shower wall. I did not hear him leave so I stayed there shaking until dawn. I remember being afraid that I was shaking so profusely that I might \u201cknock\u201d on the wall and he would hear me. I also worried he would hear me breathing. I was pretty sure I knew who it was and that they were looking for me and not anyone else in the house and not a burglar. Even though I was pretty sure I knew who it was, an older boy of about 20, I was still terrified. I remember being too terrified to make a noise come out of my mouth, so screaming or even yelling was not likely an option or at least I remember thinking that at the time. Getting out altogether would be my first option. I am often in strangers homes doing an Open House and the first thing I do when entering is unlock the rear door or side door on the same level as the front door to provide an easy escape. I have had a few insecure and somewhat awkward moments that helped me discover that \u201cstaging\u201d people\u2019s furniture to be sure I wouldn\u2019t be trapped in to any room by furniture is helpful and necessary. Luckily the only time I was in danger it was because the owners forgot to take the dog out. I opened a bedroom door as I also open all doors in the house and woke the dog who was sleeping on the bed. Luckily I startled him enough that by the time he lunged at me I was able to shut the door with him in the room. I still ran out of the building as fast as I could. The problem with hiding is you are trapped and then you panic and then you shake and maybe breath heavily and then you fear that the person will hear you and the panic grows and grows. So getting out is better than hiding in my opinion for that reason, having had the experience. The terror I experienced while hiding was likely worse than the actual incident. The only internal door that locks, and thus gives you extra time to call 911, is the bathroom. There is also some tile to protect you a little. On the downside, there is not usually any alternate egress. If you can exit any way possible, that is the best strategy, assuming you have neighbors, an open business district, or a decent chance to run away. If an intruder came into my house, I\u2019d do what I did the last time an intruder came into my house: make it clear that I knew that the intruder were there, and that it would be better for everyone if the intruder left as quickly as possible. The reason I don\u2019t specify where I would hide is due to the physical configuration of my home, which is not a subject I choose to give detail about on Quora.",

So academics alone doesn\u2019t cut it in the admissions game anymore. You need a hook, a spike, a way to stand out in the crowd of outstanding high school students with impressive academic credentials. Start the process of deciding what your hook is by asking yourself how are you different (in a good way) from the typical Stanford applicant who is a valedictorian or a class president or a captain of the football team or women\u2019s lacrosse team? Why would Stanford want you and not them? Can you state your case in an interesting and compelling way on your essay and responses to Stanford\u2019s supplemental questions? If you blow these off, you can pretty much assure yourself of a rejection email. Do you understand the Stanford culture and can you convince the admissions office that you are a perfect fit for this culture? You need to organize your entire application around this one principle - you will bring value to Stanford. Your letters of recommendation need to support this notion. Your narrative needs to expose in an interesting and thoughtful way the value you will bring. We already know you are an outstanding student.

He just asked them for  1 Test Match  before him declaring his retirement gracefully, but they refused (while they continued playing Sachin at that time, despite his continuous failures). They obviously did not even give him a farewell. People talk about Tendulkars, Laxmans, Dravids, Gangulys, But they do not realize that  this Man made the Indian Cricket Team fearless and made Beasts like Shoaib Akhar fearful.  In my opinion,   it   is because of him that Indian Cricket Team developed the attitude to win all major tournaments (Not taking anything   away from MSD who guided such fearless characters calmly). Fact : In World Cup 2011,  Sehwag hit all first balls of first over for 4 till the Semi Finals  (that's 8 consecutive first ball 4\u2019s). I don't think we will ever again come across such a Fearless Batsman. EDIT : Jason Roy, the English opener was asked about the changed attitude of the English batting order after their poor performance in World Cup 2015. His response was that they just decided to go there and  express themselves like Sehwag,  without worrying about anything. This shows the impact Sehwag created on World Cricket. How many cricketers had beautiful wife? What are some of the best (or worst) instances of sledging in cricket? What are the worst things that Cricket fans do off the field? Who is the worst Indian cricket player ever? Who do you think is the best captain the Indian cricket team has ever had? Why? As of now I see 4 people have written answer on who got the worst farewell. 4 of them have given names of 4 different  Indian  players. They are: Virender Sehwag VVS Laxman MS Dhoni Rahul Dravid I feel the answers are a bit biased. Going by the literal meaning of the question the  worst and brutal  farewell if given to any cricketer it was Jason Gillespie. Ask why? Because this Australian bowler who played the innings of his life while batting was dropped in the next series and never pplayed for Australia again. Gillespie was a good bowler but not as good a fast bowler as compared to his teammates- Glenn McGrath,Brett Lee and Nathan Bracken. Let me describe the scenario Australia was playing a test match against minnows Bangladesh on Apr 16-20, 2006. Bangladesh batted 1st and scored 197 runs all out Gillespie took 3 wickets in 5 overs. In Australia\u2019s 1st inning he was sent as night watchman he batted and scored 201. Australia declared at 581. In the 2nd inning Bangladesh got all out for 304. The Aussies won the match. The Man Of The Match - Jason Gillespie Man Of The Series - Jason Gillespie And  BOOM!!  the next thing Cricket Australia did was to drop him. So in my view Gillespie\u2019s farewell is the worst I know. Scorecard of Gillespie\u2019s last match. 2nd Test: Bangladesh v Australia at Chittagong, Apr 16-20, 2006 | Cricket Scorecard | ESPN Cricinfo For the most of my childhood i\u2019ve seen scorecards like this IND 52\u20131 , 4.2 , gambhir*0, sachin* 4 . You can see a storm has ended just then. Btw you should have guessed who i\u2019am about to talk. Virendar sehwag had the worst farewell by his standards. For the man who has hit 23 centuries in tests and 15 centuries in ODIs. This man is no way less than the greats of his era. He remained india\u2019s strength at the top for more than 11 long years. For a man who holds no fear and always holds his head high with the bat , i think the bcci has let him down. A farewell match would have been the least that they could \u2019ve done. If they felt he is not needed anymore then they should have informed him and given a farewell game. He quoted the same in his press conference. You can love sachin, You can love dravid more, But never can you hate this man. A true virender with a bat.!! There are many but there is only one who had the worst retirement farewell and he is Virendra Shewag, BCCI never gave him any acknowledgment or any life time achievement momentum but he will be remembered as the most fearless and aggressive opener of all time in Cricket Era. If here exist any T20 format his batting style may contributed something to the person who come up with this idea of T20 format. He was and is the best entertainer of all time in cricket history of India and he deserved a farewell at least. The worst farewell given was for Rahul Dravid. He is considered to be among the greater to ever grace the cricket field. The finest of the finest ,The icon, India's second highest run getter. A player who could bat on any fucking minefield. Served Indian cricket in every possible way. Kept wickets , chipped in a few overs at the start of his career, opened batting. Even after dedicating his life for Indian Cricket Bcci didn't even take one in thousand effort given for Sachin farewell to give this legend a deserving farewell.

        "a": "challenges in Agile testing The fact that Agile methodology has achieved mainstream status is clearly supported by anecdotal evidence and surveys, such as one by VersionOne in which 84 percent of respondents replied in the affirmative that their organization was indeed employing Agile development methods. As Agile development eclipses Waterfall methodologies for software development, it has stirred up some distinct challenges in its wake for testing organizations. 1.Changing Requirements Changing requirements or dropping stories mid-sprint is not uncommon in agile projects. This can be a nightmare for the whole team as it means that the work already carried out might be scrapped completely or changes should be made to what\u2019s already half done. 2. Not Enough Information on the Story There will be times when a product owner who writes user stories, has some idea about a new feature but doesn\u2019t have all the details to write a good set of acceptance criteria to fully define the behaviour of the feature. They ask the development team to create a prototype so they can get more ideas about the functionality and behaviour of the feature. 3. Continuous Testing In agile, testing is not a phase, it\u2019s an activity. Testing starts from the very beginning, even before the development starts. In order to have a smooth ride during the sprint, the stories in the backlog should have been elaborated during the story grooming sessions. This means the QA should collaborate with product owners to learn the details of the story and then help write good acceptance criteria. 4. Technical Skills / Test Automation Working in an agile environment, means that the testers should be technically competent to help the developers with Integration Testing and API Testing, as well as scripting UI automation checks with Selenium or similar tool.If the testers come from a purely manual or exploratory background, they will find it difficult to keep-up with the pace of delivery as they need to test on a continuous testing. 5. Multiple Browsers / Multiple Devices Nowadays, the architecture of many websites consists of a \u201cback-end\u201d and a \u201cfront-end\u201d. The front-end piece is largely based on JavaScript and CSS which could potentially behave differently when viewed from different browsers or devices. 6. Communication No matter how good the process is or how well the above items are carried out, if there is a lack of communication amongst the team members or with product owners, designers, etc, nothing will work. 7. Resource Management The Agile approach requires a mixture of testing skills, that is, test resource will be required to define unclear scenarios and test cases, conduct manual testing alongside developers, write automated regression tests and execute the automated regression packages. As the project progresses, specialist skills will also be required to cover further test areas that might include integration and performance testing. There should be an appropriate mix of domain specialist who plan and gather requirements. The challenging part in the Resource management is to find out test resources with multiple skills and \u00a0allocate them.",

Real Madrid could win their 33th La Liga title and the first one since 2011/12 with Jose Mourinho as manager. If they win the title, Real Madrid will end their longest streak without winning La Liga (four seasons) since 1994 (also four). Lets see the last 5 fixtures result between Malaga and Real Madrid. Real Madrid  2  -  1  Malaga Malaga  1  -  1  Real Madrid Real Madrid  0  -  0  Malaga Real Madrid  3  -  1  Malaga Malaga  1  -  2  Real Madrid Clearly we can say that by seeing last 5 fixtures between them that Malaga has given very tight competition to Real Madrid but Los blancos only need 1 point from available 3 points that means if last match is drawn also still Real Madrid will win La-Liga. Lets see some key facts >>> Real Madrid have only lost once in their 15 La Liga games against Malaga CF at La Rosaleda (W9, D5).

It matters on the difficulty of the paper  i.e, if it's very difficult the correction will be linient and if it's easy it'll be strict.

Can you show me any connection between Millenium Prices and end of world discussion? End of World claims have been around for millennia, usually used by religious or pseudo-religious leaders to gather their sheep behind them. And as long as they find the idiots to follow them, it will not stop. Just good that people in general have stopped listening to that crap. And I doubt that any of these religious bigots has ever studied even basic math, let alone have reached a level of understanding that he (usually men, no gender bias at this point) could even comprehend what the Millennium Problem list was all about.",

        "a": "This is a question which can draw a wide spectrum of answers. I am not very much inclined to a specific person but it will be highly welcomed if next President of ours is a apolitical figure. This has been tried with APJ Abdul Kalam Azad & he was the best President of India if you ask me. A non political person will be more acceptable to the common masses & will be free of controversies. If Advani or Murli Manohar Joshi are elected, & charges against them prove to be right, Government will be facing a hard time. I am talking about BJP leaders because we kinda know that BJP is easily going to get their candidate elected. All the ruckus by opposition is just to build a united front against BJP which can form a base after presidential elections. To name a specific person, I will suggest Indian business tycoon & philanthropist Azim Premji. Chairman of Wipro Ltd. known as the Czar of Indian IT industry is the second richest man in India. And he has agreed to donate more than half of his wealth for the betterment of the country. He is also the founder of Azim Premji foundation which is well known for its work in imparting education among children. His father was invited to settle in Pakistan by Jinnah after 1947 partition. He turned down his request & chose to stay in India. This might be a sweet cherry on the top fact for Azim Premji. Who will be the President and Vice President of India in 2017? Who would you want to see as the next president in India, L.K. Advani or Mohan Bhagwat? Who will be the next president of India in 2017 ? Could Pranab Mukherjee stand for PM post now that he is the President? He deserves to be one. Whom do you want to be the next president of India? I have the distinction of following politics since Kalam is our president. We know President of India is the powerful person in the country and he has control over executive body, judiciary, legislative, appointments, diplomacy et cetera. But we also know that he can't exercise these powers to the fullest without the help of Legislative body. That's why we refer him as rubber stamp in our minds. But after Kalam ji became the president we changed this thinking and i can proudly say that '  I am there when kalam is President of India '. And then regarding Prathiba patil and Pranab the less said the better. Kalam brought grace and sheen to the presidency and continued the dignity maintained by previous presidents(except Fakruddin Ali who approved emergency). I still remember the passion in him to inspire people through lectures in universities, colleges and in schools. He became a role model for the people. I can speak on and on regarding the good things done by him. I want the presidential chair which has immense power and chance to inspire a generation to be seated by  Mr.Jaya prakash Narayana , a retired IAS officer and a well know activist who is leading Loksatta party. People outside Andhra Pradesh and Telangan might not be knowing him, but he is the driving force in various contributions and a few are mentioned below. 1. Criminal disclosure law which mandates all the candidates filing nominations to disclose any criminal laws pending against them. 2. Limiting the size of cabinet in Legislature 3. Fighting for political reforms like Right to information and lokpal bill. Also, he is untroubling in nature and influence people by his conduct of behaviour rather than mere speeches(unlike Sashi tharoor). And most important thing he stresses on the important issues like Education reforms, Health reforms, skill development, employment generation and the like which our politicos typically neglect. BJP has the lead now in appointing the President of India. Hope they select a good candidature like they did last time. I think Noble laureatte \u201cKailash Satyarthi\u201d would be good choice. Oh, I also need to reason it. He is a noble laureatte is a enough reason I think, and I like social workers in politics influencing position. Well, Awards and Honours: source:  Kailash Satyarthi - Wikipedia Satyarthi has been the subject of a number of documentaries, television series, talk shows, advocacy and awareness films. [33] Satyarthi has been awarded the following national and international honours: 2015: Harvard's University Award \"Humanitarian of the Year\" [34] 2015: Honorary Doctorate by  Amity University, Gurgaon [35] 2014:  Nobel Peace Prize [6] 2009: Defenders of Democracy Award (US) [36] 2008: Alfonso Comin International Award (Spain) [37] 2007: Gold medal of the Italian Senate (2007) [38] 2007: recognized in the list of \"Heroes Acting to End Modern Day Slavery\" by the US  State Department [39] 2006: Freedom Award (US) [40] 2002:  Wallenberg Medal , awarded by the  University of Michigan [41] 1999:  Friedrich Ebert Stiftung  Award (Germany) [42] 1998: Golden Flag Award (Netherlands) [43] 1995:  Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award  (US) [44] 1995: The Trumpeter Award (US) [45] 1994: The Aachener International Peace Award (Germany) [46] [47] 1993: Elected  Ashoka Fellow (US) [48] I think this is enough. Rest can be read in Wikipedia It\u2019s not simply for what I like, but I have to take the realistic approach & need to make a list of check points, based on which I can zeroing on one name, so that I can choose the name among the person who have any chance to become a President. Below is the check list;  1.\tWe can choose among the list of famous & well known people only 2.\tThat person should be from BJP camp but also have common acceptability 3.\tThe person should be above 60 years of age  4.\tThe person should be well educated and have information of various fields 5.\tThe person must have some interest or say inclination in the political matters 6.\tThe person must not be holding any post of profit currently which would create the conflict of interests 7.\tAnd obviously I would like to see it from outside world only & not belongs to any political party On the basis of above points, I can remove all the business persons because this would create conflict of interest.  From sports side we only have cricket in mind and their attractions remain till they play that means any such old cricketer which is still famous and in their 60s is not coming to my mind except Mr. Gavaskar.  Then we remain with the person related to art fields like Movies, Music, Painting basically the person related to Bollywood, so one name which is flashing in BIG letters is of BIG B or Mr. Amitabh Bachchan.  Now among Mr. Gavaskar and Mr. Bachchan, I would like to see Mr. Bachchan of course on the post of honorable President. President is the Nominal Head of Country. He is a rubber stamp only. Advice of Council of Ministers ,Headed by PM is binding on President. So in Indian Political system no matter who becomes President whether Pranab Daa or Sh.L K Adavani To contest election for President political support rather than quality is much required. Jai Hind.Jai Bharat.",

        "a": "Hard to say, it depends on who\u2019s you\u2019re talking about: For electrical engineers like me, continuity, Dc volts, AC volts, and CURRENT For an appliance repairman, Voltages and continuity. For a homeowner, AC Volts from chacking AC Mains outlets, DC volts for checking batteries, and continuity for checking switches and cables For the company that makes it, that is sell in large numbers and they make a good profit. What are the most common uses for FPGA today? How do I use a multimeter to test for continuity? How do we identify the emitter, collector and base of a transistor by using a multimeter? Is it a good idea to use rechargeable 9V battery in multimeter? How do I measure the resistance of an LDR using a multimeter? Multimeters and their plethora of functions are an essential tool for an electronic engineer. Each function is useful. The first multimeter I used was called an \u201cAVO\u201d. This is what they looked like: AVO model 8 universal multimeter Most functions were useful. AC volts and current were not as useful, because they were not true RMS. Having relatively low input impedance, they were fun to use, as you had to adjust what you read on the meter by what you calculated would be the loading of whatever range you selected. Life is so much better now that most meters are true RMS, and usually to 20kHz. But I wouldn\u2019t mind owning an AVO, just for fun. I have also driven a Soviet era Volga - that too was fun - fun in the same way. I have three multimeters now. 1) An 8000 count classic Chinese \u201crip-off\u201d of a high end Fluke meter that beats most \u201cFluke\u201d meters for performance and accuracy but at a fraction of the cost. I love that it has inductance ranges down to 800uH, as well as capacitance ranges down to 8nF. There are two things this meter doesn\u2019t have. I have only seen these on a \u201ctop-of-the-line\u201d Fluke. One is to be able to see dc and ac readings on the display, at the same time, and the other is to have a low resistance range (eg 20, 40, 50, 60 ohms max), so that it can measure resistances (in differential mode) down to about +/-10millohms. The latter feature does not make it a milli ohmeter (which can be very useful, but they are as rare as hen\u2019s teeth) but such a feature does bridge the gap between a multimeter and a milli ohmeter. 2) A basic multimeter with a reasonable 6000 count accuracy, and a clamp type current meter (600A). Similar to this: Clamp Meter AC/DC - Weidmuller 3) And a not very accurate multimeter (maybe 1000 or 2000 count at best) that also has a basic two channel 60MHz storage CRO. I also have an old Tek 500MHz 4-channel CRO, but I tend to use this small one more often. I use them all. And I have used all functions on all. The clamp meter isn\u2019t capable of measuring accurately below 600mA, so the first is best for that. But if I want to measure reasonable current, the latter is best, because I can take one meter (on a plane for example) and do almost everything. Clamp current meters are great for measuring current. But, as important a tool, that multimeters are, the most important tool for an electronic engineer is information, So a laptop or tablet computer and/or a largish smartphone are essential. This is some examples of the reference texts that I used to carry around with me, from job to job, before the internet began carrying so much useful engineering data: And at every electronic design centre there would have been 3\u20136, 180cm x 90cm (6\u2032 x 3\u2032) bookshelves with manufacturer\u2019s data. Data on passives, semiconductors, and ICs. But now. all of this reference material and data is available with a few keystrokes on my Piixel XL. So, before any other tool, an electronic engineer needs access to the internet. But back to things used by hand, an electronic engineer needs a range of screwdrivers (slotted, Philips, Torx), metric and imperial allen keys, T-piece drivers, dental tweezers, a vernier, scalpel, fine pliers and cutters, maglamp, a wire stripper, and several multimeters. And a camera to take photos for reports (again - on his phone) And for digital and/or sub 300MHz analogue, they will need several CROs as well. Worthy mentions are an IR thermometer with dual lasers, and a waveform generator (sine, square, pulse, sawtooth, arbitrary, etc) If they do rf, and/or audio work, and can afford it, several spectrum analysers covering audio to whatever upper freq range they work at times 9 (to look for the 9th harmonic), and a low noise Signal Generator. And if they are really well off - their own Network Analyser. Alas, when I do rf work, I have to use OPs (Other People\u2019s gear) But I would love to have my own RF equipment set. A multimeter most important use is as a bunch of different meters all packed into one. There was a time not long ago when someone packed a meter to measure voltage, another to measure current, one to measure low resistance and another to measure high resistance. Each one was twice the size of a modern digital multimeter and came in it\u2019s own nice leather case. As progress marched forward, people kept finding ways of combining two functions and leaving one meter at the shop. I remember how excited I was to find a new multimeter that included frequency measurement. Now I had the problem of what to take with me in the space that the frequency counter took up. I quickly found out it should be a spare multimeter or two. So the multimeter is like a Swiss Army Knife or one tool to in the darkness bind them. Oh, that reminds me, back lighting. Very important when you are fixing the developing tank that broke just as you got out those old undeveloped film rolls you have of bigfoot. Oh wait\u2026do you know about photographic film and dark rooms? For me the most important uses are these: Voltage. I want to know if a PSU is working or not before I start dismantling any machines only to find there\u2019s nothing wrong. Also polarity. If I need to replace an external PSU on something, I want to be sure the polarity is set right. Continuity. Especially in co-ax cables. Resistance. If I can\u2019t see clearly what the stripes on a resistor are, I measure it. Current. I never use this at work but I do when I\u2019m making or repairing something for myself. Temperature. Really handy thing to have to find out if your chips are running too hot. But other people might have a different outlook. There  is  no \u201cmost important use\u201d. Currently, as I have no electronics projects, most of the time I use mine to check battery voltage on AA cells, or check wires for continuity.",

        "a": "How do you find people willing to invest in small business ideas? Bottom line,  Muyiwa Ogundare  is correct. You don\u2019t. So let\u2019s redefine your question. Investment is a way that business is funded such that the investor owns a piece of the business with an opportunity to achieve far greater returns in the future. Ideas never get investment, there\u2019s nothing there. Small businesses rarely get investment as small businesses tend not to deliver outsized returns at future dates (meaning getting acquired or IPO). Small businesses typically provide services  or  variations on familiar products and thus when they deliver returns to investors, those returns are around 2\u20135x revenues. Keep in mind, that\u2019s still  when and if . So if you have an ongoing business and not just an idea, you can find investors but keep in mind you\u2019re likely only going to appeal to investors if your small business is of the nature that it will get acquired. This is why you see investment in more innovative and disruptive developments, indeed even new physical products in CPG and such (not just tech), because completely new beverages, fidget spinners, and web services, are likely to deliver 5\u201310x returns on investment - when and if acquired or IPO. New and disruptive ideas are considered startups, not small businesses, and investors are inclined to bet on the higher outcome given the roughly similar rate of failure between small business and startup (90% or so) - which is to say, I\u2019ll take a 10% chance at a 10x return every time compared to a 10% chance of a 4x return. What I suspect you\u2019re really asking is how you get capital for a small business and capital for small businesses usually comes by way of  financing , not funding (investment). Funding refers to my giving you money, to fund what you\u2019ve built in exchange for ownership, such that I\u2019ll get the greater value of my ownership back. That\u2019s investment. It\u2019s not really that different from investing in stocks - owning shares of the company in hopes that in the future they are worth more\u2026. people relatively rarely buy stocks in publicly traded small businesses (Small Cap companies) for the reasons we\u2019ve touched on above :) SOME do but the rate of return is typically smaller or the risk greater. Financing refers to my giving you money, to fund what you\u2019ve built in exchange you giving me my money back plus more, over time. Lots of different ways you can secure financing for a small business (and yes even ideas): bank loans, credit cards, personal loans from friends, crowdlending, and convertible debt (which is essentially a loan until certain characteristics of the business are met such that the loan converts to an investment so that you don\u2019t have to pay it back\u2026 because ownership is established). Where do you get people willing to give you money for a small business idea?  You offer them the terms of the loan. I have a great idea and no money or knowledge on how to get it started. How do I find someone to invest in my invention? How do I build my small idea into a business? I would like to start a small business online. I have a few ideas but not a lot of money. What are some ideas for new businesses which require... What are small business ideas for teens? What are some of the business ideas for a small investment in a small town? Targeting the right people: People are always ready to invest if the returns are good. To start out any business you should try to reach out your close friends and family who have some extra savings with them and you can repay them with your day job. ( Note: I am suggesting to get a debt from close people which you can repay easily. Don't take debt which you can't repay in worst scenario.) Live examples: Let me tell you, how I got interested in some businesses where I had invested my money because I was confident I can earn from it. I have invested with a Bike rental startup:  I am a aggregator for them with a three year contract model. Where they send me every month earning and revenue earned. Shared property investment:  Being from  construction and real estate background  , I have some knowledge about the industry so I have invested with other investors in real estate because I understand the financial feasibility of the project. Car rental investment So I was always ready to invest in avenues where ROI is good, but finding the right opportunity with the right people is the key. If you are passionate about something and can really provide returns to share holders, sky is the limit. Just work out your plans well, discuss with mentors. Network with people and go scale it. Investors really don\u2019t invest in ideas: they invest in businesses. Once you have an idea that has been turned into a going enterprise, investors will consider an investment. There are millions of ideas but only some of them will actually become businesses with a sound product that people will purchase. Investors want to know that the founder has done the work and proven that the product and market both exist and are a match in order to make money over the long run.",

It\u2019s similar to billiards ball game where one doesn\u2019t have the control on opponents tactic. It\u2019s a game of patience and pressure tactics, a hard core strategist , a mixed ball of defensive and offensive tactics. These tactics need to be calculative , strategic and calibrated risk. Each small move has an opposite repercussion. Each repercurssion has a major or minor effect. This effect is calculated and can be mobilised in an certain manner. Within the game , there are number of games. The sub game , that has the major effect is the effect is that of behaviourialism ., which kills the opponent, defeat the opponent without any move. This move. The reason why chess is given such an ultimate position is because of its uncertainty of which player would be winning. Its not about losing about a pawn or and player. The ultimate thing is the result . As a pawn can change itself to become a queen and quite similarly the change the whole dynamics of game. Thus you can never say that won the ultimate game unless you checkmate the player. Some ogf the characterstics that you need to follow You need to have a supra long defensive position so that you your king can never be at vulnerable position. Patience is one of the most important thing , that can frustrate the other player and make him do the mistake. The context. of this article us the increasing geo political, geo economic and geo strategic power game olayed between Each move is important and while moving each move you need to have the reason why you have put that move and secondly what would be the repercussion The next important thing is you need to know the pychology of the other player, what the other player wants to achieve. To sum up, chess provides tactics and strategies to have a realistic position of the enemy ir competitors. In the world of realisim and complex interdependence , india china is cooperaing and competiting at the same time. Geopolitics India china is not only cooperaing but at certain position have adverse stance. For ex there is a geo political turf in central asia , west asia, africa and more importantly south asia and south east asia. China is supporting taliban in Afghanistan and having a muscular stance in south east asia and also assertive in regional situation as well. The current scenario doesn't dole a peaceful stance for indo china relations in the near future. There is a possibility of increasing incursion at the border and assertion for arunachal pradesh . There are also evidence of china having a role in deteriorating the internal security situation in north east and also playing a second fiddle by supporting the fringe elements in Pakistan. It is important for India to assert itself stronger and should be cautious as Tsun su said' if you cannot nip his plans in the bud, or disrupt his alliances when they are about to be consummated, sharpen your weapons to gain the victory How does the US make their foreign policy? Who are the closest allies of Pakistan? What does it mean in foreign policy that Russia plays \"chess, not checkers?\" What is the importance of foreign policy? How does Iran view India? \u201cChess\u201d and \u201cGo\u201d are both games that that encourage tactical and strategic thinking. Go (game) - Wikipedia Go  is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in ancient China ... While nothing can substitute for actual combat, both Chess and Go are useful tools for learning some of the basics of tactical and strategic thinking. Chess is being used as a five-penny analogy in these contexts. Many of us have a romantic image of white-haired brainiacs engaging in a battle of minds over a chess board. It is an appealing image and it is tempting to imagine that strategy and foreign policy are similar. It is easy to think of Ms. Merkel and Mrs. May engaging in an idealized battle of wits over Brexit. This makes for easy headlines. Chess being similar to foreign policy or strategy is an appealing image but it is a fallacy. I'll let you in on a secret: foreign policy or strategy are not like chess. They are messy, the rules are not well-defined, there is incomplete information. Heck, even the objective may not be known beforehand. Furthermore, the skills required are not the same. I've worked with people who are FAR better than me in chess, yet I was the better corporate strategist. I've also worked with people that I could handily beat in chess that outstrategized me without breaking a sweat. Because the game makes you have to think ahead like in real life , he moves a piece there i move a piece here to counter that piece. Its like this you keep from getting destroyed and wait for the enemy to make a mistake, you get what i\u2019m taking about?",

        "a": "Skin depth is the result of current flowing in a material and the magnetic field that current generates. It varies with the frequency because, while the inductance of surfaces is determined only by their size, the impedance of that inductance increases with frequency, and it is a characteristic of inductance that it generates a potential in the current induced by impinging EMF. Practical materials aren\u2019t purely conductive, so the resistive component of impedance, which appears in series with the inductive and lowers the current, tends to reduce the amount of counter-EMF. This can be seen looking at  a table  of relative resistivity, skin depth and frequency. Another effect shown in that table is due to magnetic permeability, as ferrous materials increase the inductance of a conductive material. What is surge impedance loading? Why do we need a high input and a low output impedance in an amplifier? What is use of impedance matrix? What is meant by arc impedance? What does 32 ohm of impedance mean for headphones? By T.L. I assume you refer to a transmission line. In any conductor the resistivity can be defined as: rho = R.l/A where rho is the resistivity, R is the resistance l is the length and A is the cross sectional area. Due to a phenomenon called the skin effect, higher frequency currents tend to flow closer to the surface of the conductor (low skin depth) resulting in a much lower effective cross-sectional area hereby increasing the impedance of the conductor at these depths. Large currents with harmonics (superimposed signals at multiples of the power frequency e.g 50/60 Hz) often cause overheating in motors and transformers as a result of this under abnormal operation. Currents that flow at the center of the conductor e.g. D.C. Experience a bigger cross sectional area of the conductor thereby resulting in a lower impedance.",

        "a": "They're mythical, or at the most characters in an extended metaphor or allegory. They spoke whatever language the person thinking about them happens to be thinking in. Were Adam and Eve saved? Did they go to heaven? If no, would they have gone to heaven if they had not sinned? What language did Adam and Eve speak in the Garden of Eden? Were Adam and Eve married or are we all bastards? What continent were Adam and Eve on first? Were Adam and Eve the first humans on Earth? If not, who did Cain marry? Some Bible scholars would like to label the language that Adam and Eve spoke as  Adamic . But their attempt to put such a label doesn\u2019t exactly offer any meaning or functional description of the language at all, in my opinion. But what is Adamic language, anyway? I think it pertains to the classical Hebrew. The people who speak Hebrew are the Jews. Based on the Midrash (a Jewish commentary on specific passages in the Hebrew Scripture, Tanakh), Adam spoke Hebrew because the names he gave Eve (\" Isha \" and \" Chava \") in the book of Genesis 2:23 and Genesis 3:20) only make sense in Hebrew. Still, some individuals claim  \u201cShem\u2019s (Noah\u2019s son) language would remain the same as it had been previously, the \u2018one language\u2019 that had existed from Adam onward. (Read: Genesis 1:11) This would mean that the language that eventually came to be called Hebrew was the one original tongue of mankind.\u201d The only possible answer is to say we don\u2019t know. There is no documented evidence of what language they may have spoken nor does the Bible say. Adam and Eve were characters in a story that was written by primitive people who didn\u2019t understand how languages change over time. Consider the story of the Tower of Babel - all people spoke the same \u201cprimordial language\u201d, and the god of the Bible changed that to a group of separate languages so the people could not cooperate to cause mischief. That \u201cprimordial language\u201d was the language spoken by Adam and Eve, as well as all of the characters from other stories that came after them, but before Babel. Hebrew.",

Five months are quiet enough for both groups. Consistent study 10\u201312 hrs each day. Remember study material is for study and practice manual is for practice.students study from practice mannual and basics go wrong. For practical subject you have to solve sums and not to read them.You have to reduce number of sums by the end of exam.While studying first time if your sum is right you don't need to solve again.You have to mark new adjustments,tough sums. If at the first time out off 10 sums 2 will right ,in next revision 6 will right and remaining 4 sums are those wich you have to revise day before exam. For theory I can say just one word revision .YOu have to revise what you studied day before. You have to do mock test papers and RTP. You can start study with class notes but don't forget to see have your teacher covered all sums of study material. Give mock test series.Or join portion wise test series at your place.Or you can solve papers at your home and compare with suggested answer.But I will suggest to join test series at any class whichever is available.

How do I plan a strategy to top CA Exams? If I want to give November 2017 attempt of CA final, when is the last date to register? Plan your studies. Identify the subjects which are your strengths\u200b and weaknesses\u200b. Have daily plans of studies and stick to it. Rather than reference materials prefer institute materials (i.e. Study material and practice manual). Analyse papers of past 4\u20135 attempts and understand the pattern of the institute and the way questions are being asked. Have writing practice also. Rather than doing single subject in a whole day try to do two or three subjects. Be passionate to clear your exam. Keep your self motivated and have firm determination to crack the exam. Evaluate your daily achievement of planning. Write 3\u20134 papers of each subject in about september end or October starting. Refer RTPs of past 3\u20134 papers also. All the best :-) Edit : Most importantly leave all social networking sites (even quora) and if possible use simple phone instead of smartphone after june end. You can have a look into this- Priya Jain's answer to How can I get a rank in CA IPCC (Both groups) by 5 months of self study ? Can anyone please tell the subject wise strategy ? Agree with @pranjali bhapkar and i also want to add some more hacks. Avoid excessive use of internet and smartphone.

They are designed to be buoyant to hold your position nice and flat in the water, have very slick surfaces to streamline and repel water, and often have features to help propulsion in your pull and kick. They are very tight fitting, and not very hard wearing. Ordinary wetsuits, used for surfing and so on, are quite hard work to swim in. They\u2019re not so tight fitting as a swim suit and so fill up with water a bit more and make you heavier. They are lined on the outside with material to make them more hard wearing which creates drag, and are often thicker material. Swimming in a winter weight wetsuit is seriously hard work, and slow. They are more comfortable though, and tough. Then there are suits like shortys and ironman suits, which usually have no arms or legs, or a combination thereof. These are somewhere in the middle. Can a dog swim faster than an olympic swimmer? Is there any way I can be a faster swimmer without swimming? How do I swim faster and longer without being tired? Can you get abs faster from swimming than gyming? How much time should it take to swim one mile in freestyle swimming? I am swimming for 6 months in a 50 meters pool now and I am 30 years old.... I\u2019m not sure. I think it would depend on the quality of the suit and your own swimming ability. If you are already a fast swimmer, you would be in diminishing returns from better equipment. Otherwise, if you are absolutely terrible, it might not \u201cfeel\u201d right, so probably you\u2019d be better off without it. I really can\u2019t say from experience. I have now wore one in over 20 years. It\u2019s not. Thin, polyurethane suits increase buoyancy, reduce resistance and can result in up to a ~5% time drop for an elite swimmer. They are now banned in competition. Anything that absorbs water and/or hinders movement is bound to slow a good swimmer down.",

At this age they become fully subject to the law. A lot like the way 18 years old in the U.S. represents the age where people are subject to the adult criminal justice system. Bar and Bat Mitzvah - Wikipedia The lack of reference to an age of accountability likely relates to 2 things. No one under Christian & Jewish theology is free of sin.  Everyone is born with the potential to do good and evil and thus is held responsible for it. However, God\u2019s grace can save those that do not truly understand evidenced by David not fearing for his son after his passing in 2 Samuel 12 and Jesus asking for his captors to be spared in Luke 23. Bible Gateway passage: 2 Samuel 12:21-23 - New International Version Luke 23:34 Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\" And they divided up his clothes by casting lots. Under Christian theology, Jesus\u2019 salvation succeeds judgement.  1st John 2 explains that Jesus\u2019s sacrifice is not just sufficient for the church, but the whole world. People that live like Jesus will be pardoned, though there is debate as to if they actually have to know of Jesus. Bible Gateway passage: 1 John 2 - New International Version There\u2019s a lot of deeper and differing theologies here, but I hope this sheds some light on your question regarding accountability according to the Bible. To recap, there\u2019s no direct references because we are all accountable, but can be saved by God\u2019s grace. This post helped me answer the question. Feel free to explore it for yourself. Where do I find the age of accountability in the Bible? If you die and go straight to hell, what would you say to Satan? According to the Bible, the earth is only 6000 years old.

If the discrimination is based on caste, then reservation should be based on caste. If the discrimination in based on gender, then reservation should be based on gender. Caste discrimination caused segregation (untouchability). Segregation caused illiteracy (loss of access to schools). Illiteracy caused ignorance (loss of employable skills). Ignorance caused poverty. Poverty is simply a sign of under-lying discrimination - gender and caste. In the absence of discrimination, economic initiatives (scholarships, infrastructure) alone would be sufficient to overcome the problem. India\u2019s poverty is caused by caste discrimination. Here is a list of these discrimination. No Dalits, Muslims please: Study shows rampant discrimination against tenants in NCR  - Segregation Research Details Caste Discrimination in Indian Private Sector  - Hiring discrimination Just 5% of Indian marriages are inter-caste: survey  - untouchability Caste discrimination in India's elite institutions  - discrimination in colleges India: Marginalized Children Denied Education  - discrimination in schools \u201cDalit students forced to clean toilets\u201d  - discrimination in schools Caste Matrimonials,Matrimonial by caste,caste Matrimonials directory 5 honour killings that happened in the last 4 months  - honor-less killings House for sale - only strict vegetarians need apply  - segregation How a Brahmin-Only Township Was Allowed in 21st Century Karnataka  - segregation The case of Tamil Nadu's temple priests  - untouchability None of this discrimination stops because of improvement in economic condition. It changes because the power to discriminate changes hands. That means that SC/ST/OBC control 69% of opportunities irrespective of what economic, social, educational and political power the privileged castes have. Notes: [1]  Will the general category be at loss if SC/ST/OBC decide how their rightful share of opportunities are distributed among themselves?  No, it does not materially affect the number of seats they get in government colleges and jobs. Why are they talking about this? They don\u2019t protest when Una Dalits were beaten up, Dalits are naked paraded, raped and murdered? Is it because they want to divide-n-rule the Dalits into rich/poor Dalit? Could it be that they want to use \u2018leader used reservation\u2019 to blame and stop empowered Dalits from becoming leaders rising to positions of political power like Tina Dabi or Dr. Ambedkar. [2]  Would the general category who get 60% of seats in government offices (as per DoPT reports), allow  additional  25% reservations for the EBC over and above current reservations?

        "a": "Are you a tobacco chewer as well as a smoker? From what I\u2019m told, leukoplakia is caused by chewing tobacco or smoking during meals. There's an anti depressant called Luvox that makes you hate tobacco in all its forms. I'd try that, providing it doesn\u2019t conflict with the lycopene. Leukoplakia makes you very susceptible to mouth cancer. I'm not sure what the odds are, but it doesn't make a difference. Your doctor told you it was dangerous so it's not really worth it to calculate the odds. You have to look after yourself. If it helps, how I remained a non smoker after the Luvox wore off was to move all my furniture around to make my house different. Disrupting your habits is hugely effective in preventing a relapse. You can buy chewable jewellery now, too. My daughter has a chewable necklace that helps with an anxiety condition she has. I wish you luck.

One of my very good friends got diagnosed with breast cancer. She lives in the US. What are some ways that I can help her feel better? I\u2019m 36 and have been diagnosed with a bone lesion on my forehead. How likely is it to be cancer? Yes, of course cutting down on cigarettes would help with healing? Don\u2019t tell me your doctor hasn\u2019t already told you that! Smoking is one of the biggest risk factors for contracting leukoplakia (a firmly attached white, grey or red patch in a mucosal membrane - usually in the mouth). Leukoplakia is a precancerous condition and if you don\u2019t do something about, such as quitting smoking altogether and/or surgery, the odds of getting cancer are high. You do not want cancer in your mouth and having to have your cheek, your lips or your tongue removed. I\u2019ve seen people who\u2019ve had these cut out. It\u2019s not a fun way to be. I strongly recommend you take your doctor\u2019s advice and quit smoking - totally. It could be a lifesaving decision. Don\u2019t screw around with it. From what I know, smoking exacerbates leukoplakia and serious cases increase the risk of getting oral cancer, so cutting down on smoking should help you to recover. Of course, stopping completely would be even better. If you\u2019re addicted to the nicotine, you should ask your doctor if it\u2019s okay to substitute nicotine gum or patches. If the doctor prescribed lycopene, chances are your diet is low in antioxidants, such as found in fruit and vegetables, so healthier eating habits or the addition of supplements may help your condition too. I take antioxidants as a prophylaxis anyway. N.B. Nothing in this answer should be construed as medical diagnosis or medical advice, which I am not qualified to offer.",

        "a": "Affiliate marketing is one of the most popular ways of making money online. It is about a relationship between three main parties: the affiliate (publisher), the merchant (advertiser), and the customer. Affiliates act as extended sales and marketing departments of the merchants and help the customers choose products. Affiliate marketing can provide you with a steady flow of income. What you can earn depends on how successful you are in converting your audience into buyers and service subscribers. It is cost effective and you can work from any place in the world. Sounds easy, doesn\u2019t it? Although affiliate marketing doesn\u2019t require a fortune and years of experience to get started, you shouldn\u2019t expect great results overnight. It is very competitive and you need to spend some time choosing products, making sure that they meet market needs, learn how to promote them and how to measure the success. What is affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing. When you sign up for a partner program, you are assigned a link with a unique ID that makes it possible to track all traffic you send to the advertiser\u2019s site. If your visitor clicks on it and performs the qualified action, you will receive a commission. The qualified action depends on the compensation model. The most commonly used one is pay per sale model which is based on the revenue sharing when a merchant pays an affiliate the percentage of the sale. How to become an affiliate marketer Even though becoming an affiliate marketer can seem like a lot of work, you can make your life a bit easier by organizing your work a bit. By following these steps, you will be able get your own affiliate marketing off the ground in no time. In my Free Training \u201c30 Days to Affiliate Business Success\u201d I go into way more detail about how I started earning a living from affiliate marketing with my strategy. If you are interested in making a living from your own online business I highly recommend checking it out. 1. Find your niche In order to succeed you need to start with three basic steps: Find your proper audience, analyze the problem your audience is facing, solve their problems and help them achieve their goals. If you are not sure what products and solutions your audience would benefit from, you should do proper research. Start with forums and websites popular in your specific industry. What are the most common questions and the most popular products? 2. Become an Expert in your niche When you write products reviews you should know more about them, than your average site visitors. Make sure you provide an honest description and accurate information. If a merchant offers a free trial, make sure to sign up and test it. You can start with the products you use and know well and share your own experience. If you decide to build a website from scratch with the purpose of affiliate marketing and the topic is completely new to you, you will have to spend a lot of time doing proper research. It can bring great results, but before you dive in, first make sure you are enthusiastic about the chosen topic. 3. Find affiliate programs to promote Once you have a category of products selected, you need to choose affiliate programs. You can either sign up for affiliate networks or choose independent programs run by the merchants. Don\u2019t choose advertisers based solely on the highest commission. There are a couple of important factors: Does the merchant have a  good reputation  and sell quality products? You wouldn\u2019t like to promote a brand that generates bad word of mouth. Don\u2019t forget that you are putting your reputation on the line too when promoting a product to your customers. Would you buy it yourself or recommend it to your family? If you don\u2019t trust the company, don\u2019t promote it. If you don\u2019t know the product well, check review websites and read testimonials from other users. Does the merchant look  reliable ? You don\u2019t want to promote the business that probably won\u2019t be on the market in a couple of months. Think about the  payout . Do you prefer high one-time commission or do you prefer making money on each payment your customers make? When you promote SaaS products, a  lifetime recurring commission may seem to be much more attractive in a long term. Do similar brands offer similar percentage? As mentioned before, don\u2019t fall for a very high commission and get\u2013rich\u2013quick promise. What\u2019s the  performance model  that works best for you? If there is not a lot of traffic on your website, don\u2019t expect to make a fortune in a pay per click model. However, if you have even a small group of loyal readers, there is a chance that they will buy a product you recommend (pay-per-sale should be your choice then). Is this program  free to join  and do you have to be a customer? How the  lifetime cookie  works? Will your visitors be assigned to your affiliate account if they return to the merchant site after several months? Check the  terms and conditions  for clauses in the agreement that you find unacceptable eg. whether trademark bidding on search engines is allowed. How about  reports ? Will you be able to easily track your results? 4. Start promoting There are many traffic sources and you can try them out simultaneously to increase your chances of making money: Banners: linking images and banners to the merchant\u2019s website is the least you can do to get started. Focus on quality, not quantity. One well-placed banner is worth a thousand spread across the whole website. Social Media: testimonials on Twitter and Facebook can bring great results, but you can also try other channels. Pinterest disappointed many users by removing the affiliate links in Feb 2015 to bring them back over a year later. Now you can share photos of your recommended products (relevant to your boards!) and include affiliate links. Newsletters: collect emails from your website visitors and let them know when you publish a new post. Reviews: share your personal opinion about a product. Why do you find it useful? How did it improve your KPIs? Visitors read reviews to learn something new and find out what experience other people had with a product or service. Comparison posts\u2013 who\u2019s offering the best deal? What\u2019s the difference between product A and product B? Tutorials: step\u2013by\u2013step instructions and tips on how to make the most of the product. Resource page: recommend solutions that you use on your website. Ebook: if you consider yourself a writer and have interesting statistics or stories you\u2019d like to share, publish an ebook. You can include your affiliate links in text or images. Anything else you can think of: be creative and come up with new ideas. A comparison post doesn\u2019t have to include a table. For example, you can come up with a quiz for your audience and show the products that match their answers. Remember: Products you promote and the content you create should match. Your audience comes to your website or signs up to your newsletters to read valuable articles. Focus on your readers, the problems they may face, and how to solve them. If your content is of real value and doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s been created for the sole purpose of promotion, people will more likely click on links. 5. Monitor your results In affiliate marketing it is important to test various promotional strategies and track your online marketing efforts. If the merchant provides reports based on UTM codes, don\u2019t forget to tag your campaigns. It will help you understand what kind of campaigns work with your audience. Affiliate marketing done right Affiliate marketing is not as easy as it seems, but when it\u2019s done right, it\u2019s worth the effort. Foster relationships, learn every day to become an expert in your niche, and focus on creative ways to promote affiliate programs.

It\u2019s a good metric, look: Jordan (6) Magic, Shaq, Lebron, Duncan (3) Willis Reed, Kareem, Larry Bird, Hakeem, Olajuwon. If you swap out Willis Reed for Bill Russell (the award is named after him), you probably have a solid list of the top ten players of all time. Other stats that are useful would be the number of All-NBA 1st teams, MVPs, and championships. Who is the best NBA basketball player of all time? Why is Kwame Brown the greatest NBA player of all time? He's so potent offensively and defensively that it's insane. Who is the worst NBA basketball player of all time? What do NBA players do in their free time? Who are the top 10 NBA basketball players of all time who are now broke? This is a good question, Here are the  quantitative stats  I consider. In no particular order of importance. 1. No. of MVPs. * 2. No. of titles. * 3. No. of finals MVPs. * 4. No. of first team all NBA selections. * 5. No. of first and 3nd team all defense selections. * 6. No. of defensive player of the year selections. * 7. No. of scoring titles. * 8. No. of rebounding and assists titles. * 9. Total points and average ppg. * 10. Average rebounds/game. 11. Average assists/game. 12. Number of win shares. 13. FG%. 14. Playoff total points and average ppg. Here are  qualitative criteria  I consider. 1. Dominance. * 2. Leadership. * 3. Impact on the league (attendance, rules changes, publicity) 4. Skills. * I tend to refer to these in presenting arguments for a player to be the GOAT. There are a couple things that I think of when judging if a player is the best player of all time Good offensively and defensively Good at passing Can shoot from almost anywhere on the court Good with other teammates Good at getting boards(offensively and defensively) Smart and intelligence Can get steals and blocks Not many turnovers Fast Aggressive All-around player Championships Team wins Personal stats",

        "a": "If the woman was of diplomatic importance she would be well treated and negotiations on a national level would be opened, as often for political advantage as for profit. If the woman was worth ransoming, the ransom would be demanded of her family. Her treatment in captivity depended on how ruthless her captors were and how soon the ransom was paid. If the woman was not worth ransoming but could work or be prostituted, she was made economic use of by her captors. If not fit for such work the woman was dependent on the mercy of her captors. There was naked greed in many medieval military actions. For example:  Free company - Wikipedia In Medieval times, what happened if a footman captured a knight or noble? What happened to women during World War I? What would happen in medieval times if a noble's ONLY child was born out of wedlock? Were women forbidden to go to war during the medieval times? How obedient were women in medieval times to their husband? Depending on the time, the person and place in this time period you could get anything from enslavement, ransom or freeing shortly after being captured. Most of the time, the women stayed with their families and were not captured. If high-born, noble ladies might be held for ransom or married by a conqueror. Wars were fought with modest numbers of troops, and the armies sometimes did not harm the peasants. If in a citadel that held out, they might be raped. Most were peasants who may not have cared who their overlord was. Women were not typically captured as combatants were. If a city was taken by force, rape and occasional murder were typical. Some societies took slaves, others left them alone after the rapes, and yet others took captured women as trophy wives. This all assumes that slaughter is not the enemy armies goal, but at that point, things are looking pretty bleak for everyone.",

        "a": "I think I have the perfect answer to your question. For me, Lionel Messi is the greatest ever football player. And it is not simply determined by the trophies he is going to win in the next few years. But, Lionel Messi is often criticised for not winning any international trophies and it is often those critics who fail to call him the greatest ever. Lionel Messi winning a world cup would simply silence those harsh people and yeah, he might be tagged as G. O. A. T. (Greatest of all time) by those people. But, obviously, their opinions don't really matter as they too are humans. Just enjoy the beautiful game. (Anyway, I'm hoping that Argentina qualifies and wins the 2018 FIFA world cup just for the sake of Messi. He completely deserves it.) Will Messi be considered the greatest player ever if he manages to help his team clinch the World Cup? Which team will win the 2018 World Cup? What was the meaning behind Lionel Messi's celebration for the winning goal in Sunday's Cl\u00e1sico? Is Messi the best of all time? If not, where does he rank among the all-time greats? Is it bad for Germany to win the World Cup? Both Ronaldo and Messi are likely to participate in the next world cup, that is scheduled in Russia in 2018. Assuming it will be their last World Cup, there are three scenarios that we need to look at here: i) Messi wins, Ronaldo doesn\u2019t. Both Messi and Ronaldo have enjoyed immense success at the club level. But Ronaldo has won the Euro Cup too which gives him a slight advantage over Messi. However, Messi winning the World Cup, will tilt things in the Argentine\u2019s favour yet again. ii) Ronaldo wins, Messi doesn\u2019t. If Ronaldo manages to win the World Cup with Portugal, he would be adding another major title with his country and that will steer him clear of Messi and push him straight to the top. Like him or not, one simply cannot discount chances of this happening. iii) Neither Messi nor Ronaldo wins. If neither of them is able to win it, opinion will still be divided as to who is the better player of the two. Things still tilt slightly in Ronaldo\u2019s favour because of his Euro title, but neither of them would be the greatest ever. That for me, is still between Pele and Maradona. With worldcup or w/o worldcup, Messi is greatest ever.. let him finish his career. And this opinion is not of fanboys this opinion is shared by people who are already legends in Football and have seen play Pele, Maradona and Messi. Entering names of pele and mara because they're considered to be all time greats Without World Cup he is considered as greatest even with pele and Maradona ! And A World Cup doesn't make someone greater than someone who don't have ! A world cup of Spain doesn't make Sergio Ramos or pique better than Maldini ! A World Cup is team trophy so if messi wins it means whole Argentina squad win it ! So that doesn't mean stricker Higuain or Sergio Aguero is better than Suarez or Ronaldo! Write the caption from man who is only capable of praising him with words! He is already greatest ever! It really depends on how you decide how a player is the greatest is it due to his skill or his trophy cabinet? I would argue that Messi faces tough competition as the greatest all time player from two other World Cup winners Pele(1958,1962 and 1970) and Maradonna(1986, RU 1990).",

Delegate duties to individuals and make sure the individual understands the responsibility involved with the task; make sure he/she understands that the accountability of that task rests solely on his/her shoulders. Use Technology . Make sure to use online project management and task management tool like  ProofHub  to manage projects, employees & clients. With the help of this tool, your projects, teams, clients and all the communication stays in one place without the need of investing in too many different tools to run your business. This makes it easy to create plans, collaborate with teams and clients, keep things organized and deliver projects on time. Encourage, reward, motivate and recognize all jobs well done . Nothing inspires an employee more than a big thank you hug from the boss; it makes an employee feel important and that employee will strive to repeat the feat that earned him/her the hug. Create a family like atmosphere.  Make sure your employees know that regardless of how you feel about them that you always have their backs and are willing to go to war for them. Train, train, and retrain.  An employee is more likely to be productive when they understand what exactly is expected from them and they are given the training to perform such a task. Training gives confidence and confidence leads to employees that are productive. Celebrate victories no matter how small.  When an employee sees that every positive contribution to the team is acknowledged, he or she knows that their actions count and that what they do is really making a difference. Set realistic and achievable targets for the workers . Setting goals or targets for your employees improves their productivity, effectiveness and efficiency but make sure the goals are attainable. Encourage team work for better results . Don\u2019t allow your employees to work in isolation all the time. You must teach your employees the importance of inspiring each other even in your absence.

There are many ways to improve productivity. The best and most effective way I've found is to simply ask the employees.

The more included they feel, the more comfortable they will be giving feedback Make sure it's a safe environment. Have regular safety discussions and make sure employees have \u201cgo to \u201c people if they feel something or someone is unsafe. Postings help Make sure employees are properly trained and that managers are actively involved with their team Manager's need to be trained to identify employee engagement and lack thereof. They need to know how to motivate their team. Employees that feel valued are the most productive. Different age demographics can alter what the best way is to engage them.

Their army will now blame Nawaz Sharif for not defending the case properly; and hence I expect the differences between the two to widen. Perhaps good for India. 2. Most likely their army won't have the audacity to 'kill' Mr Jadhav, as Indian Govt has warned they will go to any extent to save him. So, killing now, after the court verdict, will be suicidal for them; as it will give legitimacy to any retaliatory major strike by India. 3. India should now take the matter to UNSC, as that alone has the power to get the ICJ verdict implemented. 4. India is not a member of UNSC. While other 4 members may support India, China will be forced to use its Veto power to save its 'friend' whom it wants to colonise ultimately.... God knows when. But the problem is by doing so China will get exposed globally and face embarrassment, which it may not like for no immediate gains. Hence, China may compel Pakistani to kill Jadhav, showing it a 'death' due to sickness, etc, the moment it learns India is approaching the Security Council. 5. So, Pakistan in a catch-22 situation, a big bone in its threat which it can neither swallow nor throw up. They should have thought 100 times before taking 'punga' with India. Don't know how long will they take to understand that India since 2014 is no more a Soft State it used to be. Unprecedented bold decision of India to take the issue to ICJ has proved counterproductive for them. Any debates about Jadhav will only draw international attention to internal problems in Balochistan; which India will surely exploit. 6. Well, Pakistani army may be haughty, and stupid, not finding a way how to deal with the new India; but why our opposition is acting foolish? When will they realise that their antics of taking pro-Paki line is also going to boomerang? I'm saying so bcs today Manish Tiwari, Congress spokesman, was taking pro-Pakistani line over NDTV. What is your view on Mr. Kulbhushan Jadhav's case at International court of justice? Who's lying and who's legit? What is your view/opinion about International Court of Justice (ICJ) hearing on Kulbhushan Jadhav's case? What is your view on ICJ's verdict on former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav? Is it a major setback for Pakistan in the global arena? Why did Pakistan feel angry when India went to the ICJ regarding Kulbhushan Jadhav when they themselves go to the UN every now and then for Ka... What could India do apart from going to ICJ to stop Pakistan from executing Kulbhushan Jadhav secretly? ICJ had not given any verdict in the case. They have only stayed the hanging till final verdict. I am not sure if Pakistan will adhere to it if verdict goes on favour of India. They may kill him in some other way like poisoning etc. They may simply refuse to accept verdict. I can see only 1% chance of his return to India & that also when i am being highly optimistic Keep your fingers cross. Who knows, India may get hold of some more of their senior guys& get some exchange done If India is able to save him, it will be a historical victory for India. He was a senior guy & his safety means alot to India The ICJ\u2019s 11 judge bench has ordered Pakistan not to execute innocent Indian citizen Kulbhudhan Jadhav till the court gives its final decision. The court also directed Pakistan to take all measures at its disposal to ensure that Mr Jadhav is safe till final virdict. The court struck down Pakistan\u2019s contention that the ICJ had no jurisdiction to hear the Indian petition. Hours later Pakistan informed Court the execution was not imminent till August.",

        "a": "Q:  Is it illegal to read and drive? A:  Yes, it is illegal to read and drive. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a Kindle, or a newspaper, or a novel, or even a map. Too many times I have seen a driver on the road with a newspaper slapped up on the steering wheel, or a driver looking down in their lap. Usually this occurs in bad traffic stop and start conditions, but that doesn\u2019t make it safe in any way. While in many/most locations it is not illegal to have a GPS application running, either on a smart phone or a dedicated GPS receiver, as long as the unit is statically mounted in such a way as to not require the user\u2019s hands, nor to impede in their visibility of the road. Even in Maryland a driver may have a hands-free phone call. However, many researchers feel that is just as distracting as holding a phone in your hand. So this may go away someday. I am a Waze user and often drive down through Maryland, and have not run into any such issues. Maryland state police are very thorough about monitoring traffic. Is it legal to read a book while driving? If you build a car, is it illegal to drive it on U.S. streets? Is it legal to read a newspaper while driving a Tesla with Autopilot on? Is it illegal to splash someone on the sidewalk while driving down the road? Is it illegal to drive with a picture of your license? It is illegal to do anything which distracts you from driving. Therefore yes, it is illegal to read and drive. No, your Kindle is not ok to use. Think about it. How could it possibly be safe for you to read a book on your Kindle and drive at the same time. If you require legal assistance, please contact a lawyer in yo... Repeat after me: The only thing you should be doing while driving is  driving. Legal, illeagal,  you\u2019re not paying attention. That is how people get killed. Yes, it is illegal to read and drive. In California there is what is known as the \"basic speed law,\" which essentially states that it is illegal to operate a vehicle at a speed that is unsafe for the prevailing conditions. If the prevailing condition is that you, the driver, are reading, then it could be reasonably argued that the safe speed is zero mph. My understanding is that most states have a similar statute. Every US state and most international jurisdictions have general laws against distracted driving. In California, I\u2019ve also seen tickets upheld for violating the basic California speed law. This law states that it is illegal to be driving faster than conditions permit. Several courts have ruled that the maximum safe speed for driving while reading is 0 mph. Reading inherently requires you to focus on the text and follow along with it. Switching focus between the text and other activities impairs both reading comprehension and outside perception. Failing to perceive your environment while driving is very dangerous. What\u2019s more, reading adds a cognitive burden. Your brain is processing the words and ideas and is less able to react to outside events. This increases the danger. finally, holding the kindle and pressing or swiping to change pages means that one or both hands are not controlling the wheel. This augments the danger yet again. I strongly suggest switching to audiobooks or saving your reading until the car is safely parked.",

        "a": "The rest of the answers, particularly Quora User\u2019, offer reasons why government regulation and licensure create and sustain monopolies. I absolutely agree with that assessment. GW Nutter\u2019s \u201cEnterprise Monopoly in the United States\u201d (1969) offers the empirical support that this is absolutely the case: government action accelerates monopoly formation and extends their duration. I\u2019m going to add to the conversation by looking at how monopolies can form within a free market without government interference, what conditions would be necessary for it to endure, and whether or not that would be a good thing. Monopoly production simply means that there is one producer of a good. To this extent, I\u2019m the only producer of Austin Middleton labor: am I therefore a monopolist? Technically, yes. But neither do I possess any of the characteristics usually associated with monopolies, which is the reduction of quantity supplied in order to increase unit price, and the prevention of others from supplying a close substitute good. To the extent that a monopoly - like my Middleton monopoly - cannot exert monopolistic pricing power to maximize producer\u2019s surplus, monopolies neither harm nor disrupt free markets. To the extent that a product has close substitutes - my labor and some other shiftless econ grad student\u2019s; Coke and Pepsi; Oban and Laphroaig - the monopolist\u2019s product can be substituted away from if they attempt to exert monopolistic pricing power. ( I should point out that the availability of substitutes is a big factor in a product\u2019s price elasticity of demand, so we\u2019re probably looking for a product with relatively inelastic demand. Also keep in mind that  doing without  is a substitute for  any  product. Maybe not a  desirable  substitute, but a substitute nonetheless. ) Time and entrepreneurship matter for substitutes: when people see Snuggies are selling like hotcakes, other firms will start sewing sleeves on blankets. To maintain the condition of no good substitutes you need either government protection ( which we\u2019ve assumed away ), sufficiently mysterious proprietary production process ( which, since reverse engineering is a thing, is damned hard ), or continual innovative improvement faster than competitive reverse engineering can keep up with ( which is also damned hard, if  less  damnably hard ). There\u2019s another reason to look for inelsatic demand: the more inelastic the demand, the less production the monopolist has to cut in order to obtain monopoly profits. Or alternatively, the more inelastic the demand, the more monopoly profit will be obtained from any reduction in production. See below. ( Monopoly profits for the inelastic demand curve is the rectangle P*CAPg, larger than the monopoly profits gained with elastic demand, described by the rectangle P*CBPb ) 3. My labor, if I were the most unique, special, indispensable, inimitable econ grad student ever, might be remunerated at a higher price, but under no circumstances would I disrupt the economy. \u201cThe economy\u201d, that is, the metaphor for the collective production, consumption, and coordinating decisions made by the network of humanity, is ever so much larger than my labor\u2019s contribution. Shifting cargo can cause trouble for ships, but a flea hopping from port to starboard won\u2019t.  Magnitudes matter . In order for a monopoly to properly disrupt the economy, it would have to be \u201csufficiently large\u201d to influence others\u2019 decisions. ( And no: I\u2019m not going to define sufficiently large with a % of market share; I\u2019m simply going to posit that such a threshold exists. ) So what we\u2019re looking for in a free-market monopoly is a sufficiently unique product, that supplies a sufficiently large demand in the market, that has relatively inelastic market demand, that exerts monopoly pricing power by reducing quantity supplied. There\u2019s a degree of tension between the second and third qualities there: the more of an individual\u2019s total expenditure a product represents, the more elastic demand becomes for the individual. To get a large inelastic market demand, you\u2019re going to want a product that represents a small % of individuals\u2019 budgets, but is included in  everyone\u2019s  budgetary expenditure. What sorts of production processes will contribute to our free-market monopoly\u2019s ability to exert monopolistic pricing power? What cost structure? Here we\u2019re looking at the so-called \u201cnatural monopolies\u201d. They possess a decreasing long-run average cost curve, which means that for each additional unit produced, the average cost of each unit falls. Often this is because total costs are dominated by fixed costs of production  vice  marginal costs. Such a cost structure tends to concentrate production because for any quantity of product demanded, a single firm will be able to produce it for lower costs than multiple firms. ( From my Micro slides ) In this industry with decreasing average unit costs, two firms producing 50 units each will have a total production cost of 500, while a single firm producing 100 units will have a total production cost of 250. And that\u2019s while the market price of the product stays the same: that 250 is pure profit. Both firms X and Y will be incented to increase production. That, of course, will mean the market is flooded with competing products. Since we\u2019re looking for a product with relatively inelastic demand ( see above ), increasing production will result in a precipitous fall in market price: one of the two firms will be driven out of the market, and the remaining firm will be able to produce 100 units with a lower average cost than before. Of course, this example starts from the position of multiple firms competing in a decreasing long-run average cost production industry. Our free market monopolist will start from the position of Qx=100, and such a position will make it difficult for competing firms to enter, since they\u2019ll (likely) begin producing at a higher average cost, and will be less able to weather the drop in market prices due to inelastic market demand. This hypothetical free-market monopoly product has high fixed costs but is easily replicable  (read:  relatively low constant or decreasing marginal costs of production );  appeals to everyone  ( is in everyone\u2019s consumption set, making monopoly production economically significant );  is affordable to everyone  ( represents a low % of individuals\u2019 total expenditure, producing inelastic demand );  and has no good substitutes . The further our product deviates from these conditions, the smaller the magnitude of impact the product will have; the smaller the monopoly profits the firm will capture; and therefore the less disruption on the economy as a whole. The product I\u2019ve just described is the best product in the history of ever. Disrupt the economy? Yes, absolutely: by making everyone fantastically better off. This is particularly true if in order to maintain their non-substitutable condition the monopolist must continually improve and innovate the product. Far from being something something to be feared and avoided, this is the kind of product development that should be sought and desired. By  everyone. What are some examples of a monopoly market? Did Hayek account for the negative impact on economy/citizens when a monopoly is formed in the free market? What was his idea of such regulati... How does a free market deal with harmful goods? Can markets be too free? Which industry looks like a free market but is actually a Monopoly? I always wonder at the think patterns of people asking questions like this and the common answers we see. I get the impression the goal and discussions are almost without exception vague and theoretically based.  Let\u2019s look at things from a practical perspective. Originally monopolies came about when something totally new that cannot be copied easily was invented. In practice every single item you buy was the product of a monopoly at some time in the past. It became a popular product because a sufficient number of people evaluated that item. They determined the \u201cvalue\u201d for themselves against the \u201ccost\u201d of making one for themselves. I they saw more value in buying the product rather than making it for themselves they became - consumers. Needless to say the if the value gap between value to the consumer and the assessed cost of providing it for himself is large enough the originator will make profits. If this originator actively pursues the  Experience Curve  effect. His cost will decline as he and his organization learns how to become more productive and his profitability will escalate. The originator is then faced with a quandary; Do I keep prices the same and simply bank the extra profit? OR Do I reduce prices to bring more consumers into my market? Increasing total market size and generating a larger total profit? The moment this new product\u2019s profitability becomes known. Many Copiers will try to emulate the innovator. My first personal computer (Apple 11 & DOS 1.1) cost about 6 month\u2019s pay. Then along came a Taiwanese copier and soon I was able to buy a similar one for my Secretary at about 25% of my original price. Today a similar computer costs less than a week\u2019s pay. If you explore  Patent  you will find that originally it was a Top Down Government decree that granted permanent exclusivity to people or organizations the Monarch could rely on to feed money via taxes into the wealth reserves of the Monarchy. Over time patents got expiry dates. This only allowed the initiator a limited time within which he could profit from his innovation. In Short; Enforced Monopolies can be good as they reward innovation. However they can also be bad as they erect barriers to entry. However, In any Market the Consumer is KING. If he considers the product of a monopoly to be too expensive he can decide not to buy and make do without it or to make it for himself. If sufficient consumers refuse to pay the excessive price of a monopolistic market exploiter - his business will die. Monopolies  are a symptom of state interference in a market. Without state interference, global/national monopolies would not exist as long as they do currently. Whether or not that is a bad thing, depends on your values and ideals. I personally think state interference (and monopolies) are a bad thing, because: Market Distortions  caused by state action usually benefit those whom seek power over others. These hierarchies cause secondary and tertiary social problems. When the rules apply unevenly to those involved (which is always the case with state action) it induces financial instability. Monopolies represent the scenario where producer surplus is maximized at the cost of consumer surplus. In  Free Markets  the relationship between consumers and producers are more even and balanced. The maintenance of monopolies require theft and/or restrictions on the freedoms of others. This is obviously illiberal, illibertarian, and violates the autonomy and self-ownership of those individuals affected. Monopolies are only a symptom of state interference in the free-market though. They are not the cause. In fantasy land where the government isn't meddling in everything, reasonable realistic capitalism, monopoly are neither good or bad they just kinda happen every now and then. They are the system equivalent of a tornado, chaotic events that are a natural by product of a complex system \u2026 they collapse under their own weight and disappear chance are creating an over supply of capital fertilizer for the next round of companies.",

Will Islam eventually die? Literally, the Sun, spiritually, the Son. Gareth's wordplay of the day - check! Years ago I was lead to believe that to practice Nichiren\u2019s Buddhism correctly, one had to attend meetings and belong to an organisation. Nowadays I\u2019ve come to understand that anyone, regardless of whether they become a \u2018member\u2019 of a group or not, can benefit from their own personal practice. The reason for this is that the Law of myoho-renge-kyo represents the identity of what some now refer to as the \u2018unified field of all consciousnesses\u2019. In other words, it\u2019s the essence behind all existence and non-existence, the ultimate creative force behind planets, stars, nebulae, people, animals, trees, fish, birds and all phenomena, manifest or latent. All matter and intelligence is simply waves or ripples manifesting to and from this core source. Consciousness (enlightenment) is itself the true creator of everything that is, ever was and ever will be, right down to the minutest particles of dust, each being an individual ripple or wave. The big difference between chanting \u2018Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2019 Nam = to awaken and align with one's inner-self) and most conventional prayers is that instead of depending on a middle man to connect us to our state of enlightenment, we\u2019re able to do it ourselves by tapping directly into it by way of self-produced sound vibration. On the subject of \u2018what or who is God?\u2019, when we compare the concept of \u2018God\u2019, as a separate entity that is forever watching down on us, to Nichiren\u2019s teachings, the true omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence of what most people call \u2018God\u2019 is our enlightenment, which exists nowhere else but within us. When the disciples asked Jesus where the Kingdom of God is, didn\u2019t he tell them that it was within them? Some say that \u2018God\u2019 is an entity that can never be seen. I think that the vast amount of information that is constantly being conveyed via electromagnetic waves gives us proof of how an invisible state of what many call \u2018God\u2019 could actually exist. It\u2019s widely known that certain data being relayed by way of electromagnetic waves has the potential to help bring about extraordinary and powerful effects, including instant global awareness of something or mass emotional reaction. As well as many other things, it\u2019s also common knowledge that these waves can be used to detonate a bomb or to even enable NASA to control the movements of a robot as far away as the Moon or Mars. However, none of this is possible without a receiver to decode the information that is being transmitted. Without the receiver, the information would remain impotent. In a similar way, it\u2019s very important for us to have our receiver switched on, so that we can activate a clear and precise understanding of our life, all other life and who we and all else that exists truly is. Chanting \u2018Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2019 helps us to achieve this, because it allows us to reach into the core of our enlightenment and switch it on. That\u2019s because, as I mentioned before, the sound vibration of \u2018myoho-renge-kyo\u2019 represents the combination of the three major laws that underlie all existence. \u2018Myoho\u2019 represents the Law of latency and manifestation (Nature), and consists of two alternating states. One state of \u2018myo\u2019 is where everything in life that\u2019s not obvious to us exists. This includes our stored memories when we\u2019re not thinking about them, our hidden potential and inner emotions whenever they\u2019re not being expressed, our desires, our fears, our wisdom, happiness, karma, and more importantly, our enlightenment. The other state, \u2018ho\u2019, is where everything in Life exists whenever it becomes obvious to us, such as when a thought pops up from our memory, whenever we experience or express our emotions, or whenever a good or bad effect comes forth from our karma. When anything becomes apparent, it simply means that it has come out of the state of \u2018myo\u2019 (dormancy/latency) and into a state of \u2018ho\u2019 (manifestation). It\u2019s the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, being awake or asleep, or knowing and not knowing something. The second law, \u2018renge\u2019, governs and controls the functions of \u2018myoho\u2019 \u2013 \u2018ren\u2019 meaning cause and \u2018ge\u2019 meaning effect. These two laws, \u2018myoho\u2019 and \u2018renge\u2019, work together simultaneously and underlie all spiritual and physical existence. The final and third part of the tri-combination, \u2018kyo\u2019, is what allows the law \u2018myoho\u2019 to integrate with the law \u2018renge\u2019. It\u2019s the great, invisible thread of energy that fuses and connects together all Life and matter, as well as the past, present and future. It is often termed the Universal Law of Communication. Perhaps it could even be compared to the \u2018string theory\u2019 that some scientists now suspect exists. Just as our body cells, thoughts, feelings and all else are constantly fluctuating within us, everything in the world around us and beyond is also in a constant state of flux, in accordance with these three laws. In fact, more things are going back and forth between the two states of \u2018myo\u2019 and \u2018ho\u2019 in a single moment than it would ever be possible for us to calculate or describe. And it doesn't matter how big, small, important or trivial anything may appear to be, everything that\u2019s ever existed in the past, exists now, or will exist in the future, exists only because of the workings of 'myoho-renge-kyo'. These three laws are also the basis of the four fundamental forces and if they didn't function, neither we nor anything else could go on existing. Simply put, all forms of existence, including the seasons, day and night, birth, death and so on, are moving forward in an ongoing flow of continuation, rhythmically reverting back and forth between the two states of \u2018myo\u2019 and \u2018ho\u2019 in accordance with \u2018renge\u2019 and by way of \u2018kyo\u2019. Even stars are dying and being reborn again in accordance with the workings of \u2018myoho-renge-kyo\u2019. \u2018Nam\u2019 is like a password or key; it allows us to reach deep within our life and fuse with or become one with \u2018myoho-renge-kyo\u2019. On a more personal basis, nothing ever happens by chance or coincidence, it\u2019s the causes that we\u2019ve made in our past, or are presently making, that determine how these laws function uniquely in each of our lives from moment to moment, as well as our environment. By facing east, in harmony with the direction that the Earth turns and rhythmically chanting \u2018Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2019 repeatedly for a minimum of ten minutes daily, any of us can gain actual proof of its effects in our life. By building up a force from within, it allows us to pierce through even the thickest layers of our karma and reach directly into the ultimate wisdom of our and all other life. Unlike the fantasy of a magic wand to make our problems vanish, chanting \u2018Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2019 awakens our innate wisdom and brings to the surface our hidden potential, a much clearer realisation and understanding of our good and bad karma, and positive ways that we can both cope with and change our negative circumstances into positive ones. It brings forth the wisdom that can free us from the ignorance and stupidity that is preventing us from accepting and being proud of who we truly are, regardless of our race, colour, gender or sexual preference. It also allows us to see and understand things outside of ourselves more clearly and, by way of the electromagnetic forces of which we are all a part, helps us to connect with, or draw towards us, any external circumstances or help that we need. Proof of this effect soon becomes obvious to anyone who chants \u2018Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2019 on a regular basis. Of course, the more sincerely we chant, the more powerful and faster its effect will be.\ufeff At risk of sounding like the dirty hippy I am, you are.

        "a": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: \u201cExciter may refer to: The low-power RF stages of a radio transmitter. A radio transmitter is usually part of a radio communication system which uses electromagnetic waves (radio waves) to transport information (in this case sound) over a distance. In electronics and telecommunications a transmitter or radio transmitter is an electronic device which generates a radio frequency alternating current. When a connected antenna is excited by this alternating current, the antenna emits radio waves. In addition to their use in broadcasting, transmitters are necessary component parts of many electronic devices that communicate by radio, such as cell phones, wireless computer networks, Bluetooth enabled devices, garage door openers, two-way radios in aircraft, ships, spacecraft, radar sets and navigational beacons. The term transmitter is usually limited to equipment that generates radio waves for communication purposes; or radiolocation, such as radar and navigational transmitters. Generators of radio waves for heating or industrial purposes, such as microwave ovens or diathermy equipment, are not usually called transmitters even though they often have similar circuits. The term is popularly used more specifically to refer to a broadcast transmitter, a transmitter used in broadcasting, as in FM radio transmitter or television transmitter. This usage typically includes both the transmitter proper, the antenna, and often the building it is housed in.\u201d How are an FM exciter and an FM transmitter different? What are the good corporate AD FM? Who are the RJs of AIR FM Gold? Why is Talksport not on FM radio? How is an FM transmitter used? In simple terms (the ones I know!) the FM exciter is the piece of gear in the broadcast chain that translates audio into a low-power frequency-modulated wave at the correct frequency. This usually 10-watt signal is then amplified many-fold by the intermediate and final stages of the transmitter, sent into a low-loss coaxial cable, up the side of the tower to the antenna. By the nature of the antenna\u2019s radiating elements\u2019 positions in relation to one another, they re-enforce the RF, creating additional \u201cgain\u201d so as to attain the station\u2019s correct authorized ERP (\u201ceffective radiated power\u201d, in the U.S. usually somewhere between 1 and 100 killowatts). The electromagnetic waves literally \u201cbathe\u201d your receiving antenna with signal to be \u201cdecoded\u201d in your receiver. In simpler terms, radio programmers tend to call this FM: F*****G MAGIC\u201d Basically it the first stage of a transmitter; oscillator, modulator, before your amplifier stages.",

Which is more important, doing right or doing good? Ethic\u2019s aren\u2019t objective doesn\u2019t mean that you are permitted to do whatever you want. It means that the terms \u201cgood/ethical\u201d and \u201cbad/unethical\u201d have unsubstantiated assumptions behind them.

But the burden to make a valid argument still exists. Lack of objectivity and \u201cabsurdity\u201d are not the same. So, you cannot make up your own rules as you see fit. Your view on ethics must withstand logical scrutiny. Yes. Does that mean it\u2019s consensual? No. Society usually calls consensual ethics the legal system. In fact in a representative democracy, the consensus of ethical behavior must be represented by the legal system. Do laws change? Yes, case in point, the prohibition of marijuana.

Do all laws reflect ethical values. Yes. Even the regulatory statues. How do you decide what and how to regulate? Laws and regulations are designed to re enforce what society deems ethically correct.

They tend to revolve around do no harm, do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

I don\u2019t know if you will get over it completely but I think you can and should move on. Perhaps at a certain point you will like someone who likes you back. It is possible that he and your friend won\u2019t get together but it\u2019s not something to wish for. It will be unfriendly behavior and even if true you are still at the same place that you were at the beginning - someone you may like but can\u2019t get together with (plus the added awkwardness of him being your friend\u2019s ex). I fell to the trap of keeping feelings for a long time several times. It never ended well. At least in my experience when things work they don\u2019t take that long (but then, the reason I stayed in the trap so long was because for a very long time things didn\u2019t work) Let it be, no good will come from you in the middle now, you should have acted back then instead of making believe you feelings changed.

The reality is that most Americans have no strong feelings either way. It\u2019s also unlikely that you\u2019d be able to find valid statistics on preferences. So the premise of the question is meaningless and therefore cannot be answered. A better way to ask the question would be:\u201dIf you are an American and you prefer Benny Hill to Mr. Bean, can you explain why?\u201d. What are the best questions to ask on a first date? If dogs had Quora, what kind of questions would they ask? You meet God and you can ask him only one yes or no question. What do you ask? What if God would grant you an answer to three questions? What does I thought you'd never ask mean? It\u2019s a phrase stemming from the countless questions on Quora that ask \u201cwhy\u201d followed by an untrue statement. Let\u2019s find a few. Why can\u2019t scientists create artificial water when they know the chemical composition of water\u2014H\u2082O? Why don\u2019t older people drink alcohol? Why is it difficult to make friends in Canada? Why do atheists believe the universe just popped into existence without a creator? Scientists  can  create artificial water. Older people  do  drink alcohol. It  isn\u2019t  difficult to make friends in Canada. Atheists  don\u2019t  believe the universe just popped into existence. The meaning of the phrase \u201cBefore you ask why, ask if\u201d is that you need to find if a particular assertion is true before you ask why that assertion is true. That would be like me asking \u201cWhy does the sun turn on and off?\u201d or \u201cWhy am I dead?\u201d It\u2019s Quora\u2019s response to people making false assumptions about things. There are a lot of \u201cleading questions\u201d asked on Quora, for a number of reasons usually down to personal bias; the question assumes a particular fact is true, then asks why it is true, when in reality the truth of that fact itself is arguable at best and provably false at worst. A Quoran might, for instance, ask \u201cWhy do we still eat bananas when they\u2019re proven to cause homosexuality?\u201d. The purported fact that bananas are proven to cause homosexuality is in fact totally false; there is no such proof. Trying to answer the actual question of \u201cwhy\u201d, then, is totally pointless. Most answers will instead attempt to disillusion the questioner of his mistaken premise. The end result is a question and answers that really help no-one. Okay, so a good example would be: \u201cWhy are all Muslims terrorists?\u201d A good Quora answer to this question would be: \u201cBefore you ask why, ask if. Muslims are not all terrorists\u201d Another example could be: \u201c Why is Donald Trump the greatest person ever in world history \u201d A good Quora answer might be: \u201cBefore you ask why, ask if.

Your expertise with these 4 topics should be such that you don\u2019t get a single question wrong. \u00b7 Polish up your concepts with repeated numerical solving. Nothing helps better in polishing up the concepts than solving numerical. Hammer your mind regularly with more and more numerical problems. This will help increase your conceptual grasp. \u00b7 Keep formulas on your fingertip. Concepts are no good if you don\u2019t remember the formulas. The formulas should be so engraved in your head that even if someone woke you from a slumber you just start reciting the formulas. \u00b7 Solve last 16 years GATE paper by January. We are only afraid of the unknown. When we solve previous year papers we know how the questions can pan out. How can they be twisted? We are mentally prepared for it and hence the nervousness is decreased which helps us perform better. \u00b7 Try and give as many online mock tests as possible to get a feel of the test environment. Tests will help you analyze which areas you need to improve on. Whether it is the conceptual clarity you need to work on or is it silly mistakes that are costing you marks. This will help you calm your nerves and you will feel more relaxed during the actual GATE exam. \u00b7 Analyze the mistakes done in the test and rectify them. Remember \u201c Once is a Mistake, Twice becomes a habit. \u201d Do not give a test and just forget about it. Go home, sit down and analyze how you could have approached a problem in a better way. Once the test results are out, analyze what went wrong and don\u2019t repeat the same mistake again. \u00b7 Do not start studying just a week before GATE. Study regularly and in case of any doubts feel free to reach out to the concerned faculties. GATE is an exam where mind needs to be constantly hammered with concepts and numerical. It is not an exam which you can clear just by starting your preparation a week before. How can I top in gate me without coaching? How do I get the top rank in GATE Exam? Can we crack the GATE with a good rank (CSE) without going to coaching? If yes, then how? Can I get a rank in the top 100 in the GATE (EC branch) while doing M.Tech in NIT? I joined GATE coaching. If I get good rank, what should I do? Since you are just a 2nd year student you have a great deal of time to work and waste\u2026 My 1st advice to you will be to give GATE-2019 in 3rd year\u2026. Just for experience purpose\u2026 even if you aren't prepared\u2026. Those 3 hours and 1500 won't be wasted trust me. 2ndly you are a chemical engineering student so decide are you going to give GATE in chemical engineering or any other papers such as petroleum or material Sciences or any such\u2026. Research that things\u2026. If you want to go for masters than choose a different and demanding field; specialize instead of going for chemical engineering. If u just want to qualify GATE to get into PSUs\u2026 than not an issue. So let me just warn you chemical engineering ppr in GATE is really hard and the cut off is very high. Now\u2026 for the preparation part: Download the previous year pprs and answer keys\u2026they are easily available. And trust me you have 1 1/2 yrs to prepare, give 1 hr each day and you are definitely going to top it\u2026. I won't say that study 3\u20134 hrs daily blah blah blah\u2026. Being a student it's not that easy plus enjoy the clg life\u2026. Do things the smart way not the hard way\u2026 I cleared GATE with AIR 386 with 5 days preparation in engineering sciences. For material I don't think you need big costly boring books\u2026 use YouTube NPTEL videos are the best material available for engineering courses and gate preparation too. You have one and a half year so .. I suggest don't take too much stress but keep an average of one video lecture a day and prepare notes from it. The most important thing\u2026 analyze the papers before you start preparing. See if you can score in General aptitude and Maths section than analyze the rest 70 marks, which subject has more weightege and which topics are important. After that analysis watch lectures on those selected topics/subjects. After you complete the imps\u2026 try to cover other things\u2026 And if you are a little good at English you definitely will score good. You have almost 2 yrs so just take a chill\u2026 GATE isn't impossible\u2026 work smart and you are definitely in top 100. Good luck \\U0001f600 You can get a top rank in GATE withou coaching.Most of the students who crack GATE are generally final year students who crack exam without taking any coaching. Start preparing from second year itself. Note down all the subjects that are asked in the exam. In second year study those subjects that are taught to you in this year. Mke notes. This will help you. The third year is most important. Make sure you finish all the subjects by third year. You must be clear with the basics. In final year start solving questions. Join some test series. Good ones are available. Solve previous year questions. Practice as much questions as possible. You must develop very good speed. Also remember many students get very good rank even by studying from third year itself. It all depends on you skill. It is never late to start. You also don\u2019t need to take stress. Relax and study. All the best. So first of all I would like to convey to you that purchase all core course books and build your concept from now onwards and also practice vast vareity of questions. With this approach You are Bound to come in Top 100 Wish You all the best with your Preparations.",

        "a": "VY Canis Majoris is approximately 1420 R\u2609 (\u00b1 120 R\u2609, but for the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s disregard that). In other words, it has a diameter of 1.9758 \u00d7 10 [math]^{9}[/math]  km. In comparison, Earth has a diameter of 12,742 km. If 1.9758 \u00d7 10 [math]^{9}[/math]  km equals 12,742 km, then 12,742 km is: 12,742 \u00d7 12,742 / 1.9758 \u00d7 10 [math]^{9}[/math]  = 0.08217 km, or 82.17 m. Here is an image I created to compare VY Canis Majoris with Earth, using the Sun as a bridge to compare the two. Of course, the scale of VY Canis Majoris and Earth don\u2019t matter when it comes to a size comparison. Image: Copyright \u00a9 2017 Martin Silvertant. All Rights Reserved. Also, if VY Canis Majoris has a diameter of 12,742 km and Earth has a diameter of 82.17 m, then the Sun has a diameter of 8.97 km. Is vy canis majoris visible from earth? Earth is now the size of UY Scuti. How long does it take to explore this new Earth? Is VY Canis Majoris the second largest star? What would happen if VY Canis Majoris were as dense as our Sun? How big would VY Canis Majoris look if you could appear next to it in person? Radius of VY Canis Majoris:  [math]988.3 \\text{ million km}= 988.3 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km} \\approx 10^9 \\text{ km}[/math] . Radius of Earth:  [math]6,400 \\text{ km}[/math] . It can be inferred that the radius of VY Canis Majoris would have to reduce approximately  [math]80,000[/math]  times in order to be the same size as Earth. So, if Earth\u2019s radius were to reduce  [math]80,000[/math]  times, it would have a radius of  [math]82[/math] [math] \\text{ meters}[/math] . Okay, enough math. Here\u2019s an image to illustrate the size of the Sun and VY Canis Majoris. Image Source: By Oona R\u00e4is\u00e4nen - Self-made in Inkscape., Public Domain,  File:Sun and VY Canis Majoris.svg Here\u2019s an info-graphic\u2014although it is not scaled to a significant accuracy. Horrifying. VY Canis Majoris is estimated to be roughly 1400 times the diameter of the sun. The sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth. This makes VY Canis Majoris\u2019s diameter roughly 150,000 times that of Earth. The Earth\u2019s diameter is 12,750 km, give or take a few. If VY Canis Majoris were shrunk down to the size of Earth and the Earth were shrunk proportionally the Earth would be 12,750 / 150,000 km or 0.085 km across. That\u2019s 85 meters or a bit smaller than a  football field  (or football pitch, if you prefer.) VY Canis Majoris is  huge  but consider however that it is only around 17 times as massive as the sun (give or take a few.) Spread that amount of mass, over a volume of space that is 1400^3 times larger, and you have an average density that is, at most, only around 10 miligrams per cubic meter. That\u2019s about 1/100th the weight of a paperclip- spread out over a cubic meter. The density of Earth\u2019s atmosphere at sea level is around 120,000 times greater. VY Canis Majoris is a monstrously huge, glowing ball of  fluff.",

Mid teens is the most challenging time as we have all these social things tugging our minds in different directions on top of school demands and whatnot. Society is like this illusory demanding monster forcing us to abide by the tides and fit in as much as possible. Not to mention the hormones coursing through our systems at that age. I wouldn't worry about your crush too much, I never had much luck with crushes. Look for someone that likes you, takes the pressure off having to feel the need to impress. So regarding peace of mind and calmness, I practice something called qigong that helps keep my mind clear and free of burdensome things. There are some philosophy and teachings that go along with the practice which teach about some of the deeper aspects of reality and the universe. Once you begin to enlighten to these concepts you'll start to realize how insignificant the majority of these worrisome aspects of society really are. It allows the individual to let go of a lot of things and be comfortable and confident with ourselves. The school of qigong I practice is called Falun Gong which originates out of China where it is banned for political reasons. The discipline is practiced in over a hundred other countries throughout the world and the teachings have been translated into 38 different languages. If interested check out the self titled book \"Falun Gong\" which can be read for free at  falundafa.org . How can I be more relaxed? Why are the people who answer 911 calls so relaxed? How do I relax when its relaxing time? How can I be more relaxed when I'm stressed? How can I stay relaxed? Live minimally within your means, never take anything too seriously, and learn to laugh a lot, at yourself and with others. Most people get into trouble trying to satisfy the needs and ambitions of others; and in personal aggrandizement and acquisitions. Forget all the BS, do whatever you need to survive, and never ever follow anyone or anything. If opportunity comes, recognize it and take advantage of it, but never waste your time, attention, or sleep seeking it out. I was born with nothing and until age 8 lived a life of utter horror, but have since traveled the world and had, done and been almost everything imaginable (rich and poor, good, bad and sinful). I am completely happy or satisfied with 98% of my life. I have made mistakes in my life (but corrected them or balanced them out), and will probably die broke. But I will never, ever have to look back over my shoulder with regret.",

When wearing our short sleeve uniforms, it used to be we couldn't have any tattoos larger than a certain size showing on any portion of exposed skin. These days, full arm sleeves are authorized and as long as you don't have any tattoos on your face or your tattoos don't depict anything offensive in nature, it's all fair game. This change only happened a little less than a year ago. Does a U.S Judge have more power than the U.S constitution? What might happen now that President-elect Donald Trump has won the election?

        "a": "When fuel is injected into combustion chamber, the droplets of fuel takes heat from surrounding air and vaporizes. Then it's temperature goes on increasing till it reaches to auto ignition temperature and then combustion starts. This whole process requires some time (fraction of second) and it is known as IGNITION DELAY OR DELAY PERIOD. Ideally, as  injrction  starts,  ignition  should take place simultaneously. That is , ignition delay should be as small as possible. Suppose auto ignition temperature of fuel is more then there will be more ignition delay period. This means that after injection start, the fuel will droplets will accumulate in combustion chamber. And after auto ignition temperature reaches, this accumulated fuel burns promptly. In fact it explodes. This is cause of knocking in CI Engine. There are several factors which affects knocking such as A/F ratio, compression ratio, auto ignition temperature, engine speed, inlet temperature, intake pressure etc. It is very difficult to differentiate between normal engine running and knocking in case of CI Engine.",

        "a": "Hi there, By the question I am assuming that you have no idea about the categories of software. Lets start from very binning, Initially the computers use to be very complex machines to sun a very specific set of instructions called programs later termed as software. It was OK for a moment but soon demand for running multiple programs with same system spiked giving birth to need of OS or operating system over which multiple programs can run. Now comes the categorization of the software the OS had nothing in direct to do with the users and thus were called as System software and the software running over it were called as application software. Want to know more about software please subscribe to my you tune channel Hope this will help you : https://www.youtube.com/channel/... Thanks and Regards Chandan Kumar chandan177kr@gmail.com What was the first application software? What are the applications of software? What are 10 examples of system software and application software? What is the definition of software applications? What is operating software and application software? Two definitions: In the original and most fundamental use of the term, application software is any software that uses or applies some particular technology. Note that this can and is usually a \u201crelative\u201d term. What\u2019s application software at one level might itself be applied by a higher level piece of software (i.e its application software). For example to the makers of a network interface controller card the application software is the network driver, but to the network driver the application software would be the operating system, to the operating system the application software would be perhaps a browser, to the browser the application would be any web page. It\u2019s all relative and at the lower levels the term application software is still very widely used for other mid and low level pieces of software. More popularly in current usage application software is what might more accurately be called end-user software, that is the \u201chighest\u201d level of software, only because no higher level of software uses it, but rather end-users use it. Particularly with the advent of the smart phone and \u201capps\u201d most people simply perceive of application software as Facebook or Word etc. In my own anecdotal observation very few end-users even know that the word app is just shorthand for application. An application is any  program , or group of programs, that is designed for the  end user . Application  software  can be divided into two general classes:   systems software  and  applications software . Applications software (also called  end-user programs ) include such things as  database  programs,  word processors ,  Web browsers  and  spreadsheets . Figuratively speaking, applications software sits on top of systems software because it is unable to  run  without the operating system and  system  utilities. An application, or app, if you will, is a software designed to solve a specific task for a  user.  The user interacts directly with this software to work on the task at hand, this can be browsing the Web using the Firefox application, or making some calculations using the calculator app for instance. This type of software is what users typically notice when using a computer of some sort, but it is important to note that there are other very important types of software.  System-level software  in a personal computer deals with managing and the correct operation of applications, an example of this is the  operating system. Firmware  is a different type of software, which is loaded onto tiny computers, such as those in microwave ovens, TVs, stereo amplifiers, etc. This software directly controls the hardware is is built in to, to make it behave as expected. This is also often called embedded software.",

If you take a look at the Wikipedia page he\u2019s linked to, reduplication has different uses, one of them being intensification. In at least some cases, that\u2019s its purpose in Hawaiian. For example, the Wiki-Wiki Shuttle at Honolulu International Airport (from whence Wikipedia gets its name!) - \u201cWiki\u201d means \u201cQuick\u201d (this  may  be a transliteration from the English, I\u2019m not sure) and \u201cWiki-Wiki\u201d means \u201c Very  Quick.\u201d (Although the Shuttle doesn\u2019t always live up to its name, so if you\u2019re healthy, not too burdened with luggage, and know where you\u2019re going, it can be faster to just walk between concourses!) I asked a Hawaiian friend whether \u201cKamehameha\u201d contained reduplication, and she explained that it meant  the  (ka)  lonely  (mehameha), but that \u201cmehameha\u201d wasn\u2019t reduplication, and that \u201cThe reduplicaton thing is not as consistent as tourist guidebooks would have one believe.\u201d A couple examples she gave: melemele  is \u201cyellow\u201d but  mele  is most often \u201csong\u201d makemake  is \u201cto desire\u201d or \u201cdefeated,\u201d while  make  is \u201cdead\u201d I should bug her to get on here. How do you say \"let it be\" in Hawaiian? What is the word for sister in hawaiian? How do you say \"good morning\" in Hawaiian? What is the correct pronunciation? What is it like to be a Hawaiian? How would a local Hawaiian say \"come here!\" to another local? Being a dying language, would they say it in Hawaiian? Or is there a pidgin equi... Reduplication is used by various languages for a few different purposes. Sometimes it\u2019s a way of pluralizing a word or concept. Sometimes its a derivational device (for instance, changes a noun into an adjective). Sometimes it\u2019s used for ideophones which are ongoing or repeated. Then there\u2019s echo reduplication, where one or more syllables are repeated exactly or almost exactly, for reasons that linguists don\u2019t fully understand. I suspect that Hawaiian may have more than one of those things going on. As some other answerers mention, it\u2019s also possible that it\u2019s coincidental. There aren\u2019t a lot of consonants and vowels in Hawaiian, which makes for the possibility of having words with many syllables. Some of those syllables will sound the same. It is called  Reduplication - Wikipedia  and is actually pretty common. mahimahi is a fish and kamehameha is football. Im kind of confused as to what you mean..",

        "a": "A2A:  Why whenever Muslim countries in crisis immediately Islamic fundamentalism flourishes? A crisis is usually a situation where the government is unable to function normally or is at a point where they are unable to be relatable to the people or have lost their faith. In such situations, the strongest movements are usually the most violent. It may not be the will of the majority, or may not have support, but manage to make an impact, which peaceful protests don\u2019t usually do. It is either large numbers or power that has an impact. This has been the case with a lot of nations that ended up with communist, fanatical or authoritarian governments and sometimes even otherwise. Iran, Afghanistan, Cuba, Russia, France, Israel all started with revolutions that were violent. Some stayed stable, others failed, but fundamentalist notions or violent revolt does happen in crisis everywhere, not just in Muslim majority nations. The problem with labelling Muslim nations as being hotbeds of fundamentalism is to ignore history and the causation. This is not an attempt to defend fundamentalism, violence or terrorism, it is just my opinion on why it happens. The Middle East which is usually the nations between Egypt and Iran was mostly rural and nomadic. Various factions practiced Islam in different ways and most of the nations were not organised. The Ottoman empire controlled large parts of the land and when their power waned, the Imperialists came in and did what they do best, split the lands on the basis of clans and placed tribal leaders in positions of power. In other regions, such as Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Afghanistan, they undermined the democratic process to install puppet leaders who were supportive of their presence in the region and in their nations, mainly for the purposes of extracting oil. This is the reason that the west still supports Saudi Arabia, although every political observer knows and will tell us implicitly, are the main reason for terror funding in the region and abroad. We willfully buy their oil, making them able to export their brand of virulent and fundamentalist Islam, rather than reform from within, which was what usually happened in most religions over time. This can be seen time and again in other nations too, like Nicaragua, Vietnam, Korea etc, most of these being the result of the Cold War. Now, people are aware that terrorism works and that no one is really equipped to combat it or win. If you respond to violence with violence, innocents will die and their ideals and beliefs will shift to a more aggressive one against the perpetrators. The US public\u2019s stance shifted greatly since 9/11 and the stance of even moderate Muslims in Muslim nations also shifted since the start of the war on terror. No one would take an invasion lightly, no matter what you expect to achieve by doing so. It is easy to convince people that the foreigners are the evil ones and that they are attacking their way of life and their existence. How do you think that nations that have not understood the mindset of people from the region in decades can deal with the aftermath? The Taliban, ISIS, Al Qaida are all the result of the meddling of the West during the cold war and nothing that is being done even today is helping in convincing the common man that it will stop or that it will help, because it does not. The only thing we can hope for is for the leaders of these nations to shift their stance dramatically and be able to be relatable to the people in their nations, and be able to convince them to want change. Else, we will see more conflict and fundamentalism in the near future. Are there any countries where Islam is banned, or that might soon ban Islam? Will India end up having a Muslim majority in the future? What will be the social, economical and political consequences if that happens? If Christians cannot wear a cross in Islamic countries, why should Muslims be allowed to wear a veil in Christian countries? I am fed up of explaining to my Hindu friends that we Muslims too love our country and that Islam doesn't teach us to kill them. Whenever ther... Is the system of divorce in Islam just? Is it a fundamental part of Islam? Does Allah really care about Muslim women? It is a \u201cgood\u201d strategy a Western plan for the Muslim nations in particular and other developing nations in general unfortunately for the people of the region affected buy crisis it has become a part to the interest of the West, That means defeating strategic enemies of the region, particularly Libya and destabilizing Syria and Iraq and then going on to divide and destroy whole regions. Because the rationale is basically if the US and Britain cannot have total monopolization of the wealth and control and monopoly of power in these regions they are not going to allow other dominant world powers to have it Iran and U.S.A are strange bedfellows getting together there to fight against ISIS. It is the same alliance of forces, a raid against the people of the region that we saw since WWII, when London and Washington were particularly allied with the Gulf monarchies in supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and other much more violent sectarian forces in the region against those countries and states and leadership that were delivering land reform, social reform, distribution of wealth, and pro-south and are non-aligned at that time world policy. Who benefits the most. It\u2019s clear that the winners are the State of Israel and its Western backers, and the losers are the people of the region. Common people understand this but they are unable to prevent as their leaders most of them are puppets to capitalism Presidents first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia is the best example, USA a democratic nation and KSA a monarchy strange bed fellows Most countries have fundamentalist groups of some sort. The thing that usually keeps them from gaining power is the state - intelligence agencies keep tabs on them, the police arrest them if they even start to break laws, etc. When the state breaks down, they\u2019re free to do what they want. So they start getting more violent, and getting more powerful. Once they start getting power, they\u2019re able to recruit a lot more people, partly because people are just looking for protection in a chaotic situation. Religious fundamentalist groups in particular have an edge, because - who\u2019s more likely to stay in an area in crisis: someone who sees it as a political crisis and sees themselves as a potential victim, or someone who sees it as part of God\u2019s plan and sees themselves as a servant of God\u2019s will? Who\u2019s more likely to fight? Fundamentalist religious groups flourish in bad times because they\u2019re the ones who stick around and don\u2019t stop fighting (even when it\u2019s really, really stupid to keep fighting). It\u2019s not a uniquely Muslim issue. Is it a crime to defend ones self? And what you are saying is not applicable on Muslim countries alone. Wherever there is repression or oppression there is a protest. In Muslim countries the repression occurs in different disguises. Invasions and air attacks are said to start against those who are staging violent anti-government protests. A foreign power is usually seen to sympathise with the local government. It helps by quelling these protests and agitations. Later, depending upon on how things work-out between the local govt and the foreign power. The government makes a few arrests of persons leading the protests labelling them as fundamentalists and extremists. And by this time it is actually forgotten what started the fracas. But the fundamentalist, who actually fought for his rights is now cooling his heels in jail. Even those are labelled fundamentalists who have hardly anything at all to do with religion. Btw, may I ask who is a fundamentalist? What is meant today when someone is labelled as a fundamentalist. Someone who is a zealot. An extremist. What fundamentalist really means is: a person who believes in the strict, literal interpretation of scripture in a religion. Tell me what is wrong with that? Please note that Muslim countries, which happen to be in the Middle East were colonised by today\u2019s western Powers. They left behind a huge number of martyrs, orphans, widows and terrible hostility and a general feeling of revenge. Although most of this happened in the past but it keeps happening again and again. Most recently by the USA. it is a everlasting method for dealing with the crisis and rebellion. if people are unrested because of political or economical problems, it is an easier way to hide the problems behind the curtain of religion for rulers to get away with them.",

Some of them are petty beyond belief. Arbitrary rules about restroom access  Teachers are caught in the middle, between kids who need to go and administrators that want to discourage them . Rules requiring that all drugs (otc and prescription) be kept with the school nurse  Somehow when I was in secondary school, we managed to carry and take an aspirin or an antibiotic without it becoming a problem. Who was the worst teacher or professor you've come across? Has a teacher ever skipped school? Is it okay for a teacher to shove me in the head? What should a teacher do on the first day of class? Do I have to comply to a teacher's rules if they are not enforced by the school? I know this is maybe intended to be about rules for the students, but the teachers need to abide by some rules too. Recently my school had a meeting that ended with the administrators telling the teachers we can\u2019t use our phones in class\u2014except to take attendance at the beginning. They also added that we can\u2019t sit down in class anymore; they\u2019d be removing the chairs by the teachers\u2019 podiums. I pretty strongly disagree with both of these and can\u2019t see a good reason for either of them. Cell phones I get it. They can be really distracting. And it\u2019s definitely good to avoid playing mobile games in class, both as a student and teacher. But no cell phone at all? If there\u2019s a problem with a student or the curriculum and I need to talk to another teacher, or, heck, if I need to sneakily look up a definition\u2026 I don\u2019t know. There are plenty of good reasons for teachers to keep their phones at arm\u2019s length. Sitting Seriously? We work for 7 hours straight, standing, with brief breaks in between classes. Teachers shouldn\u2019t sit, of course, during the entire class period. And it\u2019s a little suspect to teach while sitting. But when students are working quietly and showing no signs of needing assistance? Come on. There\u2019s no need to stand around and hover. I gotta jump on the \u201cdress codes are a waste of time\u201d band wagon here. Seeing highly educated professionals having serious debates about what constitutes a logo on a t-shirt that is too large to be allowed under the dress code is ridiculous. And the hours I have spent being lectured by administrators on the appropriate length for a student\u2019s skirt is equally annoying. Here\u2019s some advice to all the male teachers out there: Don\u2019t stare at your female students skirts or shirts. My basic rule is and always has been \u201cDon\u2019t dress like a skank, and I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d It works well for me. My college has a a rule against food in the classrooms. Many of my students, especially in the evening classes, have tight schedules and have come right from work to class with no time to eat. I would much rather they eat in class than either sit there hungry or come in late. I allow eating in class, but try to insist on clean-up. There is also a rule against parents bringing their children to class. At the same time, the break and holiday schedules for the community college and the local K-12 schools are not synchronized, creating child care problems when we are in session and the kids\u2019 schools are not. And there are always emergencies when child care plans fall through. It\u2019s not as if the college provides child care resources, or anything like that. About half my students are parents, and I allow kids in class if there is no other solution, and they cause no disruption. The reason given for the prohibition is \u201cliability issues.\u201d My students are immigrants, and only an American could imagine that anyone is liable for kids except their parents in such a setting. I have been called in about kids in the classroom several times, and now the administration has given up.

The Next Day, It Was Time To Put It Behind Them And Focus Their Energy On Preparing For Their Next Challenge. His Philosophy Was That If You Keep Your Failures And Victories In Perspective, You'll Do Better In The Long Run. What does a person do if he/she fails in love? What should I do if I find life a meaningless pursuit? What should a person do when he fails in his life? Is that reasonable that a person has no friend in his/her life? If so, does he/she have to be afraid? When does one know what he/she wants in life? If you\u2019re determined to perform a task and failed in it, then there is nothing to worry. Failures teach you those lessons which nobody else can teach you. Failures just tells you that you just need to do abit more hard work in your task to become successful. Failures provides you experiences which you\u2019ll never forget and also bring new ideas in your mind. If you have failed in a task and you know very well that you\u2019re interested in that task, then  Try again . Never give up at any cost, at last you\u2019ll win. Always remember  \u201cFailures are the steps towards Success\u201d  :) I hope this might help you :) Feel free to ask!! Stay happy :) Thanks for asking! \u201cYou never fail. You either win or you learn.\u201d Change your mindset and understand that failing is just how you think about something that you did not win and you should rather concentrate on what you can learn from not winning that something. When you come in fifth in a contest or when you finish last in your exam or when you did not get that dream job you always wanted, analyze the situation and yourself and see where you could have made a mistake, or where you could improve. Everybody fails in life. Most people fail many times until they get something right. You can\u2019t just look at successful people and wish you were like them or wish you were them. You have to work hard to be like them. You have to learn, improve and get better to be like them. Accept that you failed. Try and learn from your mistakes. You should be able to recognise them  and not repeat the same mistakes! Believe  that you can come back . Belive  that you can work harder than ever. Trust your instincts! Don't doubt your abilities. Identify what you do best and  GET TO WORK!",

        "a": "Python doesn\u2019t offer any particular advantage over shell scripting for this purpose. The issue here is that you want to delegate some special level of privilege to a program (which is what  sudo  does according to the settings provided in the  /etc/sudoers  file as maintained by the  visudo  wrapper/utility). Classically Unix only offers two features for delegation of privilege through some command. The first is through the use of the SUID and SGID (also called the setUID and setGID) bits in an executable file\u2019s mode (permissions). When an executable is marked SUID (has the +04000 permissions/mode bit set) then it the Unix kernel grants any process executing that program an \u201ceffective\u201d UID matching the owner of the file. (The default is that processes have an effective UID matching the user\u2019s UID for executing normal programs). Similarly when an executable with the SGID bit is run the resulting process will have the group ID associated with the file added to its list of supplemental group memberships. One problem with using SGID and SUID programs is that  the setting is ignored on scripts  for most modern versions of Unix (including Linux). In other words it\u2019s only honored for binary (compiled) executable files and NOT for any file that\u2019s plain text (with a  #!  magic line). For some additional insights read:  The suidperl Story (The detail of Unix is the result of some inherent race conditions that were found in early implementations of \u201cshebang\u201d magic \u2014 on how the interpreter was loaded and passed a file descriptor to the script; but it\u2019s become the default and can\u2019t be over-ridden on many versions of Unix. So basically just don\u2019t go there on trying to make SUID/SGID  scripts ). Another problem with SUID (and, to a lesser extent SGID) programs, binary executables, is that any bug in the program can be exploited to completely compromised the delegated credentials (user or group). Since C is the most commonly available compiler for writing such programs creating SUID/SGID programs becomes a trip through the minefield of secure, robust, bug-free C coding. Don\u2019t go there. If you do take up that crusade and you master C to the point where you can reliably write such code \u2014 than make that your career. The  sudo  utility is a program which uses the SUID mechanism. It is written and maintained in C by some of the best programmers around and it acts as a generalized wrapper, reading the  /etc/sudoers  file and executing programs under specific credentials and optionally with specific environment settings and constraints on the command line arguments. Perl used to support an optional feature called  suidperl  (removed in Perl 5.12 according to  perl5120delta - search.cpan.org ). If a Perl script is SUID and this  suidperl  executable was available on the PATH then the Perl interpreter would re-execute the script using that alternative executable. Despite their efforts over the years, vulnerabilities were occasionally discovered and fixed. But  sudo  has been adopted as the preferred solution to the underlying problem. Similarly Python used to support an \u201crexec/Bastion\u201d feature/module. But that was removed over a decade ago (circa Python version 2.2). Here\u2019s a discussion on that:  Bastion/rexec use cases? You could, perhaps, write your program in  Go (lang) . This is considerably less of a minefield than C; many of the flaws which are easy to make in C are not possible in Go. However it\u2019s still tricky and  sudo  is still protecting you from a host of vulnerabilities that were discovered by security researchers over the decades that Unix has been deployed over millions of systems and generations of hardware architecture. Another, perhaps even better, option would be to write something in  Rust . Again the Rust programming language is designed to be far less treacherous than C \u2026 benefitting, as Go does, from decades of hard-learned lessons about robust programming. On top of that Rust defaults to immutable data types and uses extremely explicit semantics around mutation; while this makes learning Rust more challenging, it also makes certainly classes of bugs much less likely be written into your code. Despite the advantages of Go and Rust for writing code without trivially exploitable buffer overflows, format string, and similar bugs \u2026 writing wrappers to enforce policy (which is the whole point of any SUID/SGID utility) is tricky. But it\u2019s about on par with writing scripts that can be safely run by  sudo . The whole other mechanism for delegation available across the range of Unix systems is the \u201cdaemonic\u201d approach. Your program is run as a  daemon  (or even as a  cron  job) and you communicate with that process via some means have it provide a service. It has privileged access and it\u2019s handling of these request entails enforcing your policies. In your case (performing periodic backups) you could simply run the existing shell script (minus  sudo ) as a  cron  job by the root user (or by any user with access to all of the target files and directories). This is still a example of using the \u201cdaemonic\u201d approach because  cron  is a daemon that\u2019s running on almost every Unix system. Another approach would be to create a special  ssh authorized_keys  file/entry which enables a user with access to a specific private key to trigger the execution of a given command. Here\u2019s an example of how to do that:  Restrict SSH logins to a single command . I used to know a quite respectable Unix systems engineer who eschewed  sudo  completely in favor of this alternative. This is yet another example of the \u201cdaemonic\u201d approach because, of course,  sshd  is a daemon that must be running in order for you to use it. As noted in that Kudelski Security - Research article the programs you run via this means must be audited and written robustly if they handle any externally/remotely supplied data and arguments. But they gloss over the details. It turns out that a general purpose user shell (such as  bash ) has many features (especially magic environment variables) which can be used to trick the remote shell into executing arbitrary code. Some of that is covered in this question on ServerFault:  Can a command be executed over ssh with a nologin user? Ther have been a number of programs written specifically to be invoked by  sshd  via the  command=  authorized keys mechanism. Many of those have had bugs and, almost certainly, many still do. So, no matter how you slice it, keeping a Unix or Unix-like system secure and delegating limited access is difficult.  sudo  is currently the standard means for doing this on Linux and most other forms of Unix. It\u2019s probably best to stick with that approach unless you have a compelling reason and are willing to devote considerable effort into learning deep, gory details of Unix security and secure coding practices. I\u2019ll close this (already excessively long) missive with some random links that I came across while writing it (and one which I remember from many years ago as relevant to the discussion): The Confused Deputy  (or  Confused deputy problem - Wikipedia ) Thoughts on the Systemd Root Exploit Dynamic linker tricks: Using LD_PRELOAD to cheat, inject features and investigate programs Why can't I use sudo commands in Ubuntu? How do I make a script file excute without using sudo in bash script? While using  sudo  command to change a directory, why is it showing me this warning message? How do I use cd command in Python? What is the best IDE for Python? Thanks for A2A. I see you got some great answers, so I will keep it simple: edit the script with any editor and remove the word \u201csudo\u201d. You are running  find  on a local (probably unprivileged) directory, so you don't need special permissions. The other points that were mentioned are valid also: This is a  shell , not a  python , script. Look at the  shebang  on line 1 (fancy word to say #!). Sudo needs adding your user to /etc/sudoers. Try to reduce this behavior whenever you can. Going  suid  on a trivial job like finding jpg files in a local directory seems silly. Suid programs can be dangerous if you don\u2019t know what you are doing. You\u2019re not using sudo for the tar command in this. sudo is being used for the find \u2014 it won\u2019t apply to anything after the pipe, which will all be run un-sudoed. This also isn\u2019t a Python program. It\u2019s a bash script. Simply remove \u201csudo\u201d and the following space, and you won\u2019t be using sudo at all in this script. Since I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019re completely unfamiliar with scripting (since you believed this was Python and that the tar command was being run under sudo), I\u2019ll note as well that as this is written, it\u2019s only backing up files that end with \u201c.jpg\u201d that are also 200KB in size or larger. WARNING USE WITH CARE: SUID PROGRAMS ARE GREAT LOOPHOLES. There are bits suid-group and suid-user. You can make a tiny suid program running your script with a controlled environment. But be careful. One careless step and you shoot your leg. See  setuid .",

        "a": "I believe it does but not exactly for the reasons people think. The paleo diet is eating the way our ancestors would have up to 10,000 years ago, or when the age of agriculture started. This means no grains, dairy etc but focusing on protein, fruits, and vegetables. The problem is no one is eating a true paleolithic diet these days as many of the foods we have now didn\u2019t exist in paleolithic times. Or, they have developed into something totally different. A good example is the banana, they originated in South East Asia and were short, very fibrous and so full of seeds they would be pretty much inedible. Compare this to our bright yellow, sweet, and pretty much seedless versions today. The main thing with paleo is that we focus on real whole foods. And it\u2019s not what the paleo diet includes, it\u2019s what it DOES NOT include. There are no artificial flavors and sweeteners, there isn\u2019t any refined carbs and flours or sugars. It\u2019s free from trans fats, high fructose corn syrup and additives. I believe this is the approach that makes the paleo diet so effective. I\u2019ve got a blog post that goes much more in depth on all things paleo here:  Everything you need to know about the paleo diet What  did  live up to the hype? What is among the most overrated and hyped thing in India? Is the paleo diet really the optimal diet for humans? Why or why not? How can I live an organic, paleo diet, non-toxic life in Ensenada? Where do I get products? I have to be here right now. How can I make tasty eggs on the paleo diet? There\u2019s much backlash against the Paleo diet but I believe that it is a reflex against the trendiness of it and lack of awareness rather than the merits of the diet itself. Some also see it as a threat to political ideologies, since it promotes the consumption of animals and the harm that comes with it (to the animals and environment). The Paleo diet in its original and purest form conforms to the ideals of many nutritionists. It is a balanced, high nutrient density diet that\u2019s microbiome friendly and low-glycemic. Processed foods are replaced with whole, minimally processed foods. Naturally raised animals are favored over their industrialized equivalents. Really, what\u2019s  not  to like about these things?? What it is not is a way to lose weigtht. It can help you not gain it but you still need to tailor it to achieve that goal. Rather, it is a lifestyle which promotes healthy living and, as such, affects the decisions made in life outside of nutrition, from sleeping habits to parenting to fitness. What many don\u2019t realize is that while a food can be made to be Paleo, replacing standard American diet (SAD) foods with Paleo equivalents does not entail that one is following a Paleo diet. That\u2019s because the spirit of the diet is lost along the way. A diet is defined by how foods are assembled rather than the components of the diet itself. Keeping that property in mind, there are many other diets possible which could achieve the same goals but in my experience they are less effective at achieving them.",

We like Puerto Rico and had made the decision to purchase a place that would be second home for a bit and eventually full time home. As a protectorate it uses to some degree our Constitution BUT they had passed stupid gun laws that defeated the Second Amendment. I checked with gun stores and instructors, almost all active duty or retired LEOs, was told there was no way I could have a gun there. I\u2019m glad I had not said anything about what I was carrying at the time. We heard later that the law was thrown out but if they did it once they could do it again . . .. love the country, hate the politics How can people live in the US knowing that guns are legal? How does an average American gun-owning citizen rationally justify his/her possession of gun(s)? Which is the best country in the world to become a citizen of? Why don't the European countries give their citizens the freedom to own guns? Can I keep a live bullet without having a gun license? Definitely not. In fact, I\u2019m considering moving out of California because of the state government\u2019s dedication to eroding constitutional rights. There was a time in my life where I didn\u2019t care one way or the other about firearms. There was a time when I didn\u2019t know my muzzle from my breach. When I moved to the little Northern Californian town where I currently live, I hated it. I wanted to be in Sacramento where there was at least  something  to do. This was before I realized I had an interest in firearms. As someone who can research, has relatives in other countries, has a profession, and some disposable income, I am probably more empowered than others to move to another country. I could go off to some other country and be a teacher at an international school. I have no interest. I would say that my ability to defend myself is one of the deciding factors in that choice. No! For all the fear and posturing by other answers to this question, keep in mind that  there are an estimated 300 to 400 MILLION firearms in the possession of approximately 100 million private citizens in the United States.  If even any portion of the anti-gun, mandatory training, government permission, rhetoric made any sense the U.S. streets would be awash with blood on a daily basis. And yet they aren\u2019t. How can this possibly be? It\u2019s because the vast majority of death by firearms (60%-70%) are suicides. And statistics show that people who wish to commit suicide will choose another method if they do not have access to guns so the firearm itself is seldom the determining factor, it is just very efficient. Of the third that are not suicides more than half are gang violence - criminals shooting other criminals and take place in specific high-violence urban areas. Fewer than 6,000 actual homicides from criminal activity, domestic violence or supposed \u201cmass murders\u201d occur each year in a population of well over 320 million people. That\u2019s about 0.0016%. As for accidental shootings, more people drown in their swimming pools each year than are shot accidentally. The vast majority of Americans who own guns, and carry guns, are peaceful, law-abiding citizens who never commit any serious crimes, much less commit crimes with their guns. As a matter of fact it has been shown that police officers commit more crimes than the 12 million citizens licensed to carry firearms! So the only people who really want to live in a country where the average citizen cannot posses or carry a firearm are criminals and political tyrants. Neither of those social groups appreciates effective opposition to their aims. In a word, not No but HELL No. I admit, I\u2019m one of those \u201cgun nuts\u201d. I\u2019ve owned, bought , sold, traded, enjoyed, hunted to feed myself and others, shot targets and clay for enjoyment, open carried, concealed carried, made my living a few times from carrying a gun, and even got paid for fixing a few guns and for reloading cartridges. I\u2019ve even spent some time being trained and training others on safety and use of firearms. This is my culture and this is what I know and how I live. I wouldn\u2019t feel the least bit safer in a place where no one had a gun even if I were the only person around that had one. Even though I often carry a gun and have regularly for the last almost sixty years, there are times I don\u2019t. At those times, I don\u2019t feel either naked or afraid in my surroundings because I know someone in the neighborhood is armed, and I feel that while I may be being a sheep at the moment, there will hopefully be a sheep dog around if need be. There have been times in all those years that I have needed my guns. Those haven\u2019t occurred often and haven\u2019t resulted in a single shooting scrape. That\u2019s OK by me, when it comes to my firearm, I\u2019d much rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it. I\u2019ve trained hard to know what to do if I find myself in a situation where I needed it and prayed fervently that I never found myself in the situation. I really do wish I had a working crystal ball to tell me that on X day at X time I would need to be prepared to defend myself from X situation. I\u2019ve tried Tarot cards, Weji boards, tea leaves, and psychic divination and they didn\u2019t work any better than my nonworking crystal ball for telling me the future so I intend to just keep on keeping on with being prepared, trained and armed, and hoping it\u2019s completely unnecessary. If everyone around me carried an AR-15, a side arm, and had a backpacked shotgun I wouldn\u2019t be worried like I would if I knew none of the people around me were armed or had a clue what to do if they found themselves in a situation where they should need to defend themselves. I trust my fellow legal gun owners and they trust me, and so far that hasn\u2019t presented a problem. If I could get some of my fellow motor vehicle owners to always behave as responsibly as my fellow firearms owners it would make for a better world.

        "a": "To ascertain whether this is true we would first need to determine if Christianity is true, and if there is a true version of it.  Otherwise we fall prey to the  No true Scotsman fallacy  and we have no basis to determine whether anyone is on the right track or not. One would need to prove that god(s) exist, that the God of Abraham is the one true God, and that the Christians have it right while Jews and Muslims don\u2019t. If one could find sufficient evidence in support of that one would then need to determine if there was one true version of Christianity. How could we establish that such a thing exists? How could we determine which version is the right version?  Religions evolve and change. The bible comes in myriad versions and translations and has been rearranged in the past. Would the true version be that which was practiced at the onset, when it stopped being an offshoot of Judaism and became it\u2019s own religion? How much do we know about the way the faith was practiced at the time? Are there Christians today who still follow the original ways? Would it be one of several versions espousing  Biblical literalism  and  Biblical inerrancy ? Those are relatively recent beliefs.  Augustine of Hippo  didn\u2019t take a fully literal approach to scripture, while many modern fundamentalists do. If they are right then it would mean that people had it wrong for many hundreds of years. If we could conclude that Christianity is the true religion I don\u2019t know how one would decide which (if any) version is the correct one.  One cannot claim that others are not following the true version unless one has established what the true version is.  Without that it is simply a matter of people arguing about who is right. Is Russia an Asian or European country? Will I be considered a white person in the US? Is it true that Europeans take baths/showers less often than Americans? If so, why? What North American city feels the most European? Am I the only one who is bothered about the fact that people from the USA call themselves Americans? \u201cI don\u2019t mean to offend anyone\u201d And nevertheless, here we are. You\u2019re basically accusing millions of people of profound hypocrisy. This is inherently offensive. Not being a Christian, I don\u2019t take offense myself, but it\u2019s quite obvious that you\u2019ve phrased your question in a quite stunningly clumsy manner and you could hardly be more offensive if you tried. So, then, how does one explain the discrepancy between the ideals of Christianity and the behavior of purported Christians? For one thing, there\u2019s always a gap between what a religion tells people to do and what they actually do. Muslims drink alcohol (indeed, they\u2019ve been  drinking a lot more in recent years ). Buddhists eat meat. People in every country murder and rape and steal despite their religions telling them not to. What Christians do despite religious prohibition is par for the course. Moreover, Christianity sort of expects this, though different sects deal with it in different ways. Christianity holds that humans are inherently flawed. We are all, by nature, sinners, but by faith our sins may be forgiven. One of the subtle implications here is that Christianity is a religion of belief, not practice. The practical tenets of the religion, particularly in the various flavors of Protestantism, are an idealized goal but acknowledged to be difficult to achieve. If you were to come to, say, the American south and turn on the radio\u2014believe me, it\u2019s a fascinating anthropological exercise; if you\u2019re lucky, you may get to hear from snake handlers, or at least their sympathizers\u2014you\u2019d quickly find Christian radio stations where preachers endlessly emphasize faith. They talk about things that people should or shouldn\u2019t do as well, of course, but it all starts with faith. It is this belief in Christ which is the pillar of the salvation Christians go on endlessly about, and everything else flows from that. Christianity has always been very big on forgiveness (after all, the whole point if it is divine forgiveness for human sins), so various forms of it have taken what may look to outsiders like a remarkably lenient view of misbehavior. So it\u2019s not necessarily that Christians are bad at Christianity. It\u2019s that Christians are as bad as everybody else at following the practical rules of their religion, whatever that might be, but are allowed to be a bit more open about it. America\u2019s churches split in have roughly 200 years ago; one set for the North, another for the South. In that time, many of the Northern set of churches argued that slavery is unChristian, and an affront to God. Meanwhile, most Southern churches pointed to the references to slaves in the Bible (mostly in the Old Testament) and used that as a platform to argue that Christianity sanctified slavery. Nowadays, that fight has been long over, but the schism between the churches is not. In truth, no matter how you look at it, if Christianity is the one true way to follow God, there shouldn\u2019t be two (or many more) contradictory sets of beliefs on what God wants. Add to that the fact that many people feel that your belief is more important than your actions, and you get a lot of what many American Christians (and probably man others) who do not follow the rules of the Bible. I was told once by a man who came onto the campus I worked at to proselytize, that Christ was not a title, but Jesus\u2019 last name. This defied everything I\u2019d read in the Bible, my historical knowledge of when last names started in the Western World, and everything my priests and Catholic school teachers taught me. I asked him, \u201cyou mean he was Jesus Christ, son of Mary Christ and Joseph Christ?\u201d and he said yes. So obviously even some missionaries didn\u2019t read all that much of the Bible, unless they have a version somewhere that went against both my Catholic Bible and the King James version. Because none of us are in a position to make moral judgements about who is or isn\u2019t a Christian, Muslim, Buddhist or whatever. History is bloated with examples of sects denying the existence of other sects, but there is never any authority that can define who is or is not a Christian. You don\u2019t have that authority. Why should your version of Christianity be the preferred one? What you just did is called the \u201cNo True Scotsman\u201d fallacy, and it\u2019s why, in general, media, demographers, historians, politicians, etc., call anyone a Christian who identifies as such. Else, we need to figure out who is capable of deciding. Hell, the Bible even flat out states on several occasions that  no man is without sin. There\u2019s: Romans 3:23 Genesis 8:21 1 Kings 8:46 Ecclesiastes 7:20 Romans 3:9 See, if I did like you, I might question whether or not you\u2019re a \u201ctrue\u201d Christian, because you apparently don\u2019t follow these teachings. But I won\u2019t, because I know better. Who does otherwise? Is there really a measurable community that really practice some religion? Aliaksandar Lukashenka, Belarusian dictator, once replied when asked by a reporter what religion he keeps, that he is \u2018Orthodox atheist\u2019. Many people used this to show how dumb he was, but in fact, what he told is a great explanation of what overwhelming majority of people in the world are: atheists, but coming with a cultural background which is a product of multigenerational practice of some religion. Many of these people think they are religious, while in fact they are not: they keep what stays from the religion once faith of God is removed. And that is quite a lot, that forms most of what someone\u2019s cultural background is. For Muslims of that sort (and that is like, almost all Muslims, except some extreme hardliners) there is a special term - \u2018ethnic Muslims\u2019, while in fact, it applies to every religion on the planet. We live in a secular and mostly atheist world, but our cultural backgrounds that stem from religion still matter a lot. So much that many mistake it for their own faith. People who our ancestors 100 years ago would accept as true believers are now extremists and would end up in jail in most of the countries for their extreme views and practices. Or at best, would be laughed off as total freaks.",

Although there is always the chinese knock offs, Google maintained a central dominating architecture because all the developers contributed on their repository. It also allows other hardware companies the collaborate and build the operating system growth. Open source also ofcourse leads to exploits and jailbreaks, but since it's open source more developers can identify them and fix. I think if Apple and Microsoft open sourced their operating systems I think ultimately the users would have more features and a better experience. Their operating systems would be more perfect and more growth based. Why hasn't any company been able to create a non-open source operating system to compete with Microsoft's Windows? Which company will fall first: Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, or Microsoft? Is any open source software included in the Microsoft Windows series of operating systems? Is Microsoft Windows 10 basically a spying operating system? Why are there no open source car operating systems? Google pretty much already open-sourced their OS. Microsoft and Apple on the other hand would lead to a lot more hacks because the code would be a lot lazier when nobody can see it. There was a huge SSL hack on all Apple devices a few years ago because some developer forgot to put brackets on an \u201cif\u201d statement so the last statement always ran and accepted any certificate.

The Thunder must now build around him effectively to truly unlock his potential/value and prevent him from running himself into the ground. The Doug McBuckets/Taj trade was good. Taj is better than Enes and his rebounding/energy was valuable for the Thunder. Unfortunately, the problem is that Taj is better than Enes but Taj is an UFA and Enes has a 17M cap hit next year (he will probably opt out of his fourth year to pursue a longer deal). Doug added 3 point shooting and I think that with an entire offseason to integrate, he will be a good piece to help spread the floor for Russ moving forward. I\u2019m convinced Billy Donovan is a good coach. The adjustments he made last year in the playoffs showed that he is capable of trying things out and changing things around to win. That\u2019s a good thing to have. Things to dislike: Enes Kanter\u2019s contract. Matching his offer was stupid and a desperate play by Presti to retain talent in the hopes of keeping KD. The dude can hardly play. He gets so f*****g exposed on defense it\u2019s hard to watch. His contract is so bad at this point that they\u2019d probably have to throw in multiple picks to dump it. Damn it, damn it, damn it, Presti! Steven Adams + Victor Oladipo didn\u2019t make the leap. These two really need to make a leap to justify the near-max salaries they received in their contract extensions. Each of their four year extensions kick in this year and it\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult to build moving forward with their level of production for a combined ~$46M/year. What now: Try to extend Roberson before a desperate team throws way too much money at him. I think they have a chance of doing so by giving him a four year deal with a player option for the fourth year, giving Andre some protection and the ability to jump back into FA during his peak prime. Signing him to a 4 year / $48-$56M deal would be a great value. Let Taj walk. He\u2019s going to get paid a lot of money by the Nets so just let him go. Dump Kanter\u2019s contract. Don\u2019t give up anything more than a late first to do so, but clearing 19M in cap room and avoiding the tax is more valuable than the 25th pick. Try to get rid of Singler\u2019s contract. This was a failed attempt by Presti to capitalize on the value on the back end of a five year contract for Singler. Sam thought that by giving him a modest 5 year / $25M deal (fifth is a team option), the back two and maybe even three years would look like absolute steals as the cap jumped. Unfortunately, it was a poor gamble by Presti because Singler is trash. Bring back Nick Collison at the veteran\u2019s minimum/mini mid-level exception after FA is over. Throw a 5 yr super max at Westbrook (somewhere in the $218-$222M range) Bank on internal improvement, a more balanced game from Westbrook, and leaps from Adams/Oladipo/Roberson/Sabonis Bottom Line: The Thunder really screwed themselves. They\u2019re stuck with a bunch of fun, interesting pieces, but they just don\u2019t fit together. They\u2019re cap strapped, low on draft capital, and built odd. Let\u2019s see what Sam has up his sleeves! Will the Lakers make the playoffs in the 2016-2017 NBA season? NBA: What will Victor Oladipo bring to the OKC Thunder? How are the Hawks off to such a good start this season? What is it like to play for the Oklahoma City Thunder? Can the thunder win the finals in 2015-2016? Try and get a good deal in exchange for  Enes   Kanter . Maybe trade superstar Westbrook for a another superstar or a up-and-coming player plus draft picks\u2026",

In the same village there was a woman named sarita and her advocate husband shivam.They decided to teach him a  lesson. So  they went to his place and told him about a big deal which they would like to make with him. He asked what's the deal?? Then sarita told him she would like to sell her property to him at rate starting with 10\u20b9 and then using maths she would increase the prices. Hearing the starting money as 10\u20b9 he said yes and signed the papers.Now he could not deny the deal. Later on sarita told him that, She would sell her chicken for \u20b910 Goat for \u20b9100 Cow for \u20b910000 Car for \u20b9100000000 And hence she kept on increasing the prices\u2026 Devprasad was shocked andaccording to the will he couldn't deny hence he gave all his property to sarita.

According to the statement issued by  International Court of Justice  (ICJ), it is not good news for Pakistan. The hanging has been put on hold until the verdict is out. So  probably , the verdict might go in India\u2019s favor. In that case, it will be a very tough decision for Pakistan to hang him. Because, if tomorrow India disagrees to share water and  dismiss  the   Indus Water treaty , whom will Pakistan approach? They will already set up the benchmark of not following International rules, so there is noting they can do to prevent it from happening. And this action by India will have a lot of impact on Pakistan\u2019s economy. Also, if the ICJ orders are not followed, ICJ will table the concerns to  United Nations Security Council  (UNSC). Pakistan, which is also a member of UNSC, will either be thrown out or will face sanctions. This is going to be a very tough choice and I can assure you there will be lot of internal debates between the Army and the Pakistan Government. Time will say whose decision prevails. What Americans think about the death sentence given by Pakistan to the RAW terrorist Kalboshan Yadav? What is your opinion on Pakistan's decision on hanging 500 terrorists? Who are the top ten terrorists in Pakistan? Why India is not declaring Pakistan a terrorist state? Is Lakhvi not a terrorist in the eyes of Pakistan? When the process completes its due course, or when the Hague decides. Whatever comes last: Jadhav's trial lasted three and a half months and the charges he was convicted for included spying for India, waging war against Pakistan, sponsoring terrorism, and destabilising the state. He was tried in a military court due to his naval background and the sensitive nature of his case, involving espionage and sabotage. The sentence was confirmed by army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, and released via the ISPR. Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif stated that under the provisions of the Pakistan Army Act of 1952, Jadhav had the right to appeal against his conviction on three appellate forums within 40 days. As we have seen with terrorists convicted by military courts, Yadav can appeal in the forums (which will include Anti Terrorism Court, a High Court, and the Supreme Court unless I am gravely mistaken. Feel free to correct me). He can also request a Presidential Pardon should the forums decide against him. That was how it should\u2019ve been until the Hague intervened. The Hague has maintained two important points: Pakistan will not hang Yadav until the Hague decides. Pakistan will allow India consular access to Yadav. So basically its two things running simultaneously. And the sentence is carried out (or not) when both options complete their due course. And, of course, just so trolls don\u2019t ruin this answer, I hope that it is peace that prevails.",

If all else fails go to your mayor's office and ask him/her where to look. your local library, or local university are good places to start. another very good place for corroborative or sourse materials are your local courthouse, or equivalent registrar or clerk archives. from there you can document births, marriages, real estate transactions, records of deaths, for individuals locally. the library or the university can provide the info or broad sweep of events, the local records can place individuals there. do not overlook bound or microfilmed newspapers and magazines for the contemporary flavor of facts, events, and opinions. Find your nearest city/town/region museum or research back issues of your area newspapers at their facilities or at your nearest library. Most likely they will be preserved on microfilm.",

This part of the world was doing all kind of experiments from monarchy to democracy. Bhaarat was, what the country really was, established by Bharat the King. All its history till Ashoka and All the Jaychands. In such Bhaarat :- Religions were flourishing. Even evolving. No religious clashes were there. India was source for religion for rest of the known world, be it China, Japan, Indonesia, Cambodia etc. Then it became Hindostaan [2]  . Hindostaan lived a short life. where:- Its art really emerged. Amalgamation of culture happened what founded the Now diverse India. Samosa, Kachori, Biriyani, Qualeen, shaawls and sherwanis are the remnants of this era. And then it became India , As British, Dutch and Portuguese saw it. right beyond Indus. its the modern day India [3]  . Above were my views, Go for footnotes. It describes better. Thanks For Reading. Jai Hind. Footnotes [1]  Vedic period - Wikipedia [2]  Hindustan - Wikipedia [3]  India - Wikipedia What is difference between India and Bharat as names? What is the difference between India and the United States of America? What are the differences in India between 90s kids and today's kids? What is the difference between India and Russia? What is the difference between Nepal and India? Two of the words we often use for our country are India and Bharat. The word India comes from the Indus, called Sindhu in Sanskrit.\u00a0 The Iranians and the Greeks who came through the northwest about 2500 years ago and were familiar with the Indus, called it the Hindos or the Indos, and the land to the east of the river was called India. The name Bharata was used for a group of people who lived in the northwest, and who are mentioned in the Rigveda, the earliest composition in Sanskrit (dated to about3500 years ago). Later it was used for the country. Article 1 of Indian Constitution states that, India i.e Bharat shall be a Union of states. Both are names of India. Western people couldn't pronounce \u201cs\u201d properly, so they pronounced \u201cSindhu River\u201d as \u201cIndus River\u201d. Land beyond Indus was called India and people of India were Indians. Legends say, that name  Bh\u0101rat (\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924)  came from emperor  Bharat (\u092d\u0930\u0924). Bharat (\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924) : Generally Bhaarat means \u201cDescendants of Emperor Bharata\u201d. Bharat (\u092d\u0930\u0924) was an anceint emperor who unified India. He was son of King Dushyant and Shakuntala. He was direct ancestor of legendary Kauravas and Pandavas of Mahabharata. So the term \u201cBhaarat\u201d is derived from Bharat and it tries to mean that it's the land of Scions of Bharat. You can call yourself \u201cBhaarat\u201d. So \u201cBhaarat\u201d can be a term for both \u201cIndia\u201d and \u201cIndians\u201d. India : This term got it's name after Indus River. It generally means \u201cThe Land of Indus\u201d. Both are constitutional names of India in Hindi and English.",

The best part of Uniforms is when everyone is dressed alike, competition between students over clothing choices and the teasing of those who are dressed in less expensive or less fashionable outfits is eliminated. There are are many other benefits to it! and believe me it\u2019s actually good to have uniform as it saves a lot of time thinking what to wear tommorrow. Do NFL teams wear new uniforms every game? Do we have to wear a uniform at JUIT? Is it necessary for children to wear school uniforms? Should American kids wear uniforms to school? Should we wear a uniform in LPU? Yes, but it is not the same uniform you need to wear fr the whole week. Here at Chitkara students are nourished in all fields. So, they keep it very interesting. They provide with 2 university shirts and trousers, 2 tees (red+black), blazer, sweater, sweatshirts (grey+black) and a tie.

        "a": "Hi buddy, Yeah! Most probably 90% of the student population will like Velammal once they are into the College! Yeah, Even myself felt so good to study here! One of the best when compared to other Engineering colleges in Chennai. Though everyone might tell few negative comments about the college, you can get the clear picture only if your are inside the campus! Those were the previous image of the college. I have heard some people saying about strict rules followed in the College, but personally I don\u2019t feel its strict! As far as my experience in this college, you have lot more freedom in exhibiting your ideas both technically and non technically without any restrictions! 95% of the Staffs are very student friendly, that they would help you anytime when you are in need of! you are given lots and lots of opportunities to showcase your talents inside and outside the campus in events like symposiums, Project presentations, IEEE events etc etc\u2026, You are provided with sufficient ODs in order to participate in other colleges! Seriously they wont ask you for your CGPA as some college do! Symposium: yeah man, its totally in our hands, no college intervention! There will be complete freedom for students! These events would be the best in your entire 4 years of Engineering! Students will work with full of energy and full freedom! And don\u2019t expect a single penny from the management! The event is totally ours! Culturals: Sorry to say, don\u2019t expect too much! It will be conducted department wise! But don\u2019t worry, you can be satisfied to an extent! Coming to academics, there will be regular tests! But don\u2019t worry you can manage, its not that big deal! Remember almost every college in the city keep exams continuously! The important point here is, they don\u2019t expect you to get maximum marks, they just ask you for a minimum of 50% which is easy to score actually. Remember, they will literally spoon feed you in the all internals, so don\u2019t take the university examinations for granted in which you may end up in trouble! If you didn\u2019t score that 50%, you may have some trouble with respective staffs who will nag you to write retest continuously! Better score that 50%. They see to that you have sufficient attendance, if not you will be asked pay fine! Remember this, Velammal is known for collecting fines!(Huge Amount when compared to other colleges). Industrial Visits: It would be a one day industrial visit in and around Chennai! No long trips! You can get some Knowledge and at the same time you can enjoy as well! Most probably, we would spend only 2 hours or so in the industry! Rest of the time, we do whatever we wish for! Buddy, there is seriously no strict rules! They expect you to maintain decency in the college, which is mandatory for a professional! You can carry your phone, but make sure that you don\u2019t use it in the class hours, even if you use, make sure that you don\u2019t get caught :P But seriously guys, don\u2019t use during class hours, your teachers are very friendly. For the sake of them, don\u2019t do! Make sure you dress decently! Guys are really lucky in this matter! They are not that strict! Girls are asked to wear only chudidhars! I do wear leggings! But actually they say, we should not wear! As far as my knowledge, if its decent enough, you wont be questioned! There is no crap rules like we must not speak to the opposite genders! Absolutely you are given complete freedom to communicate and work together! None will question you, if you are decent enough! Trust me, We have great bonding in our class, there is no differentiation! Finally, campus in small in size, but its decent enough! No Farewell! :( Only defect I used to feel about! Seriously a Better place! Worth studying here! Don\u2019t worry, they have amazing placement records! you are expected to have 60% aggregate and no standing arrears during placements! But these Criteria is given by the organisations, not by the college Management! Velammal would give you hell a lot of good memories for you! May be during the first sem, you may find it difficult to accustom! Finally, Use Velammal for your betterment! They will give you all the support you needed! Its your life after all! when they give you the freedom, use it wisely! Don\u2019t take it for granted. Give respect to the freedom they give you! ALL THE BEST!! P.S: You can easily bunk classes :P But make sure, that you have a better attendance!(mentioned it due to the student\u2019s mentality) If you are very very notorious, you may have some difficult time here! Why don't we go to school during weekends? Is there any reason for this? What are some reasons why people don't volunteer? What are some reasons why parents don't let their child study abroad? What are the main reasons why students from USC don't graduate on time? What are the main 10 reasons why teenagers these days don't go to church? I like velammal just becoz it is inside the city limits rather than other colleges which is somewhere in the outskirts of the city! Here u can communicate with opposite sex easily without any restriction until a problem arises which most of the colleges won't allow! The main thing which i liked in velammal is u can choose ur own mode of transport like outbus, car, bike and you can bring your homemade food! The dress code here is a bit fine. You can wear casual shirts(for boys) and also you can fold ur shirt sleeves which none of the colleges allow! Also if u have a good sports talent the college helps you to grow that! Now the cons, the campus is much smaller than the velammal school which i don't like. Ofcourse, you will be having tests or exams daily and coaching classes if you fail those exams which is so much frustrating! You would having only one week of gap between one exam and the other! This increases ur stress. Good luck lad! Hi nd hlo all generally scl life is one of t best part wth unforgetable memories nd looties tht comes along wth our life train ri8!!!!!!! haha\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 In my aspect ,velammal ehhh one of t best scl bcz as many as activities ,academics nd having ever cooll nd healthy relationships btwn us nd mainly indulge in sports nd bla bla\u2026\u2026..

Keep smiling always. 3.Fiddling with fingers Toying with fingers creates an impression that you are bored or disinterested in the conversation. It may appear to the interviewer that you are not interested in the job at all. 4.Slouching in chair Job seekers often don't realize that how they sit in the chair carries a lot of weight-age in the books of an interviewer.

        "a": "Conor is neither overrated, nor greatest of all time. He is rightfully considered as one of the best to ever fight in UFC. To put in numbers, as of right now, I\u2019d put him in Top 15 easily, possibly in Top 10. But being Top 5 or Top 10 is a really bad measure in case of Conor. When looking for Top fighters, the criteria often used are level and length of dominance. Conor doesn\u2019t care about that. I think if he stayed in Featherweight, he could have dominated it for a long time. But he\u2019s all about the promotion and \u201cmaking history\u201d, in his own way. He doesn\u2019t care about defending the belt, because it\u2019s not big enough for him. Look at his decisions: Fighting Nate, trying to fight May(or may not)weather. Instead of these, he could\u2019ve focused on defending belts, but he didn\u2019t. Conor\u2019s one of the best for one thing: He\u2019s willing to fight, as long as he\u2019s interested. Most of the other champions, they pulled back, sometimes avoided or delayed fights. Conor, I can\u2019t see him pulling back from the fight. ( source ) What entrance song does Conor McGregor use and why? What does Conor McGregor do to be able to cut weight from 170 to 145? Do you think it was okay for Conor McGregor to stay on welfare till he got the UFC contract? Who will win in a UFC fight, Brock Lesnar or Conor McGregor? Who would win a rematch between Conor Mcgregor and Nate Diaz? Yes, Conner McGregor is an overrated MMA fighter. His boxing skills are average and his ground fighting skills are lacking. The general public fails to realize that reach advantages beyond 3 inches become statistically significant in the UFC. It's like the \u201cBoyd Belts\u201d in Jiu-jitsu, where every 20 lbs or 10 years equals a belt. This means a 150lb black belt may actually reach a stalemate against a 250lb white belt. Alternatively, a 25 year old has a \u201cbelt\u201d above a 35 - year old practitioner. This is why there are age and weight divisions in Jiu-jitsu. Open matches only occur afterward and among the very best competitors. And so it is with McGregor, who strategically fights in a lower than normal weight class because he holds an enormous reach advantage over the average, flyweight MMA opponent. Ultimatlely, Conner McGregor \u201cgamed the system\u201d to get paid, and more power to him, as he's about to retire after the upcoming Mayweather Jr. Fight. All speed, abilities, and reflexes equal, McGregor would not be able to easily dominate Aldo, Alvarez, Mendes, etc. without his 3+ inch reach advantage. Those \u201cDavids\u201d would have an equivalent chance of connecting on hooks and jabs with \u201cGoliath (Conner McGregor)\u201d if their reach fell within three inches. Seasoned boxers know that one can step in about three inches before throwing a jab to compensate for any reach disadvantage. However, this hack becomes challenging beyond that three-inch limit. Stepping toward four inches with your lead foot sacrifices your base, predisposing you to an unbalanced fall or a knockout. Where there is no base, there is no balance; hence many fighters fail to win because of poor footwork. Conner McGregor is no exception to the rule. You'll also realize that Mayweather Jr. makes a killing with this subtle footwork technique, which is one reason why he's still undefeated. He authentically respects the \u201csweet science\u201d of boxing and routinely exploits it with his infamous \u201cPhilly Shell.\u201d While McGregor can easily bait shorter opponents, and occasionally show off by placing his hands behind his back, he won't dare do the same against Nate Diaz or Mayweather Jr. Those with trained eyes know better, and Conner does too. Specifically, notice how Conner McGregor suddenly had difficulty when facing Nate Diaz, who had a two-inch reach advantage over him. Boxing Nate was a true measurement of Conner McGregor\u2019s stand up skills, which were equivalent. However, Nate had a competitive advantage on the ground, as he\u2019s an experienced, Jiu-jitsu black belt - Conner McGregor never had a chance. Will he beat Mayweather Jr? Of course not, but they're both professional enough to put on a show for the fans paying to watch. Mayweather Jr. falls within three inches of McGregor\u2019s reach, and Mayweather essentially has a \u201cblack belt\u201d in boxing. Conner simply won't have the veteran reflexes and tricks of a boxing veteran (e.g. forearm crush, head and hook, shoulder roll). McGregor will make a fortune though. Still, I wonder whether Mayweather Jr. will consider losing a second match, like Nate did, to set up a more profitable trilogy match. I think Mayweather Jr. might take it on points, create a \u201ctoo close to call controversy,\u201d then murder him in a third, billion-dollar fight. During McGregor\u2019s second match with Nate Diaz, seeing Conner McGregor intermitantly whisper to Nate Diaz on the octagonal wall makes me wonder whether Nate was smart enough to hold back for a future payday. After all, it's chess, not checkers; and Nate wants the same money as McGregor one day. I'll still pay to watch the McGregor Mayweather Jr. production. Mayweather Jr. will likely measure and effectively calibrate Conner\u2019s movements by the sixth round, then we should see a \u201cseismic shift\u201d in Mayweather Jr's favor. Conner McGregor is surely the one the smartest MMA fighters in his division. He's a gifted, marketing machine with an entire country behind him. If he manages to defend himself for 12 rounds against Mayweather Jr\u2019s 25+ years of pad work and muscle memory, it would be a moral victory that even he will respect. Like Pacquiao, Conner McGregor will also allegedly enter politics after retiring. Genius. Why not control or influence Irish tax laws after making all that money? The fact of the matter is that he is really, really, really, really good. At UFC 189, Conor had spent months training for a striker, but his opponent was changed last minute to a wrestler in Chad Mendes, the worst possible stylistic match-up for the Irishman. Conor had done zero wrestling training in the lead-up to the fight. Result? McGregor wins by knockout At UFC 194, Conor has Jos\u00e9 Aldo, who hasn't lost in a literal decade and is hailed as the best featherweight ever going into the fight. Result? McGregor wins by knockout At UFC 202, he gets Diaz, who appears to be tailor-made to be a McGregor killer. Larger in every aspect, holds his own on the feet, very good on the ground, has cardio for days and a chin made of rock. Result? McGregor wins by majority decision At UFC 205, he faces Eddie Alvarez. Alvarez has one of the strongest records in MMA, has won titles wherever he's gone, is just as big as Conor, has a similar aggressive boxing style, and solid wrestling skills to boot. Result? McGregor wins by knockout And I'm just listing his wins here, not even breaking down his game. His weakest aspect is probably ground-fighting and grappling. However, make no mistake, he's no slouch here. He's a brown belt in pure Jiu-jitsu, which is nothing to scoff at. He doesn't go out of his way to show it off, but it's there more than people realize. He showed excellent submission defense against Chad Mendes, as well as a tremendous ability to avoid damage on the ground. He made throughly out-grappling Max Holloway with an injured leg look easy. He executed a very rare and rather difficult sweep/reversal in the first fight with Nate Diaz. When the need arises, he can hold his own on the ground. Next up is his wrestling game. At one point in time, this was surely his weakest aspect, but that's difficult to say anymore. He showed vastly improved (and I'd even say quite impressive) takedown defense against Eddie Alvarez, who is a formidable wrestler. Despite his skill, Eddie was unable to make any headway on McGregor through a slew of takedown attempts. But, let's not pretend otherwise, McGregor\u2019s bread and butter is his stand-up game. His wide, spinning and swinging kicks encourage his opponents to move in straight lines, lest they walk right into a heel or shin. Once he has them moving how he wants, McGregor unloads straight left hands and leading uppercuts that are laser-precise and pack real power. He's very adaptable, his footwork is tremendous, he has good coaches and training partners, he's fast, he's athletic. His disproportionately long arms enable him to throw hands from almost kicking distance, as well. His chin is made of granite, allowing him to endure extraordinary amounts of punishment. He's the first person in UFC history to be the champ of two divisions simultaneously. He has the fastest title fight victory in UFC history at 13 seconds, over Aldo. He has the most consecutive post-fight bonus awards in UFC history with 8. And he has the most knockouts in UFC featherweight history with six. He's an exceptionally talented fighter, and it gets more and more ridiculous for people to deny that with each passing fight. Cheerio! Don't get me wrong, the guy is good, he\u2019s a great talker, great self-promoter, very smart man and he has single handedly caused the UFC to blow up and become far more popular than it ever has been before. In fact, the company was recently sold for  four billion dollars . Much of this was down to him. However, although he is a good fighter, he is no where near as good as everyone makes him out to be\u2026 The first reason I give for this, is that he is fairly one-dimensional. He's a fantastic striker, but when it comes to anything else, he really isn't that good at it. This is evidenced, by not only his multiple knockout victories against top level opponents (showing how good of a striker and how powerful he really is), but also by his submission loss to Nate Diaz at UFC 196, in which, after being rocked by the much larger Diaz, he attempted to take the fight to the ground in order to recover. This ended very badly for him as he was very quickly tapped out by the much more experienced fighter via a rear naked choke. Next up, is the fact that throughout the majority of his career, Conor McGregor has fought in a weight division that he really doesn't belong in. He has fought the majority of his fights in the Featherweight Division of the UFC, which requires all participants to be 145lb in weight at maximum. Conor McGregor, when seen at this weight prior to his fights, not only looks unbelievable skinny, he looks so thin that he could be seen as unhealthy or unwell! Another indicator of him not belonging in the Featherweight Division is that throughout his career in the division, all of his opponents have been shorter than him. And on the first occasion that he fought a taller fighter,  he lost.  Below I have provided an image of McGregor weighing in at 145lb to give you an idea of just how bad he looks. My next, and final point is that  Conor McGregor has never defended a UFC championship.  Yes, you've read that right, this fighter that everyone claims to be so good and some even call him the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d, has never even defended the two belts that he has held in the UFC. The first time he won a championship belt was in the Featherweight division, when he knocked out Jose Aldo, the previous champion who, prior to that fight, was undefeated for years and had held the title for that duration. He knocked the former champion out in just 13 seconds, with one punch, which I must say is an incredible accolade to hold.  However , after this, he proceeded to move up to the Lightweight division, in which he had  three fights while holding the Featherweight title.  These fights spanned over 14 months, and throughout this duration he held up the entire Featherweight Division as he did not defend his Featherweight title once! Eventually, he was granted a Lightweight title shot, under controversial circumstances. This fight was granted to him after fighting twice at Lightweight, winning once and losing once to the number 5 ranked Lightweight fighter at that time. Despite the controversy he managed to win his fight against Eddie Alvarez via knockout. This meant that Conor McGregor had just become the UFC\u2019s first ever multiple division champion. However,  due to his inactivity in the Featherweight division he was stripped of the Featherweight Title.  As of this date, he is currently taking a break and still has not defended his Lightweight title once! So to summarise, of course he's good, he's a good fighter, promoter and talker. However  he is overrated.  And will continue to be so until he can defend a title inside the octagon. I hope this answers your question. Not a chance! Conor McGregor is an exceptionally talented guy, more so than people want to believe. I think that a good way to sum it up is to look at his fight against Jose Aldo. Aldo was unbeaten in 10 years when he came into the Octagon to fight Conor, virtually no one had been able to touch him in that 10 year span. Aldo has one of the most advanced and technically sound fighting styles in the UFC, and this was a cause for concern for a lot of UFC fans. McGregor did this \u2026 13 second K.O Conor was coming into the Octagon against a guy who was supposedly unbeatable, who had done it all and who had one of the longest title reigns that the UFC has ever seen, and McGregor caught him  perfectly , within seconds of the very first round. Overrated? Absolutely not. \u201cPrecision beats power and timing beats speed\u201d - Conor McGregor",

Australia Considering Global Fire Power Ranking of different countries: \u200b Considering this list and the friends and enemies of India and China, we can say that there will be next World War and China will get defeated (most probably). Is Russia more likely to side with China or India in the event of a war? Who would win in a war between China and Russia? How would a war between the US and China play out? If there is war between India and China and if India wins, will that lead to Tibet's freedom? Who would win a war between NATO and some of its allies versus the rest of the world including India, Russia, China etc.? Firstly, it is a highly improbable event; for the sake of question, it will certainly depend upon the role of USA and Russia, whom they'll support. But, I can definitely say, that: Winner - Arms manufacturers and exporters. Loser - Innocent citizens. Let me just say it , nobody is actually going to win and nobody is actually going to loose. Governments on both sides are sensible enough to abstain from such an idea. \u00a0Any war between these two countries will leave massive causalities on both sides ,leaving aside the massive infrastructure and economy loss and many other ramifications aside. Both countries are the flag bearers of\u00a0 Asia's\u00a0 road to become a world power . \u00a0Unlike 1965 , India has come a long way in upgrading its defense strength on all 3 frontiers namely land,air,sea and today's news that the government has given its nod for mega defense deals , allowing 6 submarines to built in India under \"Make In India\" movement and not to forget huge military import from the US ( around 10 billion $). It is suffice to say that the Indian defense is fully capable to respond and cause significant damage to any enemy . Thought if you do the math , China spends a major portion its budget on defense much more\u00a0 in comparison to India in terms of number of indigenous missiles ,arms etc but China government would be acting naive in using this theory as sole basis to plan an attack of India (Not forgetting allies like Russia and many more logical reasons). It can be concluded that both China and India have a lot to give each other rather than fighting over petty issues which are at-best resolvable. The recent visit of\u00a0 Chinese President Xi Jinping is a testimony to that. Given the nuclear status of both the nations and India's entry into the Inter Continental Ballistic Missile club with the  Agni-V  which puts most major Chinese cities in strike range, a full scale war with the Chinese is rather unlikely. Unlike Pakistan, China has much to lose from such a war, both monetarily as well as morally. Having said that there's one theory that scares me. Suppose China breaches the NEFA and enters Arunachal or occupies a part of the territory, how will India react? Given India's 'No First Use' policy the Chinese will know we aren't daft enough to resort to nuclear strike immediately, besides it wouldn't make sense to expose the entire Indian population to nuclear reciprocation from China for one state or a part of it.  In such a scenario it will be an old fashioned war fought between conventional forces which would be really interesting. The Chinese have a huge army and state of art artillery besides an extensive roadways to replenish itself, unlike the Indian side which has shockingly still not developed infrastructure along the NEFA.\u00a0 Plus the Chinese can push the Pakistanis to open a second front on the West thus increasing pressure on India.  The Chinese will obviously try to annex as much territory in as short a time as possible as it cannot risk a US intervention. It may be a repeat of 1962 with China annexing some part of the territory followed by a threat of nuclear holocaust for entire India in case we try a counter attack. Of necessity we will be pushed to the negotiating table and that would mean losing territory and our face. It's just a theory based on a very layman knowledge and I can be absolutely wrong but it's scary.",

        "a": "A2A:  Why are years before Christ (B.C.) counted backwards? The earth is around 4.5 billion years old, but we do not know the exact age. Scientists and historians needed a date as a reference point from which to calculate the passing of time/years and since the system was devised in Europe, they went with the birth of Christ as the \u20180\u2019 point and the years progressed from there to the present. For the years that came before that, they progressed in the negative, which is how most scales are used, like for pressure, temperature, elevation and depression etc. What happens to the years between \"B.C.\" and \"A.D.\"? How to refer to the time when Christ was alive? When counting years, most of us consider the birth of Christ to be year 0. But how were years counted before that time? Do atheists believe in a time called B.C.? How is the birth of Jesus Christ used as a reference point to count years? What do B.C. ( Before Christ ) and A.D. ( Anno Domini ) refer to? The AD/BC system counts years before or after some point in time (around 2017 years ago) - the more years before that point, the higher the number of years \u201cBC\u201d, and the more years after that point, the larger the year \u201cAD\u201d. Is this a joke question? Assume the year Jesus was born was \u201cyear 0\u201d. How else could we count those years before the birth except by counting backwards? Think of a thermometer\u2026zero degrees is just a start of measurement of heat or cold. Anything below zero degrees is minus one, minus two, and so on. The same idea or principle applies to numbering years before Jesus' birth. Hope that helps. Because its a retrospective calendar with the start point at year 1 of the Gregorian calendar and must therefore count backwards in order to make any sense, just like negative numbers. The earlier calendars are meaningless without a suitable reference point and BCE 1 has been used for that purpose. If we didn\u2019t put a peg in the ground, we would be in something like year 4,700,002,017. That\u2019s why we count backwards from BC.",

        "a": "There\u2019s actually a good bit of uniformity of scholars (theist and atheist) on Biblical authorship. A starting point for the interested is  Authorship of the Bible - Wikipedia As to \u201cwhy,\u201d that of course turns on any number of factors, and there is no \u201catheistic\u201d view on the subject. The only commonality of atheists is the disbelief in gods. This atheist believes that the Bible fits into many traditions of various myths, fables, folklore, tradition, and cultural rules. Parts of these were collected at various times, and then edited to become one of the many versions of the Bible known today. There are numerous reasons for myths, fables, and folklore. But at the moment I rather like something I saw in  The Guardian: The real reason creation myths are near universal was given by the Scottish philosopher David Hume. Hume observed that without an idea of cause and effect, we would be utterly incapable of making sense of the world around us. The problem, however, is that all we observe is one darn thing after another: we never actually see one thing causing something else. Nor do we have sound rational reasons for leaping from observations of regularity to the conclusion that two things are linked by some necessary connection. Fortunately, nature has bridged this logical and empirical gap for us. The idea of a necessary connection between events is something the mind imposes on its perceptions. But because this is a deep-rooted and automatic instinct, we tend to think that the causal links have in fact been observed, not imposed by our minds. Because our minds are thus busy imposing a causal order on our perceptions, we often end up seeing causes where there are none. For instance, we touch a lucky bunny before we buy our lottery tickets and if we win, we attribute the victory to the rabbit. It is as though we are causation-greedy, preferring a bad explanation to none at all. So we naturally ask where the universe comes from, and in the absence of any reliable way of discovering the real answers, we make a best guess, which usually means describing cosmic creation in ways analogous to more familiar forms, such as a birth or the act of a purposive inventor. Source:  Why do we have creation myths? Where do atheists believe the Bible came from? For an atheist, is the Bible a good read? What would an atheistic Bible look like? According to atheists, what happens after death? From an atheistic point of view, why is murder wrong? It doesn\u2019t really matter. Sure, we (people, not atheists specifically) know that some sections were written by educated Greeks. Other parts were written in Hebrew and Aramaic. We know the original apostles were, by their own accounts, illiterate. The text was not written at the time of the events described, but many years later. We know the authors of Matthew and Luke used very similar material, from a common Q document or oral tradition, but the author of Mark does not. Text forensics show there were many edits over time, line after line, by churchmen and scribes, in addition to several major revisions by committee. Tests also indicate there is more than one \u201cJohn\u201d writing in this document. Wikipedia has, not an article, but a category full of articles on the topic: Category:Biblical authorship debates - Wikipedia But none of that really matters. Those are just the details of an old book. The important part is, the Bible makes claims for a god and avatars of God, miracles, divine rules and fantastical events. I find those things unbelievable. Though I was indoctrinated as a child, my beliefs fell away as I grew up, like beliefs in other things we were told were true, like Santa Claus, tooth faeries, boogeymen, angels, devils, ghosts and all the rest. We sometimes hear from Christians or Muslims, atheists must become scholars of our sacred text. No, we don\u2019t. In a free market of ideas, a belief system has to promote itself and compete with other ideas. I have no debt or duty to any religion. I don\u2019t have to study it, respect it, follow the rules in it or care anything about it. Unless it earns respect and deserves its laurels. So far, none appears to. Well there is no \u201catheistic\u201d point of view so there\u2019s no way to properly answer your question. I can, however, give my personal point of view as an atheist. By whom? No idea to be honest. There are scholars that might have discovered who wrote certain parts(Paul as an example) and they could also have figured out around which time those pieces were written. I do know that it wasn\u2019t just one, single person though. Most religious books are probably a collection of texts from various sources. I\u2019m not too clued up on the Torah entirely but the old testament of the christian Bible is basically the Torah(Traditionally said to have been written mostly by Moses but further analysis indicated that it was multiple authors). How? It could have been on scrolls of papyrus or clay tablets and using a galam(apparently made from reeds - middle east). From there it\u2019s just a matter of fitting them all together as a book. Why? Dear lord now this can be one of a million things depending on who you ask\u2026 Personally I think it\u2019s a mix of preservation of culture, a guide for society to follow for various issues(old testament - not eating pork is most likely due to possible health issues) aka lessening the effect of natural selection, a way to explain, albeit badly, things that we either don\u2019t know or don\u2019t understand and of course political power. You know what they say: \u201creligion is the opium of the masses\u201d. Original Question: From an atheistic point of view, why and how the Bible was written and by who? Why from an atheistic point of view? Regardless of what perspective you have makes no difference to the  facts  about the real authorship of the Bible. Having said that, many Christians will tell you that the Bible is the word of God or was written by God, and when pressed as to how they know this, they\u2019ll cite the Bible itself as \u2018evidence\u2019. This is of course one great fallacy, that of Begging the Question, also knows as the fallacy of Circular Reasoning, or Petitio Principii, which is a fallacy in which the premises include the claim that the conclusion is true or (directly or indirectly) assume that the conclusion is true. A good example of this which involves this claim that the Bible was written by God, goes along the lines of: Bill: \"God must exist.\"  Jill: \"How do you know.\"  Bill: \"Because the Bible says so.\"  Jill: \"Why should I believe the Bible?\"  Bill: \"Because the Bible was written by God.\" In other words there\u2019s no external reference to the claim, and it just goes round in a circle. In reality however, the Bible has multiple authors, the vast majority of whom are completely unknown. It\u2019s a compilation of individual documents which reflect the views and beliefs of the various groups of people at the time of writing, and many of the stories in the Bible are either entirely fictitious (only 53 of the many characters mentioned in the Bible have any non-biblical authentication) or are myths which had a symbolic meaning at the time, and which are often based on stories plagiarised from older cultures. As an example of this, the entire first 5 books of the Old Testament, including Genesis and Exodus, are complete fabrications written by unknown scribes during the time of the Babylonian Exile, and variously draw on much earlier mythological stories from Mesopotamia and Egypt, such as the Akkadian \u201c Sargon of Akkad \u201d, the Sumerian \u201c Epic of Gilgamesh \u201d and the Egyptian \u201c Book of the Dead \u201d. As far as the New Testament is concerned, there\u2019s only one author who is known for sure, and that\u2019s Paul, to whom 13 out of the 27 books are ascribed, although it\u2019s suspected that half of these are later works which simply bear his name in order to give them added authenticity. The four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were also written completely anonymously, the the names given to them were also slightly later attempts at making their allegorical - fictitious but conveying a spiritual or moral message - content appear more authoritative. As to why the Bible was written, or rather, why the individual books were written, it was largely to either put down the spiritual beliefs of the people of the time, which had previously been passed on by word of mouth, or to give a false history which enabled supposed prophecies to have been fulfilled. In the case of Genesis, Exodus etc., they were written to give the scattered and disheartened Judahites caught up in the Babylonian Exile, a sense of common belonging. The New Testament in its entirely was written in order to promote the new religion of Christianity, and large parts of it, including the gospels, were written using a literary technique called midrash. This took Old Testament \u2018miracles\u2019, with which the people of the time would have been very familiar, and updated them and ascribed them to Jesus (whoever he was, there are  no  historical records whatsoever) in order to make him appear more important and powerful than the Old Testament characters the Jews still worshipped. Sales and marketing material for the new religion basically. \u201cFrom an atheistic point of view, why and how the Bible was written and by who?\u201d Firstly, it\u2019s important to recognize that atheists aren\u2019t the opposite of Christians. While some atheists were former Christians, or people raised in Christian environments/traditions, a great many were not, and those who weren\u2019t hold Christianity in no particular regard whatsoever, nor its religious texts. As an extension of this \u2014 this question is just as appropriate to ask of any other non-Christian as it is to atheists. Anyway, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to speak for atheists as any sort of unified group, so I\u2019ll speak for myself (though I imagine I wouldn\u2019t be alone in this view). The Bible was written for the same basic reasons that all religious texts are written \u2014 enough people believed in something that they were becoming a cohesive group, and wanted to get all on the same page about doctrine, teachings, stories, etc. The people most likely to have put this all together would have been those were (at least nominal) leaders of those believers. In terms of \u201chow\u201d, this is an extensively studied bit of historical record, on which non-Christians and Christians are basically in agreement (because that\u2019s how history works). In terms of who actually wrote it, that\u2019s a tiny bit less firmly historical because some of the \u201csource material\u201d comes predominantly from the Bible itself, but enough of it is externally verifiable that there isn\u2019t a ton of disagreement between Christians and non-Christians on that either.",

        "a": "Often a powerful image is simple. The background is uncluttered. What you consider meaningful and glamorous others may see as a distraction. Georgia O\u2019keeffe. Photo by Alfred Stieglitz. Photo is from Wikipedia. Now O\u2019Keeffe was a famous painter, but this simple photo has no \u201cbling\u201d. It\u2019s expressive, soulful, and simple. Her paintings were very sensual, and the photo mirrors that powerful sensuality, but in a subdued way. What are the photos that made everyone in India cry? How do people lock their profile picture on Facebook so no one can like or comment, just view? How can you find out someone's name from a picture? Do people see me like a picture on Facebook feed if I unlike that picture right away? Is there a way to find the most liked picture on Facebook? If so, what is the most liked picture? I would say it\u2019s because most people aren\u2019t glamorous nor do they feel they do much in the way of meaningful activity. If they did they wouldn\u2019t be spending so much of their free time on FB. So, in that respect, seeing glamorous people doing meaningful things is difficult for them to take and as such they tend to gravitate to the ones who\u2019s lives are more in line with their own. Also include the belief that they don\u2019t find very much pleasure in seeing people with material things they can\u2019t afford. Why do people like common pictures as opposed to glamorous or more meaningful pictures on Facebook? People like reality. \u201cGlamorous\u201d photos aren\u2019t relatable, and people are  banner blind  to them. if I post a normal picture of me, perhaps a selfie or portrait, I get soo many likes, as opposed to when I portray myself as doing something interesting. Perhaps what you consider interesting isn\u2019t the same as what your followers consider interesting. Perhaps they\u2019re not following you because they like the same things as you. It could be interesting to try to work out what it is that they like - why they follow you - and then either play it up or start ignoring them. Maybe they\u2019re not friend material. I got very few likes on my new SUV That\u2019s probably because you\u2019re showing off and nobody likes a show-off people have seen SUVs before \u201cCommon\u201d pictures, as you put it, are often much more intimate than semi-professional photo sets. I don\u2019t care what car you have. A million other people have the same one, in the same colour. Unless the picture is showing something interesting or unique about it, it\u2019s page filler, and what the masses like doesn\u2019t have to line up with what you like. It doesn\u2019t have to mean your pictures or other content isn\u2019t good. i suppose that simple photos links more attention because people want to be updated as fast as they can red the news and multitask during another task or surfing the web a more ditailed picture takes time to understand whats in there and most of the people who use Facebook dont have the time to realize",

        "a": "Storyboard are used to design the UI of the application in xcode. They provide a single place for all the UI. This helps the developer to visualise the entire flow of the app. You can create multiple storyboards and link them. Earlier with xib or nibs we had to design each UI separately and then link them by code but with storyboards this can be done with the help of few clicks only. Exerpts from Apple\u2019s official documentation - A storyboard is a visual representation of the user interface of an iOS application, showing screens of content and the connections between those screens. A storyboard is composed of a sequence of scenes, each of which represents a view controller and its views; scenes are connected by segue objects, which represent a transition between two view controllers. You can read more about it here -  Storyboard How do I go back to the normal storyboard in Xcode 8? How do you work with storyboards on a large team? Why do I need to use an Xcode's storyboard if I could build a tab bar without it? Precisely, what is the relation of a storyline to a storyboard? Do you use Storyboard for your Swift projects? A storyboard is a visual representation of the user interface of an iOS application, showing screens of content and the connections between those screens. A storyboard is composed of a sequence of scenes, each of which represents a view controller and its views; scenes are connected by segue objects, which represent a transition between two view controllers. Xcode provides a visual editor for storyboards, where you can lay out and design the user interface of your application by adding views such as buttons, table views, and text views onto scenes. In addition, a storyboard enables you to connect a view to its controller object, and to manage the transfer of data between view controllers. Using storyboards is the recommended way to design the user interface of your application because they enable you to visualize the appearance and flow of your user interface on one canvas. A Scene Corresponds to a Single View Controller and Its Views On iPhone, each scene corresponds to a full screen\u2019s worth of content; on iPad, multiple scenes can appear on screen at once\u2014for example, using popover view controllers. Each scene has a dock, which displays icons representing the top-level objects of the scene. The dock is used primarily to make action and outlet connections between the view controller and its views. As with all objects loaded from a story board, to finish initializing a view controller loaded from a storyboard you override  awakeFromNib . A Segue Manages the Transition Between Two Scenes You can set the type of transition (for example, modal or push) on a segue. Additionally, you can subclass a segue object to implement a custom transition. You can pass data between scenes with the method  prepareForSegue:sender: , which is invoked on the view controller when a segue is triggered. This method allows you to customize the setup of the next view controller before it appears on the screen. Transitions usually occur as the result of some event, such as a button being tapped, but you can programmatically force a transition by calling  performSegueWithIdentifier:sender:  on the view controller. Story board is a component in Xcode, where developer can place user interface objects in one file. From storyboard, developer can understand entire UI flow . It improves readability and understanding of an app. Developer can use different storyboards for iPad and iPhone in a single universal app. If dev wants to change entire UI flow, then he can place new storyboard instead of old one(it's not easy as just replace but 200% easier than old method). In short, from a storyboard, developer can read the story of an app and can easily manage entire UI rather than managing different user interface files in one app). Excuse my English",

For example, what is the probability of drawing exactly 3 aces in the first 5 draws? The probability the first three are aces is 4/52*3/51*2/50*48/49*47/48. This used the rule for multiplying conditional probabilities. You need to add the probabilities that three aces occur in other positions among the first 5 draws. If you think about it the denominators are all the same, and the numerators just occur in a different order. So multiply this result by the number of positions the three aces can appear in, i.e. 10.

After 500 Km, ride at following speeds till you reach 2000 Km, I would recommend till 5000 Km since long stroke engines are not meant to be over-revved too much. 0 to 20 Kmph: 1st gear 21 to 30Kmph: 2nd gear 31 to 40 Kmph: 3rd gear 41 to 55 Kmph: 4th gear 56 to 70 Kmph: 5th gear If you follow above gear-speed chart, you will definitely get 40 to 45 Kmpl mileage for a long time. This is from my experience with my electra 350. Also, it is recommended to fill her up with Shell V-Power petrol every 2 to 3 months so that the engine gets cleaned up by the cleaning additives in the fuel. No it's false. However take it easy for the first few thousand kilometres and try not to Rev the engine a lot. Keep riding at caring rpms. Infact ride like this all the time. It's safer for you as a rider and keeps the engine happy as well. I ride a 350 TB AVL, which I bought back in 2003. The real truth is royal Enfield engine tolerances are higher than other japanese and western brands so drive your re smoothly throughout its lifespan you will get good economy otherwise there will thermal loss , combustion loss due to shaving of piston rings and bore . So re are made for low throttle rides enjoy it smoothly don't rip it hard you will enjoy it for years to come.",

        "a": "The popular belief is that one year of a dog\u2019s life would equal 7 human years. However, because dogs actually mature much quicker than adults, this is not the case. Generally speaking, the first year of a dog\u2019s life equals to about 15 human years. However, the second year of a dog\u2019s life would only be around 9 human years. The third year would only be 5 years. After that, every year of the dog\u2019s life would equal to 5 human years. It is worth noting that generally the smaller the breed the longer its lifespan, but smaller dogs also tend to mature quicker in the first few years of their lives than larger dog breeds. Hope this helps If I leave my one-year-old dog with a friend for about 10 months, will he remember me when I come back? Are dogs better than humans? How many times a year can a dog have pups? How many years does a dog live? If your dog killed your 2 year old child, would you kill the dog? That varies with each breed. Giant breeds like the Great Dane average 7 years to their lifetime while a small breed like a Yorkie or a dachshund can go to 18 years on average. Some mixed breeds have made it to 25 years. The first two years can be equivalent to 24 of our years. With most breeds it slows down after that. So it also depends on what phase your referring to.",

If the domain would be registered before then there would not be this question of kill switch only. Also this kill switch was kept by the original creators of WannaCry ransomware to be on the safer side so that they can stop this ransomware if by any chance they are infected or for any other good reason. Even we can see this thing from movies that even the bad person who make something to destroy the world always make a koll switch so that they can stop it if ever something goes wrong. I think this might be the reason they kept a kill switch in the first place. Can I use the word \u2018hello\u2019 in a domain name? For example, if I want to register a domain name like helloreaders.com, is it acceptable? I used a fake name to register a domain. How can I change it back? How to register a domain name in WHMCS ? How can I register a domain name in Google? How do I register .ER domain? Then why bother even coding in a \u2018kill switch\u2019? The code was checking against a static IP so that it could be stopped if need be, or more likely as a sandbox evasion tool. As a lot of research into how malware behaves requires the use of analyzing it, malware developers usually will employ anti sandboxing tools to stop the malware showing it\u2019s true form, or terminating immediately when it detects that it is being monitored. In this case, they employed a rather poor tool that simply relied on checking whether an obscure domain was registered, because if it was it gave the impression that the malware was under analysis (VM\u2019s will resolve DNS address\u2019s so that they can watch how the malware responds). Quite simply, when MalwareTech registered the domain, WannaCry believed it was in a global sandbox and A simple \u2018fix\u2019 that the hackers could have employed was using dynamic addresses that were as obscure, but were never identical so that you get a new request with each infection which would make it impossible to predict, and one that would escape certain sandboxes.",

How do I record a high quality audio song with help of this? I think you should use a dynamic mic instead of condenser mic. Dynamic mics are used in concerts and live performances, so they do not catch disturbances so easily. Condenser mics are used for studios and are very good at catching slightest of noise. I assume you are not recording in a studio or sound free zone. So based on that assumption. A dynamic mic. You can choose one depending upon your budget. Shure mics are good. Check this. You will get answers What is the best mic I can buy in India for recording YouTube videos? Whether you want to record indoors or outdoors I would suggest you to go with a condenser mic as they are really good in eliminating the natural sounds that surround you and are amazing at catching both vocals and instruments. Following are some of Condenser Mics at budget. Audio Tecnica AT2020 Blue Snowball iCE Blue Yeti You can pair any of the above Mics with a Focusrite Scarlette 2i2 interface and it would just add to the quality of sound you record.",

        "a": "You said you\u2019re 17 and female. If you\u2019re in the US, you already have two of the three criteria that men and popular culture consider \u201cbeautiful\u201d. You\u2019re young. You\u2019re a woman. The third criterion is \u201cnot fat\u201d. Show the average American guy someone with all three of those criteria, and they\u2019ll likely say she\u2019s beautiful. Look at celebrities that pop culture says are beautiful, and they\u2019ll be: female, not fat, and young, or at least look younger than their age. I am 22 with 135+ IQ, good at martial arts & sports, running my own business, good looking, people respect me for my attitude. How will you se... I always get a lot of people telling me how awesome or amazing I am. But why can't I see it for myself? Why do people tell me I am pretty, even though I disagree? Do Pathans see themselves as the most good looking people in subcontinent? Why or why not? Why do I not believe people when they say I am cute/good looking? I think there are two parts to external beauty. One is your genetics, the other is your physique. Our body\u2019s a sculpture we cultivate, nurture, destroy, neglect, love, caress, scar, strengthen, weaken. When people compliment you on the parts you were born with, it\u2019s difficult to genuinely feel happy about. Most don\u2019t, because they haven\u2019t done anything to earn those features. It\u2019s like complimenting a duck for being a duck. But your body\u2019s different. You can work on it, strengthen it, build it however you\u2019d like. When people compliment you and you fail to feel anything, then it\u2019s because you know  you can do better . You know you\u2019re not doing enough, that you\u2019re yearning for more because more is possible. When it hits you that you\u2019ve worked hard to achieve your external beauty, then compliments will feel a lot more  real  and heartfelt. Also, the realization that there will always be someone prettier than you is ironically as liberating as it gets. There will always be someone better, always. And you can\u2019t do anything about that. But becoming better than you were yesterday is something you can do. And the more you strive to polish your physique and sculpture, the better you\u2019ll feel. It\u2019s a lot of work and definitely easier said than done. A2A\u2019ed. I\u2019m not sure why there is a gentleman who answered saying that there\u2019s three criteria that men consider beautiful as being \u201c young, a woman, and not fat. \u201d It\u2019s grossly incorrect. Please ignore it. You get compliments all the time for being good looking,  probably because you are.  And it isn\u2019t just because you happen to be young, a woman, and \u201cnot fat.\u201d You probably are actually a good looking person. People wouldn\u2019t keep saying it to you if it wasn\u2019t true. There really is no need to seek validation from others that you are pretty, when they\u2019ve given you mountains of evidence that already confirms this fact. Please don\u2019t misunderstand others. They aren\u2019t just saying it. If it happens frequently, then there is probably a reason. I know how self conscious this can make one feel. I hate getting uncalled-for compliments myself, and to me they feel shallow, and ignorant of who I am as a person. I suspect you may feel similarly confused, or irritated by them at times. It\u2019s best to take the compliment, but then realize that  is all it is . A compliment. It doesn\u2019t validate you, or invalidate you as a person. It is just one\u2019s persons perception. Being 17, it can sometimes feel like your appearance is the most important thing, since you just came from (or are still in) a incubator that judges you constantly for your appearance (High School), and it can feel like your appearance is going to be the deciding factor of your success. It truly isn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t be used as the measuring stick of your worth in life. Passions such as your relationships, your career, your hobbies, life experiences. Those things are the real measuring stick of your life, and the more involved you are in those, the less you care about what people think of your appearance. I hope you realize this, and also see the beauty within yourself. This sounds to me like you\u2019re suffering from low self-esteem. You don\u2019t believe people when they tell you that they think you are good looking. You look in the mirror, and you don\u2019t think the person there is attractive. You seek continual validation because of this, because you are worried that if you don\u2019t, then your own personal beliefs will be true. You fix this by actually believing people when they tell you what they see, and working to love the person you see and the person that you are. A2A. As a young female person, you kinda have to be very careful what people\u2019s intentions are when they compliment you. I am certain most of these are just nice people telling you sweetly that you are good looking. However, and trust me because I have been there when younger, bad things can happen when the wrong people think you are attractive. If you are getting \u201cunsolicited compliments\u201d that borderlines lewd, then you definitely should make a note to avoid these people. And btw, from your photo, you have very beautiful skin, eyes and eyebrows, despite the fact that society should not reduce a girl down to just looks. :-/ Best of luck.",

There are server side and client side programming and all have their own niches and markets. Right now programming is in very high demand so depending on your skills making money in programming is very very easy! But it boils down to your skills and willingness to go above and beyond and learn and adapt to the ever-changing environment. API Programming -  If you program in PHP or any web development platforms learn APIs, API coding is very profitable and very sought after. Amazon AWS, Google APIs etc are all very much in demand. Freelance -  You can consider freelance sites such as  Upwork, the world's largest online workplace  which is a higher class site where better clients go.  Freelancer - Hire & Find Jobs  is a total joke, it is full of sub-par freelancers which drown out any potentially good freelancers. They use tools to bid on projects without reading them and it is just a really horrible and bad environment! Social -  You can also post on craigslist, believe it or not you can find some good clients through this avenue. In a large town you might even consider a ad in a newspaper. Facebook and Twitter can also be a source for new clients. Start your own projects -  Contrary to other recommendations I don\u2019t recommend submitting resumes for big companies unless you are extremely skilled, and if you are that skilled you probably can still make better money working for yourself developing your own projects. So that leads me to the last point. I have been spending over $60,000 a year on programming. I found the guy on Craigslist believe it or not. But I have also hired through Upwork successfully. If you try Upwork bid lower on projects at first to get credibility and feedback rating up. Once you got a reputation you can charge full-price and get good clients. Lower is not always better, but when starting out it can be. Can computer programmers make money from home? Is it a difficult process? How can a newbie programmer work from home and make money?

Become a freelancer Becoming a freelancer is one of the easiest ways to earn money on programming while you are at a young age, you go into a website like  freelancer.com ,  elance.com , and many others, and find a project or task that you can do, do it, and get the money, simple as that. Downsides to being a freelancer When I started looking into the freelancing world, I always had a weird fear that I could not do the task, even though I did have all the skills necessary. You might be lucky and do not have this irrational fear, but if you do you will have to overcome it. Freelancing is often not a well-paid job, and in the beginning, you will probably be looking at jobs paying you around 10$ or even less, so if you are looking for something that will make you rich, freelancing is probably not the place to look. You will not have a regular income either, the most of the tasks you will be doing as a young freelancer will be smaller tasks, that will take less than a week, maybe even less than an hour, and you might not even be able to find something that suits you, so freelancing is not a way of getting some kind of regular income neither. But freelancing can be a great way to gain experience while learning to program, and gaining experience is one of the most important things you can do to get a better job in programming. Work on an open source project. While making an open source project will not directly make you any money, there are a couple of ways you can monetize your projects while gaining experience for other future jobs. When we young programmers usually make a project, we dream big about features that could make our projects some of the best products in the world, the problem is just that we cannot do all the things alone, and this is where open source kicks in. Using a platform like Github allows everybody to contribute to your project, which is a good mark for if your project is any good or not. It teaches you how to work with code together with other programmers, which is one of the most important skills when working on big projects. Besides from looking good on your CV, and teaching you some great collaboration skills, you can earn money on open source. You can add a donation form on your project, even though you will probably not earn a fortune, but if you are creating a killer product, you will make some money. But the best thing about it is that you have something to show off to companies, which will make you much more likely to be hired. I have to confess though, I have not worked that much on open source projects, and I feel ashamed by it, but I hope that telling you it through this blog post will make me work harder for it, so that I have something I can really show off, and so that I will be able to get better at collaboration, which is a skill that I am working really hard to improve. Make an app As I have described in an earlier blog post,  I have begun on making an Android App  , I will not go that much in detail about it, but making an app is a relatively easy thing to do, and can be a quick way to earn money (using advertising, or in-app purchases), as well as having something to show of to companies. One thing, though, there is a big difference in making an app for Android and an app for iOS, and that is the fact that making an app for Google Play costs just 25$ one-off, making an app for iOS costs 99$ a year, so if you are making an app for iOS, I will recommend you to be a bit more confident about the way you will make money by your app, than if you are making an app for Android. Make a plugin or theme for WordPress This is a great way to make some money. You can do it yourself, or you could work together with some other people (please feel free to tell in the comments if you are looking for a partner for a project), and you can make almost anything you would like to, anything from a donation plugin to a share button, to a Star Wars theme (alright I am not sure about the copyrights on the last one, but you know what I mean\u2026). You can choose to make it free, and earn the money through advertising or donations, or make it premium and get the money directly, it is all up to you. Treehouse , and  Alecaddd  are the best places I have seen on WordPress development. The downside? It tends to get all too complicated all to quick, but that is just what happens when something is having so many users as WordPress (one-quarter of all websites in the world). But the documentation provided by WordPress is great, so you will not have to search around Stack Overflow all day long to find your answers. Cheers :-) You are in a great place to work from home! Programming is a specialized, high paying skill that can be performed from anywhere. Therefore you have a few options. Check the job listings for programmers on the Flex Jobs website,  Telecommuting Jobs & Professional Part-Time Jobs Check the job listings for programmers on Rat Race Rebellion\u2019s website,  Home - Real Work From Home Jobs by Rat Race Rebellion Pick out 10\u201325 companies that you would love to work for and you know hire programmers. If they have openings for programmers, find out the name of the Director of the Programming department and write an introduction letter. In that letter outline all of your skills and pitch the idea that you would love to work for them from home. I have a friend who is a CAD person who had to move away from his job due to family issues. He pitched the idea to the company he worked for and now he still works for them from his new city. The last is not for the faint of heart. Go into business for yourself as a programmer for hire or programming consultant! I hope you find the work at home opportunity that is PERFECT for you!",

Update:\u2014  \u2018Waint\u2019 is listed in Wiktionary,  Yourdictionary.com , and the printed  Websters New World Dictionary of American English, Third Collegiate Edition  (1988). What is the difference between the usage of don't and do not? What is the difference between the usage of don't and not? Grammatically, which sentence is correct, \"I didn't know\" or \"I didn't knew\"? What is the difference between don`t have and haven`t? What is the difference between these two sentences - \u201cHe said he is hungry\u201d and \u201cHe said he was hungry\u201d? Which one is grammatically correct? Neither Wikipedia, Merrill-Webster, or  Dictionary.com  lists \u201cwaint\u201d as a word. The two references I could find were in the lyrics of a rap song (this was apparently a misspelling of the word \u201cwait\u201d on Wikipedia\u2019s part), and used colloquially in rural areas in Lancashire, where it seems to mean \u201cwon\u2019t.\u201d Oh, and there was one instance where \u201cwaint\u201d was quite obviously a misspelling of \u201cwant.\u201d All of this to say that I really can\u2019t answer your question, because the word \u201cwaint\u201d doesn\u2019t really exist except in a colloquial sense in a very small part of the UK, and when it is used it means \u201cwon\u2019t,\u201d not \u201cwasn\u2019t.\u201d So, use the simple word \u201cwasn\u2019t.\u201d It will be readily understood, and unless you\u2019re trying to write or speak colloquially then leave \u201cwaint\u201d alone. (As always, this is only what  I  was able to find. Another person with more resources or education might have a better, clearer answer.) \u201cWasn\u2019t\u201d is a contraction in standard English of \u201cwas not\u201d. \u201cWaint\u201d is a phonetic spelling of a Yorkshire (England) dialect word meaning \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d, or \u201cwouldn\u2019t\u201d. You would use \u201cwasn\u2019t\u201d in normal English speaking and writing. You would never have an occasion to use \u201cwaint\u201d unless perhaps you were writing a novel in which you were trying to replicate the speech of a rural Yorkshire man or woman, in a manner similar to how D.H. Lawrence had the character of the gamekeeper Oliver Mellors speak (although that was in a Derbyshire, not Yorksire accent) in Lawrence\u2019s famous novel,  Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover. In formal circles, waint isn't a word any more than ain\u2019t. However the latter is commonly used in England, and probably elsewhere, to mean am not, is not or are not so it's quite possible that wain\u2019t was used as the past tense. But I've never heard it or seen it written.",

White people, if they wanted, could easily take out 10 percent of the population if they went to war. Worldwide, white majority countries have more military power, and would likely wipe the floor with black majority countries. But any white people not in a white-majority country will probably die or be enslaved. Hopefully it will never come to that, because I prefer living mostly peacefully side by side. More peace would be preferable, thank you. Is the claim that the ancient Egyptians were black (had dark skin) supported by history? If not, what race were they, and how do we know? Who would win if the world went to war by race? Do you get paid for being a white or a black or any other race? What is race? Are \"white\" and \"black\" races? Why do we consider bi-racial people as still being black? For instance why do we regard Obama as black even though his mother is white? Not that one should be necessary, but if so, it would likely be white people since they have most of the money and weapons. On a smaller scale hand to hand, we'd beat the brakes off. Lol No one. Because, war only breeds death, destruction, and despair. There are lives lost, loved ones lose family members, and structures once stood have now fallen. Not to mention, the retaliation of those who would not quit until they avenged those who killed their family members. Also, the individuals who refuse to participate in a racially trivial fight, they would probably be considered traitors and killed in the process. No-one, whites have throughout history dominated in technology but it is not because of individual ability but because of drve and motivation. Whites in general do not feel limited and will literally do anything to achieve their goal. Though if you go back far enough, we were all black and from Africa, we did adapt and change to best thrive and survive in out new environments we immigrated to, we are all basically the same outside of these adaptations. The only real thing I see separating whites from all others is this drive or motivation for more. Whites in general are never satisfied and do not let tradition, religion, the past or anything stop them from acquiring or achieving more. If it meant destroying every living thing on earth, I have no doubt whites would to achieve their goal. Fear of death has never been an obsticle for whites, the thrill of cheating death is merely another motivating factor. No other group of living things on this earth gets so much satisfaction from facing death, you can not truly win a war when this part of the equation and they have the technology to end all life. No one wins, everyone looses unless you welcome death in which case I guess you do win. It all just depends on where on the planet it may happen, though, more than likely it will be whites to win. Though there are more blacks in the world than whites. whites have the military power and the technology and could probably wipe out all of Africa, Plus the rest of the world if they wanted to, they run the world don't ya know?",

Now with reference to your specific situation, the breast tissue growth you are experiencing is a natural phenomenon that happens because this is a time when there is huge hormonal (male - female) fluctuations happening in your body. For some like you, there will be a temporary increase in female hormones and that is causing breast tissue growth. This should go away by the time you are out of adolescence or around 18\u201319 years. Again, this is natural and in normal circumstances, you do not need to do anything. Once you enter adulthood, your chest will flatten out and you will be perfectly fine. Take a look at this dedicated page on my site for teenagers with gynecomastia.

        "a": "Creating wealth is not easy and it is a lot of hard work. Everyone suggesting otherwise is either drunk or a scammer. HOWEVER, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t create wealth and become rich while you\u2019re young. You can actually do it in a few years. I know, because I\u2019m doing it. Real wealth creation can be split into 4 different steps: 1. Massive income The first step of wealth creation is to create  massive income. There\u2019s only 2 ways to do that: Be 100%, or close to 100%, commission based. Start a business There\u2019s no way around the fact that we have to start with our income, before we can create real wealth. 2. Create multiple flows of income When we\u2019ve created a strong income stream, we have to use that money to create an additional income stream. We can do this through starting another business, or through taking a second job. Regardless of how we do it, we just have to create multiple streams of income without losing the first one. When it comes to creating multiple flows of income, there\u2019s 3 things, that EVERY additional income stream MUST have: Control. You must be able to control your income. This means that you have to be commission-based or own the business yourself. Don\u2019t let others control how much you make. Scalability. How much can your income stream make? If it\u2019s not scalable, it\u2019s not the right income stream. It will not make you wealthy. Time-detachment. Your income stream needs to someday be passive, or at least close to passive. If you keep generating income streams and they aren\u2019t passive, you\u2019ll overwhelm yourself. Make sure your income stream is or can become passive income. 3. Stay broke and save When we start making a lot of money with all our strong passive income flows, it can be tempting to buy the nice cars or the expensive apartment. However, if we really want to create wealth, we have to \u2018\u2019stay broke\u2019\u2019 and save our money. This means we still have to spend as little as possible. Keep in mind, if you sacrifice some materialistic pleasures today, you\u2019ll be able to buy all of them in the future. If you stay broke, and you keep saving as much as you can, even though you\u2019re producing a lot of income, you\u2019ll be able to: 4. Invest When you have a lot of money saved up, it\u2019s time to invest. By investing properly, you can multiply your money. This means that your money will grow on itself. I can\u2019t go that deep into investing here, though, cause it\u2019s a very big topic. Conclusion Now, wealth is not easy and it requires a lot of work. However, if you follow this 4-step wealth creation formula, you can definitely get rich\u2026 and you can do it soon. Now, I understand I didn\u2019t go very deep into each step and you might still wonder how to get started. If you\u2019re really serious about getting rich at a young age, I recommend joining  our Facebook group. The group is called  Cure Mediocrity   and it\u2019s a community full of young, ambitious people who are committed to success and wealth at a young age. So, if you\u2019re serious about wealth, success, and living the world-class lifestyle at a young age, and you\u2019re ready to put in the work, I suggest you  join our community on Facebook. I'm 30 and homeless. What is the fastest way for me to become a millionaire? What are some good strategies to become wealthy? How do I get rich in 5 years? What is the weirdest way someone has become a millionaire? Which industries offer the most opportunities for people under 30 to become very wealthy? One of the people I know, which almost 10 years ago (yes, I\u2019m old even though I\u2019m only 30), became what you define \u201cwealthy\u201d in 7 years. And he started at 21, so that makes Mark a \u201cwealthy under 30\u201d, right? Mark did not finish high school and dropped out at the age of 13. After repeating two classes! I always thought that Mark was intelligent in his own way, even though he did not appreciate reading books, watching movies, going for a hiking weekend. He is not the kind with whom you\u2019d have a deep philosophical conversation. But Mark had, and currently has, a strong ability:  he really knows how to sell anything to you. Mark started at 15 years old as a bartender for a chalet on the seaside. He learned how to speak to people, how to make them laugh and, most importantly, he learned how to network. After attending a bar tending course, he applied for a job in a very nice hotel where he knew that managers, executives and many other important people were staying when travelling. There he started working for his success. He knew an executive that asked Mark if he wanted to join his sales department to become a salesman. Mark replied that he did not know how to sell. The executive replied that he could learn, he could join his team for an apprenticeship, with the minimum wage but with commissions. The first year -  in Mark\u2019s words, has been hell. He didn\u2019t learn how to sell to businesses. He got only 10 commissions that year, when the average salesman got, at least 70 commissions. The second year  - Mark and other three salesman got their first big client for a 3 million contract. Client burst up and didn\u2019t pay a dime to them. The third year  - Mark started going out on his own, meeting his own clients (it was a B2B business) and got 50 sales that year. From the third year on  - Mark got 90\u2013120 sales per year and became the top salesman. In those last three years (until 2017) he earned 427\u2032000 euros in commissions only. Only. Commissions. It seems that you want to know how did he do that. Let me explain. He attended 6 sales courses. For the first two years he worked 10 hours per day. He began to read books on how to prospect, how to negotiate and how to close a sale. That\u2019s it. Hard work, planning, executing. Here\u2019s the minimalist approach to sales. The easiest thing you can do is to start buying Bitcoins. Bitcoin has gone up 100% within the last 3 months ($2,400 May 2017) and set to reach $500,000 by 2030. Simply accumulating 2 Bitcoin now can get you there in 13 years. But of course the more you can accumulate, the faster you can become a millionaire and/or wealthy. Take a look at this post:  How to Profit From Bitcoin | Buying and Selling  i Good Luck. Here\u2019s Grant\u2026 It\u2019s no secret that online courses are hot right now. Just about everyone in the online business space either has one or will be launching one in the near future. They\u2019re everywhere. There are plenty of factors that make courses a very appealing choice for online entrepreneurs\u2026 Huge profit margins Create once, sell hundreds (or thousands) of times Little to no overhead cost (completely digital) Very scalable The list goes on and on. So like you, I wanted to be in the course game. In May 2014, I launched my podcast called  How Did You Get Into That?  where we interviewed people doing interesting and unique work. We\u2019ve interviewed a huge variety of different types of careers and naturally attracted an audience of people seeking out work they could be more passionate about. In my Free Training \u201c30 Days to Affiliate Marketing Success\u201d I go into way more detail about how I started earning a living from affiliate marketing with my strategy. If you are interested in making a living from your own online business I highly recommend checking it out. Almost every day I got emails from people looking for career advice and wondering how to find careers or businesses they actually cared about. After enough of these emails and questions, I experienced what most entrepreneurs feel on a regular basis\u2026 A lightbulb moment. Why not create a course for this audience to help them find and discover the career that was right for them? It literally seemed like a no-brainer. I got a test group of about 20 people to each pay $197 which validated the concept for me. At that point, it was all systems go. Over the next several months, I worked with this test group to build and create a course that would scratch their itch (more on the validation part in a minute). Eventually, I was ready to finally open the doors to the public and launch my first course. On December 8, I opened the cart and sat back and waited. And waited. And waited some more. (insert crickets) More awkward silence. It was painful. I legitimately thought we would sell tens of thousands of dollars of this puppy, and it just flat out didn\u2019t happen. Granted, it wasn\u2019t a complete flop, but it just certainly wasn\u2019t what I hoped it would be. We did still sell $8,486 worth of the course and have received a lot of great feedback from members of the course, so I\u2019ll count that as a win. So after a few days of feeling depressed, sorry for myself, and receiving numerous calls from my concerned mother, I realized I needed to figure out what went wrong. In a bit of irony, I think the title Clarity Course leaves it a bit unclear as to what the product is and who it is for. When people would ask who the course was for, I\u2019d say, \u201cIt\u2019s for people who don\u2019t love or hate their job but aren\u2019t really sure what they\u2019d rather be doing.\u201d Unfortunately, that applies to a high percentage of people. The less clear you are about who your product or service is for, the worse it will sell. If you say your product/service is for everyone, it\u2019s really for no one. The bottom line was I knew Clarity Course could be good with some more work, but I had another pesky lightbulb moment I wanted to pursue\u2026 For the past 8 years, I\u2019ve largely made my career as a full-time professional speaker. I\u2019ve traveled all over speaking at conferences, conventions, and other events. I\u2019ve had a pretty decent career as a speaker\u2026 $1.3 million\u2014earnings from speaking 400+\u2014 paid speaking engagements (67 paid engagements last year) 700+\u2014presentations given 45\u2014US states spoken in 350k\u2014 people spoken to live 13,000\u2014biggest audience 30,000+\u2014physical copies sold of my self-published book So naturally because of this, I\u2019ve had a lot of people over the years ask me how to get started as a speaker. There are plenty of people who would love to speak full-time and many others who would love to speak a few times each year in their niche/industry. But how to get speaking engagements has always remained this mysterious puzzle that many people wonder about. After doing this for a while, I knew I had learned a few things about how to get booked and paid to speak that I thought I could teach others. (you see where this is going don\u2019t you? ) Alright, so I wanted to try a course on this subject, but I immediately had the doubts and fears creeping back in my head\u2026 What if this is a flop like Clarity Course was? I knew I had some knowledge on the speaking business, so I decided to give this course thing another shot. On January 1st, I wrote down this goal\u2026 Build and launch speaking course in Q1. It felt aggressive, but do-able. I had 90 days to create a course from scratch. Let\u2019s do this\u2026 FEATURED DOWNLOAD:   In my Free Training \u201c30 Days to Affiliate Marketing Success\u201d I go into way more detail about how I started earning a living from affiliate marketing with my strategy. If you are interested in making a living from your own online business I highly recommend checking it out. Validation Station Before creating a course, one of the most important things you have to do is validate your concept. I know you think your idea is great, and your mom says anything you do is magical, but it all means squat if people don\u2019t actually buy the thing. Validation at it\u2019s simplest form is getting people to pay for what you haven\u2019t yet created. So why is validation so important? 1. Validation allows you to tweak before you build \u2014The common model for building products is we have an idea\u2026we go into our workshop to make it\u2026.we emerge back into civilization\u2026we shout from the rooftops what we\u2019ve made\u2026.we wait and hope we hit the mark and people actually give us money. And sometimes this can work. But sometimes it can lead to a huge flop that could have been prevented. By getting others involved early in the process, you can get actual feedback from real customers and build not what you think they want but what they actually want. 2. Validation prevents you from wasting time later \u2014Let\u2019s say you followed the traditional model of design-build-sell and you completely missed the mark. Now you\u2019re back at the drawing board basically starting over. But what if you could get it right from the beginning? Thank you validation. 3. Validation gets cash in the door \u2014I assume at least part of the reason you want to create a course is because you like to eat and live indoors. Me too. By getting people to pay for something before you\u2019ve created it, it\u2019s not only very cool, but it can also buy you some financial runway to start working on it. Think of it like Kickstarter for your course. 4. Validation lights a fire under your butt to get the course built \u2014When you have other people\u2019s money and they\u2019re expecting you to deliver on the concept you sold them on, it can be very motivating. Left on your own, you\u2019d probably do what most of us would. You\u2019d work on the course when it was convenient or when you felt like it. Bottom line\u2026you wouldn\u2019t finish it. At least not any time soon. Alright, so we get it that validation is important, but how do you actually do it? I\u2019m going to make this really simple. Rather than re-hash it, I\u2019m going to point you to another post I followed almost verbatim. My buddy Bryan Harris wrote a killer post over at VideoFruit (side note\u2026you MUST subscribe to his blog and read everything he writes). I had a good sense the speaking course would be a good fit and scratch an itch people had. But to further validate it, I followed \u201cStep 2: Validate The Product Idea\u201d from Bryan\u2019s post to the letter. Here\u2019s the nutshell\u2026I created a doc in Evernote explaining what I thought the product would look like when it was finished. I talked about how it would help them and what they would get. I also covered my own story to establish some more credibility. And then I asked of the sale. I used Gumroad for this and after emailing ~200 people (in 3 different groups like Bryan recommended), I had 22 people sign up for $197 each. (To give some more context, I assumed for a while this was a product people would be interested in, so I had been keeping a small list of those who had asked questions about speaking and expressed interest in the topic. That way I had a handful I could email when I decided to validate the concept. Remember, we\u2019re not talking about a list of thousands. I started by emailing 200 people I thought would be interested.) Keep in mind that I hadn\u2019t created anything yet. No lessons were made. I wasn\u2019t even clear on what the finished product would look like. This blew my mind. There were 22 people who just sent me $197 essentially for thin air. Crazy. But this validated the concept, and I felt confident we were onto something. Building So now I have 22 people\u2019s money, and I have to deliver them something. Time to get to work. Here\u2019s how I built the course\u2026 Create a deadline. Create an outline. Connect the dots. That was really it. I started by picking a finish line. This was partly to make sure I stayed on track and delivered to those 22 early adopters without dragging my feet. I chose March 3rd as my deadline. At the time, this was around mid-January, so I had around 45ish days to make this happen. That was pretty fast, but I was also pretty focused on getting it completed and out there. One of the first steps I took was to create the outline. I started by making a list of all the common questions I got on the subject and then organized them into a logical flow for a course. I landed on 26 lessons that were organized into 8 modules. Each module had 3-5 lessons underneath it. Which raises the question\u2026 What\u2019s the right amount of modules/lessons? I don\u2019t think there is a right or wrong answer. It largely depends on your audience and your topic. Some topics need to be shorter, smaller, bite sized lessons. My friend, Darrell Vesterfelt, has a course called  Author Launch  which is all about going from concept to a published book. His course is broken down into 46 weeks of training that you must go through sequentially. Each week builds on the previous, so you can\u2019t skip around. While both of these formats work, you just have to decide what makes sense for both your audience and your topic. After I created my master outline, I did a few things I would recommend\u2026 1. Send it to your early adopter test group.  Get their feedback before you\u2019ve spent hours and hours building something. Make sure it\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for. Ask if there\u2019s anything missing. Ask what lessons excite them the most. See if it seems to be in a logical flow for them to follow. You gave them a huge discount upfront in part because they agreed to share their feedback along the way. So ask for their feedback! 2. Create your creation plan.  You know what lessons you\u2019re creating now. You know when your deadline is. Now you can reverse engineer to figure out what you need to be doing each week to stay on track. This planning part is so critical and will save you so much time down the road. If you know you have 45 days to create your course, you can\u2019t lolly gag your way to day 43 and then try to cram everything in. That\u2019s dumb, and it doesn\u2019t work. I decided each lesson would be Keynote slides with me doing voiceover teaching. This is a pretty common approach for a lot of online courses. So I knew there were a few things that needed to happen with each lesson\u2026 Create lesson outline. Create lesson slides. Record lesson. Upload to actual online course. Here\u2019s where I saved a lot of time (and headaches). I focused on what only I could do. From that list, I knew I had to do 1 & 3. But I could have someone else handle 2 & 4. Could I do those? Sure. Would it have taken me a lot longer? Absolutely. And I knew if I was going to meet my deadline, doing 2 & 4 wouldn\u2019t be the best use of my time. So I hired Jeff. Jeff made things much easier for me. Jeff knows all that technical stuff. I don\u2019t. You need to hire a Jeff. So we created a timeline that had me basically creating the outlines for 2 modules per week. I created each lesson outline within Evernote and literally just made an outline and bolded everything I wanted a slide for. Then I would share that file with Jeff and he would create the actual Keynote (or Powerpoint) slides. (side note: I had my graphic designer create a few template slides we could build everything off of. Once the template is done, you\u2019re just tweaking the text on each slide.) He would send the slides back to me and then I would record the video lesson with them. Then I would send the file back to him and he would do some light editing and then upload to the course. Basically, each time we completed a piece, we passed it back to the other one to knock out the next step. So here\u2019s an example of how that looked on a given week\u2026 Me\u2014create outlines for module 7 lessons Him\u2014build slides for module 6 Me\u2014record lessons for module 5 Him\u2014upload lessons to site for module 4 This created a good rhythm for us and helped us keep moving forward. Depending on what you have going in life, it may take you a little longer (or maybe you could do it faster), but the point is that you create a timeline and you stick to it. Focus on what you do best and then outsource the rest. Those 45ish days required a ton of focused work. It was tiring and mentally exhausting. But we stuck to our timeline and there was never any question of what we needed to work on next. We stayed head down for those few weeks and got it done. We had validated and built a course in under 2 months. Now let\u2019s see if anyone will buy it\u2026 Launch From the beginning (even before creating your course), it\u2019s important to have an idea of how you plan to market and sell it. Will you do a big open/close launch? Will you work with JVs? Will your course just be evergreen and be available for purchase any time on your site? Will you use webinars? Will you just pitch to your email list? How will people find out about your course and be able to purchase it? Your answer to this question will most likely evolve and change over time. However, in the beginning, if you\u2019re not clear on how you\u2019ll sell the course, then why are you doing it? I see new authors make this mistake with a book. They write a book with no plan of how they\u2019ll sell it and then are surprised when no one shows up. Despite what the movie  Field of Dreams  will tell you\u2026 \u201cIf you build it, they will NOT come!\u201d It\u2019s great that you built a course, wrote a book, put up a website, or launched your new product or service. But can I be honest? Nobody cares (except maybe your mom). Not trying to be mean, but they don\u2019t. People care about themselves. Not whatever your latest project is. But\u2026.. If your latest course/book/project/website helps them, then maybe they\u2019ll care. But you need to know how you\u2019ll find those people who have a problem that you created the solution for. I decided on using Facebook ads that would funnel to weekly live webinars. Why? A few reasons\u2026 1. I had done a few Q&A webinars before and had seen the power of them. I had also heard/seen many others have great success with selling through a webinar. 2. Given the topic of my course (speaking), doing live webinars seemed like a great way to demonstrate my own experience and expertise as a speaker (credibility for selling) seemed like it would be more powerful than email, social media, etc (although we still use those to push people to the webinar). 3. I had seen this weekly webinar model work with others. When doing anything online or offline, there\u2019s no need to reinvent the wheel. Pay attention to what is working for others and see how you could do something similar. I had seen John Lee Dumas use this same model with great success for his Podcaster\u2019s Paradise course. In fact, I went back through and read his early posts of when he started using this model and found online videos where he talked about what he did to make this work. I felt confident we could make this same model work for us. By mid-February, we were on track to have the course created on time, so we scheduled our first webinar for our finish line date of March 3. To fill the webinar, we planned to do 2 things\u2026 1. Email our own list.  Not everyone on my list would be interested in speaking but as a speaker, I knew a decent number would be, so it made sense to email the entire list for this initial launch. 2. Let\u2019s try Facebook ads.  I spent $535.13 over 7 days and got 341 webinar registrants ($1.57 per lead\u2026pretty good). From that first webinar, we had 13 sales totaling $5,161. Not bad. We had launched. Between the beta test group (22 people joined at $197) and this initial launch, we were nearing $10k already. Pricing Let\u2019s pause for a second to talk about course pricing\u2026 Pricing a course (or any product for that matter) can be a bit more art than science. For the initial test group, we offered a lifetime membership of $197. We knew the final price would be higher but this felt like a good place to start. We also knew that given the nature of our topic (how to get booked & paid to speak), we were teaching people something that had a very clear ROI (return on investment). If you get just 1 speaking engagement, you could more than pay for your investment in this course. Pricing can often be determined by how the course helps people\u2026 Make money Save money Save time People generally put the priority in that order. A course that helps people make money can generally charge more versus a course that saves someone time. After the initial test group, we started with 3 pricing options and priced the tiers at $197, $297 and $497 which was discounted to $397 for the webinar. We ran this pricing for several weeks and found 95%+ were just buying the top tier. So we raised the top tier price to $597 and then $697. Still, everyone was just buying that top tier. Why? Primarily because we really intentionally stacked the deck for that tier. It was the only tier that got a $100 discount on the webinar. We also included some really key bonuses that people wanted that were only available in that tier. It was also the only tier where we offered a monthly payment option. Pricing theory suggests that if everyone just buys the top tier (among 3 options), you still have room to raise the price. You would like to see sales a little more distributed among the other tiers. So recently, we dropped the bottom tier, added a lot to the top tier, raised the price significantly, and now have two primary tiers at $1,197 and $697. So in 3 months of having the course out, we\u2019ve already raised the price 4 separate times to the point where it\u2019s now $1,000 over where it started. Granted, we\u2019ve also added a lot of new content and value to the course, but again that goes to show, you pick a price you feel comfortable with in the beginning and then adjust accordingly to the market. Another key rule we follow is this: when someone sees a price for our course, we promise that is the lowest price they\u2019ll ever see. If you\u2019ve ever purchased something, only to see it discounted a few days later, you know that can leave a bad taste in your mouth as a consumer. So we promise we won\u2019t do some random promotion that undercuts the price they paid. It creates mistrust with your existing customers which is no good. If you do decide you\u2019d like to lower your price, you should lower the value accordingly. For example, we recently lowed the price of our top tier down to $1,197 (which we discount to $997 on the webinar) from $1,397 (primarily because we wanted to get below the $1k mark). But I had promised all previous buyers I wouldn\u2019t give future buyers a better deal than what they received. So we decided to remove one piece of the course that involved more access to me (and thus more time commitment on my part). This justified lowering the price slightly. Alright, so that\u2019s how we\u2019ve handled pricing. Let\u2019s keep cruising\u2026 In my Free Training \u201c30 Days to Affiliate Marketing Success\u201d I go into way more detail about how I started earning a living from affiliate marketing with my strategy. If you are interested in making a living from your own online business I highly recommend checking it out. Ongoing Sales & Marketing (Webinar Strategies) We launched on March 3 and have done a live weekly webinar just about every week since then. Live webinars have always been our primary sales strategy. We\u2019ve tried JV webinars (joint venture) where we partner with someone else who has an audience who may be interested in our course. They invite their audience, I do the webinar and sales pitch. We split the profits 50/50. Win-win. These have worked extremely well, and we have several scheduled into the future. But live webinars, primarily from Facebook ads, continue to deliver for us. I get a lot of questions on this topic and what we\u2019ve done, so let\u2019s do a little Q&A time\u2026 Do you do your own Facebook ads? How do you do Facebook ads? For the first three webinars, I did the Facebook ads on my own. I wanted to get a feel for how they worked and what I needed to know. I didn\u2019t need to know all the nitty gritty, but since they were going to be such a key piece to my sales engine, I wanted to have a general idea of how they worked. After that I hired a contractor to help create and test ads. He has tested targeting, image, copy, headlines, etc. We\u2019re still doing a lot of testing, so while I don\u2019t have a definitive list of what works and what doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m not even sure my do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s list would work for your audience (and vice versa) anyway. I think in the beginning you can do the ads on your own to understand the system. Again, you don\u2019t need to know all the nuances but having a working knowledge of Power Editor is a good thing. I learned a lot about Facebook ads through reading and following people like Rick Mulready, Amy Porterfield and Laura Roeder. How many people generally show up for your webinar? For us, it has varied between 7-22% of those who register but it has averaged out to about 16%. Meaning, if I have 100 people register, I can expect around 16 to show up. Keep in mind this is cold traffic coming from Facebook ads. If you were targeting your own list or doing a JV webinar, the show up rate would be higher, because there\u2019s already some built in trust there. For example, in the JV webinars we\u2019ve done, the show up rate has averaged 32%, literally double the Facebook traffic. How many people on the webinar will buy? Again, this will vary depending on several factors. One big factor is the price of the course. As we\u2019ve raised our price, the percentage of buyers has dropped (fewer buyers) but the revenue dollar amount has gone up (higher ticket item). But so far, we\u2019ve had between 4-18% conversion rates. That is based off the number of people on the webinar, not the total who registered. Our current average is 10%. Meaning, based on the numbers I\u2019ve given, if we have 100 people register, we can expect around 16 to show up. Of those 16, we can expect 1-2 buyers. What do you do about the people who registered but didn\u2019t show up or buy? Great question! To be honest, we\u2019re still trying to figure out the best ways of handling this. But if you\u2019re keeping score at home from my previous example, you can see that of the 100 people that registered, 98-99 did not buy. That\u2019s a lot! But they raised their hand and expressed interest by registering for the webinar, so you can\u2019t just cast them aside. You have no idea why they didn\u2019t show up or buy, so don\u2019t give up on them. Right now we\u2019re trying a variety of different things such as waiting a few weeks and inviting them back to another webinar, sending them through a 30-day email sequence to warm them up again, etc. I don\u2019t have a definitive answer, but again, I think a lot of it would depend on your audience and what it is you\u2019re offering. The bottom line is continue to build that rapport and relationship with them, so you can stay top-of-mind. When is the best day/time for a webinar? Like everything else, there can be a lot of factors that go into this. You have to consider time zones (both domestic and international), people\u2019s general work schedules, length of your webinar, etc. Right now, we generally do all of our webinars on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday at either 3p CDT or 7p CDT. Do you show a replay? If so, how long do you leave it up? Again, we\u2019ve tried both and there are pros and cons both ways. If you have a replay, it gives people a reason not to show up. If you don\u2019t have a replay, you may get a slightly higher show up rate, but you\u2019re missing out on a lot of people who just legitimately couldn\u2019t make it and would have loved to have seen a replay. Currently, we do show a replay but we only leave it up for 48-72 hours. The longer you leave it up, the less likely people will be to actually watch it. If you leave it up indefinitely, they\u2019ll probably never watch it. You want to force them to make a decision. If you\u2019re going to leave it up, you\u2019ll want to factor in which day it would come down and how that might affect viewing. We\u2019ve tried ending on the weekend as well as during the week, and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a clear cut winner for us yet. Why don\u2019t you do automated/evergreen webinars? Of course by doing automated or evergreen webinars, you don\u2019t have to be on live and someone can view the webinar at their convenience. And while we are interested in testing this in the near future, there\u2019s also something extremely powerful about live webinars. When you give people shout outs or answer their specific question live, it creates a powerful connection. I know of many sales that have come as a result of the connection I made with someone through the live webinar. You don\u2019t get that from a recording. Plus, given the nature of my course topic (speaking), it seems to make more sense to do it live. And personally, I enjoy doing them. I know live webinars freak people out, but I think they\u2019re a lot of fun. Strange, I know Totals Here are some total numbers from course concept until June this year (6 months): Total Course Members: 212From Initial launch: 22From Facebook Ads Webinars: 158From JV Webinars: 32 Total Revenue: $141,659 (~$71,000 of that total is in monthly payments we will receive over the coming months) Expenses:Facebook Ads \u2013 $33,946.71JV Split \u2013 $7,077 List Growth: 11,099 new email subscribersFrom Facebook ads: 9,993 (16 webinars)From JV webinars: 1,106 (4 JV webinars) Tools We Used One place a lot of people get hung up on with course creation and promotion is the tools. It doesn\u2019t have to be that complicated. While there are plenty of great options out there, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve used and why\u2026 Leadpages \u2014This should be a staple in everyone\u2019s digital tool belt by now. We use Leadpages for our webinar registration page, the replay page, and to host the webinar itself. Google Hangouts \u2014This is the tool we use for our live webinars. It\u2019s free for an unlimited number of attendees. There is a 20-30 second time delay you have to get used to, but for free, it works. Chatroll \u2014On the webinars, we use Chatroll as our chat box tool. Chatroll + Google Hangouts all hosted on a Leadpage makes for a pretty solid webinar experience. Wishlist \u2014There are lots of course creation tools, but we went with Wishlist primarily because it was what my tech guy (Jeff) was most familiar with. ConvertKit \u2014ConvertKit is an up and comer in the crowded email service provider space. Nathan Barry and his team have been adding new features like madmen and it\u2019s quickly turning into a solid solution. SamCart \u2014We use SamCart for our shopping cart system which connects to Stripe for payment processing. It\u2019s an easy to use site and integrates well with several other tools. Gumroad \u2014We used Gumroad for our initial beta test group. It is the quickest, simplest tool out there for getting a \u201cbuy\u201d link to a customer right away. Final Lessons Learned If you\u2019ve made it this far in reading this post, you get a gold star. Congrats. I know we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground here and it\u2019s easy to get lost in all the details, but let me summarize some of the big lessons I\u2019ve learned in 6 months of creating and selling a course\u2026 1. Solve A Specific Pain \u2014The more specific it is, the better. My friend Joe Michael (who I referenced above) has a course about the writing tool Scrivener. He has over 5,000 members in his course. Let that sink in. Over 5,000 members in a course for a writing tool most people have never heard of. He could have done a course on writing or publishing or something really big and vague, but he went with something super specific, and it\u2019s paid off big time. 2. Validate \u2014Don\u2019t just start building what you think people will want. Actually talk to other humans to find out what they need and THEN start creating your solution. And don\u2019t just ask if they think they would buy it. They\u2019ll give you a verbal \u2018yes\u2019 99% of the time. Because they\u2019re nice. If they really think you can solve the specific pain they have, they\u2019ll be willing to pay you to make it happen. 3. Set A Deadline and Stick To It \u2014Don\u2019t just work on the course when you feel like it. It\u2019ll never get done. Create the deadline and then reverse engineer what needs to happen to stay on track. Find someone who will hold you accountable or start/join a mastermind that can kick your butt. 4. Focus on Version 1.0 \u2014Your first version of the course will be the worst it will ever be. It will only get better from there. But you cannot have version 2.0 until you\u2019ve completed 1.0. I have an iPhone 6 which is a pretty slick device, but you know what had to come before it? iPhone 1. You do the best with what you have at the time and improve as you go. You can make it better over time, but right now, focus on getting version 1.0 out the door. 5. Test It \u2014In my mastermind group, we use this phrase all the time. There\u2019s nothing wrong with theories, ideas, and hunches, but how do you know what will work best in any given situation? You have to test it. Which day is better for your webinars? Try a few different days and compare the results. Which converts better\u2026email or webinars? Test it. You have to be willing to have the mentality of a scientist running experiments. Some will be huge failures and others will be huge successes, but you don\u2019t know unless you try. Creating a course can be a game changer both for your business and for your ability to help others. But it won\u2019t just magically happen. How long are you going to keep watching others profit from their courses before you get in the game? What\u2019s it going to take for you to take action? You can do this. Make it happen. Now What? To help you get started, I put together a bunch of bonuses related to this post I\u2019ll just hook you up with\u2026 Course validation page (exactly what I sent to those first 200 people before the course was created) Validation survey (what we sent to those first 200 people to get specific feedback) Course creation timeline (the plan we used to create the course) Course outline (see exactly how our course is set up) Webinar stats spreadsheet template (this is what we use to track everything) PDF outline summary of this entire post In my Free Training \u201c30 Days to Affiliate Marketing Success\u201d I go into way more detail about how I started earning a living from affiliate marketing with my strategy.

It has a bright 600nt full HD led screen, Snapdragon 820, 3gb ram and 32gb really fast flash storage. It runs on Android 7 so it's pretty updated and also miui has a lot of flexibility. Definitely not a stock android experience but you kinda dig it. Devices is pretty solid. Not the strongest, but has Gorilla Glass 4 both on front and rear, a beautiful 12.8mp 4k capable camera with ois, full fetched usb type-c support, 3000mah battery and quick charge and wireless charging and the list goes on and on. Not only the bareboje specs are nice, device is well put, mostly light and pretty capable too. I honestly didn't expect even the half of it's capabilities but I definitely recommend. It's community is getting bigger each day and they make the whole experience even better. How is Xiaomi Mi 5? When will Xiaomi launch the Xiaomi Mi 5C in India? Which is better - the Redmi 4 or 3S? Are Xiaomi phones good enough? Is Xiaomi Mi4 water proof? well well i was reading times of india on app in that there was an article about redmi note 4g sale in airtel outlets\u2026 At that time there was no 4g network available by any sim..still bought the mobile\u2026within a year airtel launched 4g network and it was great speed\u2026.i been using xiaomi mobile from past 3 years..i bought redmi note 4g which was launched some years back.. believe it or not i never encountered any problem with the  handset\u2026.no  no i am not at all a gentle user\u2026more than 15 times it slipped and did not encounter even a single problem\u2026beside they update their miui weekly to fix bugs and update features..i love their forums and they really help..i never been to their service center yet so really do not know about it much..but i have heard that the after sale service is getting better\u2026",

Both the cards which you mention are super premium cards and hence have a minimum prescribed limits who are pretty high. If your income level justify the limits, no problem. Since you are a preferred customer, contact your RM, he will be happy to get this done for u. How do I pay diners club card bill in HDFC? I have an HDFC Platinum Credit Card. I want to reduce the limit. How do I do so online without visiting the branch? How can I pay for a lost HDFC credit card? I'm getting a HDFC Regalia credit card free for lifetime. Shall I go for it? Which credit card is best in India? I spend on movies,travel and ... How can I get the best deal on the HDFC credit card? Hi Neha, thanks for A2A and it seems you have asked me few questions already and I'm really sorry for not being able to answer them , However coming to your question, yes you can get two credit cards from HDFC( From any bank) , just ask them to give you an add on credit card on your current credit card. Hope that helps and thank for reading and just keep living !! Thanks for asking. You may opt for 2nd card from HDFC. The most important thing which the credit manager will look forward to is your Income Level. Based on your income level only ( apart of the basic & first check of credit score through PAN ), the credit limit is provided by the credit managers. There could be two things: They may issue you a new card with proportionate sharing of the limit with the old card. Thus your credit limit may remain same and could be distributed among two cards. Or a little hike could be given combining both. Based on your payment industry & new income assessment ( if its higher than the last time ), you may be issued with a new card irrespective of the last cards limit. But if you are a regalia holder, you cant have another regalia. For the dinner card, they may issue you the same. Overall, I am not quite satisfied with my dinners card & rather would like to dispose it off. The best advisable is to opt for another card from another bank.",

They aren\u2019t perfect with children either. Children do not guarantee any perfection or completeness, happiness or prosperity. It could also be said, neither does lack of children equal dismal doom. Either way, we have our imperfect lives. We live them. Then we die. See also:  Amanda S. Glover's answer to If you have no children, is there a purpose for you having been born? I don't like children. Is this wrong of me to think this way? What is it like to live your life without children? How long can we live without children? My son thinks buying him running shoes will make him faster. How do I explain that they won't without hurting his feelings? I'm dating a perfect 10 girl but I can't stop thinking about my ex. What should I do? Hi there! From my perspective life is not perfect whether you have kids or not! But having said that - I have one child and I am definitely less happy than before kids, although before kids it made me stressed not having kids! I think people who have kids are, in general, less happy though and the sole reason is because having a child is the biggest responsibility. So a lot of responsibility = less happiness and joy\u2026it just seems logical to me\u2026now! I now look at couples without children and I can clearly see the wonderful opportunities that they have on offer to do whatever they want with their lives. Many people with kids [and without] can be heard saying \u2018you can still live your dreams when you have kids\u2019. I also have experienced so many parents talking to childless couples, casually saying \u2018Oh you guys should have kids..you just have to have a kid.\u2019 or this old chest nut \u2018You\u2019ll get into having kids when you have them\u2019\u2026WTF?! That has to be the most idiotic thing I have ever heard! How can people be so blase about one of the biggest ordeals of your life? In the end - raising a child cannot and should not be reduced to some \u2018kodak\u2019 moment with the hope that it will perfect an adult or couples life. It is a relentless responsibility and not only life changing for you, but what about the world you are bringing this child into. I can never re-pay the debt I bow have to my child for bringing him into a world where the environment is dying\u2026because in the end and in the short term it is not about you or I, but them! Respect, Maria There is no such thing as \u201cperfect\u201d in life, only degrees of \u201cgood enough\u201d. But what fulfills one person may not necessarily fulfill another person. As the saying goes, \u201cOne man\u2019s meat is another man\u2019s poison.\u201d Your idea of heaven might be my idea of hell. If you have a strong desire to be a parent, and you think you\u2019ll be a good one, then by all means have kids. I have no desire at all to be a parent and I know I\u2019d be a terrible one, so I\u2019ve taken precautions against becoming pregnant. And we\u2019ll each find our own happiness in life, in our own ways. I don't have children and my life is perfectly fine. It all depends on the individual. Different strokes for different folks.

Mobile app also avaable. Very helpful with customer support too. PS- I don't earn any thing through refferal. Its an honest review. I am using it for past 8 years.

Instead of improving their technical systems, they are more in making excuses.They are certainly working on new excuses to cone with in future , whenever any such thing happens like last week. Many investors and traders lost their hard earned money due to their technical issues but they were ready with appologies. I dont have any hard feelings about Zerodha, but when money is involved you should be highly serious about the issue. If you cant rectify the issue then at least tell about the same in advance to customers before market hours, instead of creating panic and not answering calls. There are many broking firms which are way better than zerodha and have dedicated trading platform. One has to agree that zerodha is facing certain issues which is adversely affecting their customers. But they are discount brokers and their customer base has gone beyond their comfort levels. I guess there has to be a sweet spot between no of customers and the charges. At such discounted rates it's not a very good idea to expand the customer base indiscriminately.

We hear ezan in Arabic and basically pray in Arabic. But this is neither necessary nor symbolic. That's why ezan was in Turkish for some time. You can hear it via this link: And here is the Arabic version. Not to mention the techniques and maqams of two ezans, maybe because of our habits, people likes the Arabic ezan more. There were times during the Turkish-ezan era that if there were no soldiers around, the imam would call for prayer back in Arabic. It is also seen as an insult or as blasphemy or something by people that are far devout. To sum it up, it was removed because people were discontent. Why did Ataturk change the language and the alphabet of modern day Turkey? Is Arabic as popular in Turkey as Turkish? Can a combined Turkish, Saudi and Qatari military alliance defeat Russia in Syria? And in this case will NATO steps up to protect Turkey from ... Are Turkish people Arab or Middle Eastern?

        "a": "What you really mean is \u201chow do I guarantee my heart will never be broken?\u201d If I absolutely had to chose I would say the former. It is best to have felt love and lost it than to have never experienced it at all. Love is not all ecstasy and it inevitably includes pain be it through the relationship or at its end. Don\u2019t be tepid, be bold, be honest, with yourself and others. I find this to be the best strategy and it comes with continued practice. You will find honesty will actually scare away a LOT of people away from you but it also narrows down the field to those truly worth your time instead of taking chances with every single person in your wake. Does it sound picky? Nope. You are being upfront, efficient, and protective of your heart and mental sanity. So in sum, it\u2019s always good to love and be in love but use honesty as your shield and discriminator to find the one best deserving of you. I've never had a mutual love relationship with a man. What is wrong with me? I am married to a girl who had a serious relationship that ended just four months before our marriage. Will she be able to love me?

I have never fallen in love. Should I force myself to try out to be in a relationship? KEEP YOUR HUSBAND . EVERY WOMAN SHOULD READ THESE 30 RULES FOR GODLY WOMEN----------- 1). Never raise your voice for any reason to your husband. Its a sign of disrespect.(Prov 15v1) 2). Don't expose your husband's weaknesses toyour family and friends. It will bounce back at you.You are each other's keeper.(Eph 5v12) 3). Never use attitudes and moods to communicate to your husband, you never know how your husband will interpret them. Defensive women don't have a happy home.(Prov 15v13) 4). Never compare your husband to other men, you've no idea what their life is all about. If you attack his Ego, his Love for you will diminish. 5). Never ill treat your husband's friends because you don't like them, the person who's supposed to get rid of them is your husband.(Prov 11v22) 6). Never forget that your husband married you, not your maid or anyone else. Do your duties.(Gen 2v24) 7). Never assign anyone to give attention to your husband, people may do everything else but your husband is your own responsibility.(Eph 5v33) 8). Never blame your husband if he comes back home empty handed. Rather encourage him.(Deut 3v28) 9). Never be a wasteful wife, your husband's sweat is too precious to be wasted. 10). Never pretend to be sick for the purpose of denying your husband sex. You must give it to him how he wants it. Sex is very important to Men, if you keep denying him, it is a matter of time before another woman takes over theat duty. No man can withstand sex starvation for too long(even the anointed ones) (SS 7v12) 11). Never compare your husband to your one time sex mate in bedroom, or an Ex-lover. Your home may Never recover from it if you do.(SS 5v9) 12). Never answer for your husband in public opinion polls, let him handle what is directed to him although he may answer for you in public opinion polls.(Prov 31v23) 13). Never shout or challenge your husband in front of children. Wise Women don't do that.(Eph 4v31) 14). Don't forget to check the smartness of your husband before he checks out.(Prov 12v4) 15). Never allow your friends to be too close to your husband. 16). Never be in a hurry in the bathroom and on the dressing table. Out there your husband is always surrounded by women who took their time on their looks.( 1 Sam25v3) 17). Your parents or family or friends do not have the final say in your marriage. Don't waste your time looking up to them for a final word. You must Leave if you want to Cleave.(Luke 21v16) 18). Never base your love on monetary things. Will you still submit to him even if you earn more money than him? 19). Don't forget that husbands want attention and good listeners, never be too busy for him. Good communication is the bed rock of every happy home. (Gal 6v9) 20). If your idea worked better than his, never compare yourself to him. Its always teamwork.(Gal 6v10) 21). Don't be too judgemental to your husband. No man wants a Nagging wife.(Eph 4v29) 22). A lazy wife is a careless wife. She doesn't even know that her body needs a bath.(Prov 24v27)(Prov 20v13) 23). Does your husband like a kind of cooked food?, try to change your cooking. No man jokes with food. (Prov 31v14) 24). Never be too demanding to your husband,enjoy every moment, resource as it comes.(Luke 11v3) 25). Make a glass of water the very first welcome to your husband and everyone entering your home. Sweetness of attitude is true beauty. (Prov 31v11) 26). Don't associate with women who have a wrong mental attitude about marriage.(Prov 22v14) 27). Your marriage is as valuable to you as the value that you give it. Recklessness is unacceptable.(Heb 13v4) 28). Fruit of the womb is a blessing from the Lord, love your children and teach them well.(Prov 22v6) 29). You are never too old to influence your home. Never reduce your care for your family for any reason. (Prov 31v28) 30). A prayerful wife is a better equipped wife, pray always for your husband and family(1 Thess 5v17) Have a lovely day..... God bless u all. If you are in a loving relationship that ends, other than the value of the experience itself, you know what to seek out and what to avoid in future relationships. If you have never been in a relationship at all, you're starting at the very bottom of the totem pole in terms of learning to navigate interpersonal relationships. A romantic partner teaches you about relationships in general, platonic or professional alike. Many people think that \u201cIt is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\u201d, though those who have lost might disagree. Another Ancient Greek writer (whose name escapes me) wrote, \u201cIt is hard to love, it is hard not to love, but hardest of all is to lose the one we love.\u201d That would be the same philosophy. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s different for everyone. For most people, however, the pain of loss fades to something you can deal with.",

I appreciate your willingness to help him achieve his goals, and I do value higher education, but I think that is an exorbitant amount of money for one child's education. I went to a public high school and I turned out okay. I've also been working since I was 11 years old (mowing neighbors lawns) and got a part time job as soon as I was old enough to washing dishes at age 14. Many kids these days wouldn't do this and save up for their own car, etc. I went on to college at 18 and paid 1/3 of it (parents paid the other 2/3) but it still took a year to find a \u201creal job\u201d and it didn't pay that much either. About 3\u20134 years after college I started my own business and continued my own self-taught education for the next 10+ years and developed skills and experience that effectively multiplied my earning potential by 2-3 times in the job market. The past 5 years I've found low-cost forms of higher education and paid for them out of my own pocket while working simultaneously. I'm not saying any of this to brag. It wasn't always easy or even easier either, but I feel the experience of choosing this non-traditional route has been rewarding. It has also made me value my education even more because I not only had to work hard at school, I had to work hard creating the way for my opportunity just to learn in school or elsewhere. This is valuable in the real world and it builds strong character. If he wants to be a doctor he should learn now, at a young age, to be hard working, develop creativity and ingenuity, and not expect any hand outs. While he is thinking outside the box a little in using generosity it is still asking others to pay it for him. \u201cThat which a man earns easily, he esteems lightly.\u201d Socialism is toxic to building character, creativity and entrepreneurialism. Free hand outs, including free education, can be nice but they can also instill a sense of entitlement. And entitlement breeds immaturity, moral relativity, laziness, and many other poor ethics in our overly emotional, PC culture that is developing grown adult children in droves that live with their parents until their 20-30s, want free healthcare and everything else, and want their first minimum wage job to pay them $15/hour. The world needs educated people, but it needs mature, hard working, good people more. So that's what I recommend. Tell him to ask for donations, and maybe get a few, but focus 95% of his work efforts like he doesn't expect them. And perhaps you could share this message with him and it will inspired him to just get creative and come up with a way on his own, without any free handouts.

There is actually very little similarities in their work, other than superficial stuff. The only major similarity I can think of is that both Tarantino and Scorcese make the best of their specific types of films in the history of filmmaking. In other words, both are masters at what they do, but they do completely different things. Does Quentin Tarantino play a part in Hostel? Why does Quentin Tarantino play a minor role in his movies? Would Quentin Tarantino make a good TV show? What is Quentin Tarantino like in person? What's Quentin Tarantino's worst movie? The main difference is Quentin Tarantino don\u2019t do Biopic as Martin Scorcese . Quentin play with human pain but Scorcese plays with human emotion . They both dont takes any sequels to there over (kill bill was taken as one movie it was cut into two because of its running time) both of them love violence . Both of them master placing shot . There are more similarities between QT and Scorcese than the difference .",

There\u2019s been research on using technical analysis to automate buying/selling of stocks automatically thru a set of rules that are pre-defined, but it wouldn\u2019t be close to the returns you are targeting & there needs to be some human intervention to track news, events, results of stocks that you\u2019ve invested in. Many technical analyst use a wide range of technical indicators for stock analysis, like  RSI, MACD, Supports & Resistance levels on Candlestick charts  to help predict future stock trends along with keeping a track of all events/markets that can impact the stock/sector. I would suggest learning about & tracking these indicators to help you make informed trading/investing decisions. There are many sites that provide these  indicators/tools freely for Indian stock markets , eg:  Live Technical Analysis, Charts, Screener Research & Price Once you are comfortable with a trading strategy, like  entering a stock once its crossed a resistance level  OR  when certain indicators give a breakout  you can then start looking/searching for these specific stocks. I\u2019ve also across many traders having technical strategies based on  Moving averages, Rsi, Ichimoku Cloud crossovers  etc & also using oldest of the stock charting system, which are the  Point and Figure Charts . These trading systems/indicators have been used since the past several decades & have been quite helpful for traders. To save your time, there are  Stock Screeing tools  that help you find/search only those stocks that match your own trading strategies. I\u2019d like to highlight a few of the commonly used trading strategies by traders across India: Volume shockers (stocks with rising volumes) - Stocks that have seen an sudden rise in their volume by over 2x times the average volume over the past 10 trading sessions and have gained or lost more than 5% today Macd bearish or bullish crossover - Macd signal line crossovers Short term breakouts - Stocks trading near their high in the past 4 months with rising volumes and closing strong, indicating a possible breakout Morning star candlestick pattern - Bullish reversal pattern in which a stock which had a long white body a 2 days ago, then opened lower with a doji a day ago and finally closed above the previous day Strong stocks - Stocks closing higher than their previous trading day continuously for the past 5 days Golden cross scan - Stocks where the 50 simple moving average(sma) has crossed above the 200 simple moving average . Evening star candlestick pattern - Bearish reversal pattern in which a stock which had a long white body a day ago, closed lower today 200 sma crossover - Crossed 200 sma with macd crossover & volume > 2 times of 10 days sma Cci buy and sell signals - Commodity channel index signals when crossing above 100(buy) or crossing below -100(sell) Upper bollinger band crossover(daily) - Stocks closing over their upper bollinger band indicating a buy signal Ichimoku uptrend cloud crossover - Stocks closing crossing the cloud & span a greater than span b, indicating a positive trend Weekly rsi oversold/overbought scan - Crossover when weekly rsi crosses above 30(oversold) or rsi crosses below 70(overbought) Parabolic sar buy and sell signals - Parabolic sar signals when close crossing above psar(buy) or close crossing below psar(sell) And you can also develop your own strategies using a combination of indicators from above & test it for a few weeks before making any investments. Hope this helps Which is the best software to do stock trading on a Mac in the Indian stock market? Which stocks can give a 10-15% return in May 2017? I am thinking of investing 60k in the Indian stock market. What are few tips for trading in Indian stock market? What are the trading secrets? What are the best stocks trading now around 50 Rs in Indian stock market? Do I need an agent to start trading in the Indian stock market? There are multiple strategies which are profitable more than 90% of the time. For instance, Underwriting Far  Out Of The Money Options  is an effective strategy. Theoretically, if one were to underwrite options with a strike price two standard deviations away from the current price, there is a 95% probability that one stands to make money. [1] However, the market aligns the payoffs in a similar manner. For instance the payoff from underwriting options is fixed while the possible liability is theoretically unlimited. Its pointless for an algorithm to be profitable 90% of the time, if the reward is a 10th of the possible loss. Theoretically, its impossible to make more returns than the tangency portfolio. [2]  However, if one isn\u2019t a proponent of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, it should be possible to make more in returns than the corresponding tangency portfolio would make for the same amount of risk. However, making profits 90% of the time borders on absurd. Coming specifically, to your asking for an algorithm which makes money more than 90% of the time, If such an algorithm existed, you\u2019d probably not be told, unless you developed it. For instance the folks over at Renaissance Technologies could probably tell you quite a bit about the algorithms that you seek, but I doubt that they\u2019d hand them out over Quora. [3] Also, be wary of anyone who sells you algorithms which work 90% of the time. Its either a Ponzi scheme, or will stop providing results soon, when the inefficiency it exploits vanishes. Its also possible that you could lose a fortune because of the methods it employs. Not even geniuses are exempt from the vagaries of markets. [4] I\u2019d suggest that you abandon your search for the perfect algorithm, and settle for something that you believe is profitable. I\u2019ve technically been profitable on nearly 90% of my trades at  Intelligent Investing , and have averaged over 70% in returns since inception. The trades are more long term in nature than you might want, but I believe it might help. Footnotes [1]  68\u201395\u201399.7 rule - Wikipedia [2]  What is the tangency portfolio? [3]  Inside a Moneymaking Machine Like No Other [4]  Long-Term Capital Management: It's a short-term memory There's no such algorithm which gives 80% or 90% success rate, Any good system will have a 40% to 60% success rate, Apart from the success rate  Risk:Reward  ratio is the important factor to gauge any system, if a trading system got a success rate of 45+% and a Risk / Reward of 1:3 and above, I'll consider it as a Good system.",

        "a": "no one should carry a fake passport. Word of warning: carrying a fake identification document of whatever nature is illegal in most places and could land you in jail, even if you don\u2019t intend to use them. There\u2019s a lot of reasons why someone would carry two passports. The most common, within the people I know, are: 1.- double nationality/citizenship. You may be a US citizen, for example, but your parents may be Italian. In cases such as this, you may be entitled to get an italian passport which doesn\u2019t replace your american one but rather extends certain travel possibilities such as entering some countries without a Visa or Reciprocity fee using your italian passport, instead of the US passport which would require payment of a reciprocity fee (Argentina charges a 160 USD RF to US Citizens, but not to italian citizens, for example) The opposite also works: Argentinians need a US Visa to enter the US. Many Argentinians have italian ancestry and can lawfully obtain an italian passport, which they do because Italy is a Visa Waiver Program country. Travelling with an italian passport, Argentinians can enter the US under the VWP with just an ESTA form. 2.- current Visa on your expired passport. This is actually my case for a couple of countries, including the US. My still current US Visa (from the time nationals from my country needed a US Visa to enter as tourists) is stamped on one of my expired passports. Since I don\u2019t travel under the Visa Waiver Program -why would I? I still have a Visa- I need to carry my current passport as a valid travel document and my expired passport in order to present the Visa to the CBP officer. In neither of the above cases any passport is a fake. Can I get to Alaska without a passport? Do fake passports really work? How much does a fake passport cost to buy? How do I check if a passport number is fake? How non-trivial is it to make a fake passport? Traveling on a fake passport is a great way to find out how the prison systems in foreign countries work. I travel with two passports because I'm a citizen of two countries. Both are authentic and legal. Both countries know I have two.",

        "a": "Yes, but only if you do it really fast or really subtly. If they have time to react they can Apparate out of the way, deflect any strike or heal almost all non-magical wounds. If you shot them in the head without warning, or poisoned or gassed them in a very slow covert way which they wouldn't notice until it was too late, then they would die, but if they realised you were trying to kill them they would usually be able to stop you. You could also probably kill them with overwhelming force, since their weapons have a limited range and they have to think or say a spell-word to use them. But only if they couldn't just Apparate away. Is the killing curse the only way to kill a wizard using magic? Did Harry Potter create a Horcrux while killing Lord Voldemort? On the night James and Lily died, James was ready to die for Lily & Harry. Why didn't the charm work like with Lily protecting Harry? In Harry Potter, is it true that if you kill, your soul splits? Why didn't Harry Potter die at the end of the 7th book? Well, it's obviously true isn't it? Come on, you stab a person (enough times if necessary), he's gonna die. You can straight up strangle a wizard, and he's gonna die. Like Snape was killed by venom, you can kill a person from venomous bites of snakes/insects/magical creatures, which is a pretty Muggle way to kill a person. Of course, there are  MANY  potions/powders that can be used for assassination/warfare, maybe just like how Walter White made Ricin, just with some magical ingredients. I'm pretty sure Ricin will wizards too. Well, I know this is pretty brutal, but you can literally boil/roast a person/wizard to death, obviously! Why do you think wizards are scared of dragons? Other Muggle ways to die, include being trampelled on by huge creatures, maybe like Giants, centaurs (kinda big, aren't they?), and those huge Erumpents from Fantastic beasts (movie). Or getting your head bitten off from Fluffy? Yeah, not pleasant. Uhh, I guess I've made my point clear. It is implied that wizards can only be killed using magical means. To quote J. K. Rowling, \u201cI decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening.\u201c So wizards can\u2019t be killed by things that are purely muggle. They can be killed by  magical  snakes (the basilisk, nagini who had part of a wizard inside), other  magical  creatures (dragons, giants, probably acromantulas), explosions c aused by magic  (Wormtail\u2019s spell) or magical plants (Bode), but going by what JKR said as well as the fact that not a single witch or wizard in the books was killed by completely non-magical means, it seems that wizards can\u2019t be killed in muggle ways. (Also, if your question is just about whether they have to be killed by the killing curse, no, they don\u2019t-see the examples above.) TL;WR:  Avada Kedavra Indeed yes. In  The Philospher\u2019s Stone,  Quirrel tries to kill Harry by strangling him. He knows it will work. Its a pretty muggle way to kill someone. In  Chamber of Secrets,  T. M. Riddle tries killing Harry by a snake. And same in  Deathly Hallows, Snape  is killed by a  snake.  (Sorry, I just had to do this) In  Prisoner of Azkaban,  we learn that Peter Pettigrew killed people by blowing up a street.  cough  Nukes  cough Let us assume that in  Half-Blood Prince,  the killing curse on Dumbledore somehow did the thing of  Impedimenta.  Again, death by pushing off a bazillion foot high tower. TL;DR;  Abracadabra Yes. Broderick Bode, an Unspeakable from the Department of Mysteries, was strangled to death by a Devil\u2019s Snare via sheer brute force. Plenty of wizards and witches have lost their lives to dragons, who can burn, devour or tail whip their victims to death. Trolls and Giants have used clubs against wizardkind for a long time. Draco Malfoy was almost killed by a vicious attack by Buckbeak the Hippogriff. Lastly, Dobby the House-elf was killed by a knife. House-elves are potentially more magical than a wizard or witch, capable of Apparition in even Anti-apparition areas like Hogwarts.",

        "a": "Twenty-eight years ago, it was May of 1989. Donald J. Trump had paid $85,000 dollars to post ads in multiple NYC newspapers demanding a return of the death penalty, an end to complaints about police brutality, and stating that \u201cCIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS\u201d The ads ran in response to the arrest and (coerced) confession of the  Central Park Five , after a brutal attack on a jogger in the park. All five were subsequently exonerated, when DNA evidence and a corroborating confession fingered a completely different man. Their convictions were vacated in 2002, and in 2014 the city finally settled their countersuit for $40 million. Donald Trump wrote an op-ed calling that settlement \u201c a disgrace \u201d and pointing out the young men in question did \u201cnot exactly have the pasts of angels.\u201d Which apparently in his mind is sufficient reason to uphold a wrongful conviction, as long as it\u2019s not a conviction of him personally. In other words, regardless of what party he was registered to, or donating money to buy (and the Donald first registered as a Republican in 1987, though the switched by to being a registered Democrat for a while from 2001\u20132009) national Democrats and DJ Trump actually are not, and were not, aligned overall. The Donald\u2019s attitudes on race put him in alignment with the segregationist southern Democrats who had largely moved into the Republican tent by 1987, is about the closest commonality you can get, and the \u201claw-and-order\u201d rhetoric of those 1989 ads was straight out of the Lee Atwater Republican playbook. Arguably his apathy to most of the religion and culture war issues that animate the hard right made him less than a \u201creal\u201d Republican for most of that time, but i think being a lukewarm Republican is not quite the same as being aligned with the Democrats. Original question: For 28 years, Democrats and DJ Trump were aligned. How many of those Democrats are still aligned with DJ Trump and what has changed? Why did so many Democrats vote for Trump? Could Donald Trump be a Democratic plant? Is he trying to help Hillary Clinton? Will Donald Trump defeat his opponent in the general election? If voters were won over to Trump by Jimmy Fallon ruffling his hair, is it really ethical for Democrats to pursue those voters? What was with t... Why is Ben Carson so upset about the GOP aligning against Trump? Trump played both sides of the political aisle, himself having no special political convictions, and like many business people, finding it astute and wise to contribute to both parties so as to be in good with whoever was in power. It's not my impression that Democrats were ever \"aligned\u201d with Trump, as opposed to being willing to take his campaign contributions. What is changed is pretty obvious. Trump is now a Republican president carrying out a far right Republican agenda, and doing so in a way that deliberately marginalizes the Democrats. Why on earth should the Democrats \"align\" with a Republican president who opposes them and is uninterested in compromise? Some grassroots Democratic voters may have supported Trump in the past election cycle, in part perhaps because of his at that time populist appeal. I don't know how many of these remain, but I would be surprised if it were very many. (Update) After recent revelations of possible obstruction of justice and lies that even Trump can't wriggle out of, probably even fewer. There is a flaw in the premise for your question and may force you to fundamentally rewrite this question. Donald Trump has never aligned with anyone other than himself. [And I should include several citations, but it becomes too quickly too unwieldy.]. All past examples and evidence indicates that alignments are purely coincidental or worse, contrived by himself for when seeking an opportunity. For most of his professional career Donald Trump was rarely publicly identified as a Democrat. Given that his father worked in a mostly Democratic city, his father must have had ties to local politicians. I lived in the NYC area most of my life and had no idea what his politics was. Given that he was Protestant I would have guessed that he was likely a Republican. Donald Trump giving his support to Democrat candidates doesn't mean that the Democrats were aligned with him. The fact that he got along so well with the Clintons isn't surprising, they share many unsavoury traits.",

How do we find out how far away pulsars and quasars are? How is the Sun different from other stars on the main sequence? How is it different from a giant star?

I\u2019ve seen many foreign airlines that have beautiful aircraft and great service on board but completely fail as far as customer service is concerned, when problems arise. I think that in general, airlines in the US are seen as a transportation utility, a means of getting from one point to another. This, while in many other places airlines are the \u201cnational carrier\u201d, serving as the country\u2019s face to the world with tremendous government subsidies. The same, by the way, goes for airports. In the US airports are seen as a place you go to catch a flight, while in many countries airports are a central piece of national pride, a gateway to the world and the first impression visitors get when arriving there. When is the best time to buy a plane ticket? What do people hate most about airline travel? Why are the flight attendants of US major airlines so much older than Asian and European airlines on average for example? What is the best airline to fly from India to USA? I've heard that Spirit Airlines has very poor service / on-time reliability -- is that true? People prefer different things from their airlines. I think this type of comment reveals more about a person\u2019s expectations than an objective view about what makes an airline \u201cbetter\u201d. Having said that, many airlines do not have the same market pressures or workforce pressures impacting their delivery of customer service as US airlines. Some airport infrastructure issues affect people's perceptions of their traveling experience, and that has often very little to do with the airlines. Many overseas airports are nicer and have more amenities than US airports. Again, aside from the First class/business class lounge, very little an airline in the US can do about that. As others have said, different cultures and employment rules. At a lot of foreign airlines they weigh the flight attendants before each flight or fire them at a certain age. US employment laws forbid that. Thus you have a lot older FA\u2019s working for US carriers than some foreign ones. Also US workers may have a contract protecting them versus at will employees overseas. But really it comes down to expectations. US flyers have said they want the cheapest tickets possible, so US airlines operate under those conditions. Other foreign carriers that are govt subsidized don't have as many restrictions. Like everything else, customer service is Dead in the US. Notice 99% of companies, especially scumbag cable and phone companies, offer: \u2018new clients\u2019 special deals. Somewhere along the way, sucking in new clients became more important than honoring/keeping old clients, short of saying \u2018screw you ahole, you\u2019re already locked in a contract, haha\u2019 US firms blatantly put on so many ads: \u2018special discounts for new clients only\u2019. The airline? It\u2019s common knowledge constant flying constipates you, enough that the employees are so blocked up they all behave like their mommy hates them. Because most reports concern the American airlines. I\u2019m fairly certain stupid things happen elsewhere, but the locals don\u2019t have the intense fixation that North Americans have with these type of occurrences. Please note I include Canada and Mexico in that although I maybe unfair to Mexico for doing so.

Pinochet\u2019s military regime was in fact sort of \u201c neo-liberal  extremist\u201d (if such a thing exists), instead of actually fascist. Fascism (as it existed in Italy, Spain, Nazi Germany) is not actually neo-liberal/ truly capitalist, in the sense of the free market as we know it here, and so forth. Private property, private industry ownership (though with heavy state intervention), etc,  can  be maintained under fascism. But fascists are Statist semi-collectivists, with a heavily economically protectionist or economically nationalist bent \u2014 such as extreme tariffs, etc, very much not fans of free trade (Spain under Franco was originally autarkist). And they had a centrally planned sort of economy and system (the Nazi economy was under \u201cfour year plans\u201d and the Nazis initiated price, wage, and rent controls from about 1936). See also:  Four Year Plan - Wikipedia Pinochet\u2019s was not like that. He was under the sway of the so-called  Chicago Boys - Wikipedia , and the economic system that they put into place under his regime in Chile (arguably even more  laissez-faire , privatized, and truly capitalist/free market oriented than the US today ~ or every bit as much) led to, by most accounts, the Chilean economy\u2019s pretty drastic and rather sudden turnaround and improvement compared to how it had been prior. There\u2019s debate on that, of course, but it was called the  Miracle of Chile - Wikipedia  by \u201cNobel laureate economist  Milton Friedman \u201d. Stroessner\u2019s regime in Paraguay maybe was more so closer to a fascist type of economics, in a sense (a lot of public works projects, and large portions of the budget allotted to military and police apparatuses \u2014 it was really a military/police state). But it was still not really the truly fascist \u2018corporatist\u2019 state such as in Italy under Mussolini, or (at least in the earlier years) Spain under Franco. (Spain also changed over to a more neo-liberal, not truly fascist, economy \u2014 following the war \u2014 and was eventually much more successful for it). The military junta in Argentina from about the mid-70\u2019s, under Videla, was also rather similar to Pinochet as described above as far as economics (though they did not get along\u2026). Heavy deregulation, privatization, encouragement of free trade, etc; although in Argentina\u2019s case it did not seem to have worked out quite as well for the Argentinian economy as it did for Chile\u2019s. They all participated, along with some other South American right-wing dictatorial type regimes as well (such as in Bolivia, Uruguay, Brazil), in the so-called \u201cOperation Condor\u201d which was a coordinated repressive program targeting leftists and socialists or communists. But what they were really fighting for, with covert aid and so forth from the US of course, was less so fascism and more so neoliberal- style free-market, free trade sorts of systems as favored by the United States (particularly as opposed to leftism). They were, in my view, more so military regimes essentially, or military-led regimes \u2014 or junta is a term sometimes used (such as Argentina\u2019s Videla \u201cjunta\u201d) \u2014 which were very much autocratic, very anti-communist, and not truly socially free or genuinely democratic of course, but not actually really fascist either. Why would the United States care if a small nation like Vietnam were to become communist? Why is the United States so anti socialist? Why is regime change a policy of the United States? Is the United States an anti child country? Is it true South American countries don't like America? People have told me relations have been worse. Why? They could be described that way, sure. It would just be a false description, sort of like describing a horse as a turtle. Historically, yes. Certainly Pinochet in Chile was. I attended a presentation decades ago where Pinochet was described as further to the right than any contemporary Chilean. He was installed by the US. I don\u2019t study Latin America enough, but I can\u2019t think of any current fascist regimes, though I am advised the recent regime change in Brazil was done by the US.",

If you consume many more calories than you burn you may be eating more than you need. If you consume a lot nutrient-poor foods, you may be getting too many calories but not enough of the nutrients your body needs and therefore you will crave more. It's helpful to slow down when you eat, chew more, and be mindful of your body signals. If you no longer feel physical hunger (different than craving a certain flavor, texture) then stop eating. Is eating cow more ethical than eating dog? Why? How many eggs should I eat each day? Why do people eat more than what is healthy? How do we know we eat enough daily for what our body needs? Should I still eat avocados even if I am mildly allergic to them? Is it still good for me or is it more harm than good? You will gain fat. If you are not gaining fat, then you are not eclipsing your needs. However, you could gain fat eating a diet high in sugar and refined carbohydrates, even if the total calories consumed is proper for your metabolic needs. Just like you can exceed your metabolic needs, yet still get leaner by eating a diet high in protein and fat and low in carbs. Medications can also cause you to add fat weight even on what would normally be a caloric deficit diet. Your body is not a machine so there are a lot of variable besides the thermal energy contained in any one food. But bottom line is, if you\u2019re not putting on fat weight, you are not eating too much. If you\u2019re  increasing  in weight, you\u2019re eating  more  than you need to stay at your current weight. And conversely: If you\u2019re  decreasing  in weight, you\u2019re eating  less  than you need to stay at your current weight. Your current weight  may not be ideal  for you though (you need to seek medical advice about what your ideal weight or range is). Of course, what you then do depends on whether you need to  increase your weight  (eat more calories per day than you need to maintain your current weight) or  decrease your weight  (eat less calories per day than you need to maintain your current weight). The above is about the principles - you see a qualified health professional for detailed advice. If you are psychically hungry, then you should eat more. If you are full and craving, say for ice cream, then you should adjust your diet. Sugar is the evil by your ear murmuring about all the false signals.

Since our two nation theory has failed & Pakistan is now a failed state and a threat to global security an... What was the Dabhol case at the ICJ that India lost to Enron ? Pakistan is struggling to balance her national and international forces. Both pulling the nation in opposite directions. National politics demands hardcore and support for fundamentalists whereas the international pressure today is anti to these. China is en-cashing the situation and grabbing as much as she can from Pakistan. To the extent China has put her own credibility at UN at stake by using Veto in favour of terrorism against India to support Pakistan. Elected Govt in Pakistan has the least authority in comparison to her Military, ISI and fundamentalists turned terror organisations. In the case of Jadhav The Pakistan Govt will put everything to seek his execution and to withhold the sentence of the Military Court. Thus Military authorities in Pakistan will save their reputation in the eyes of the public for a sentence they all know was manipulated and vicious. China will now try to seek Indian favour for his project by trade off in Jadhav case where it may ask Pakistan Military to give up its demand of executing Jadhav. India should resist that. Pakistan and China will both burn their fingers at the International arena. Pakistan as rogue nation and China as her friend and gloves in hand.",

        "a": "Both Treks have their unique identities. Deorital-Chandrashila Trek If Bird watching, Flora/Fauna and great summit views is what you resonate too then Deorital- Chandrashila Trek should be your pick. This 6 day trek categorises itself in the Easy - Medium grade with a altitude of \u2013 12,083 feet-Chandrashila Peak , \u2013and 7,841 feet- Deorital Peak with a approx trekking distance of 30kms . The Tunganath Temple~which is also the worlds highest Lord Shiva Temple is enroute this trrek. You will also savour views of Bandarpoonch peak, Kedar peak and Chaukhamba peak . Pangarchulla Trek The Pangarchulla peak trek is a 6 day adventure. If Snow Peaks and Trails is your thing, then PangarChulla will satisfy your senses. This can be a wee bit diffficult, since its a snow trek one might want to check the strength, Stamina and endurance before running the summit, hence the trek is graded from medium to difficult. The Summit is at 14,700 feet with a approx. trekking distance of 35 Kms. Dronagiri, Hathi, Parvat, Gori Parvat ,Nanda Devi peak and Kalanka and Chang Bang are some of the peaks which you could witness along the way. So here is my advise: If you have previous trek experience and would like to take up a challenge this season then opt for the Pangarchulla trek. off course not to mention you have to be at the top of your game since this trek will test your endurance. If you want to put in less effort then Deorital-Chandrashila is what you should opt for. Hope this helps! How should I plan a trip of few days to Goa?

        "a": "This is something what I believe \u2013 There is a god who has created the universe and earth. It has also created us and all other organisms. Why?? Most of the answers comes from different Religious Structure (Hinduism,Islam,Christianity etc\u2026). Religion are very strong pillars of humanity. These exists from very longtime in regards to universe have kept human beings as groups. Generally these group have developed a common thinking and Leader.They develop culture, Literature, Social structure, a patterned communication system. All together a belief system and made us different from animal beings. This gave humanity the most important weapon for survival power of unity. Bigger the group more powerful were they. But individual had to agree to the beliefs of the group. This way individual and groups were making each other stronger. Still there were day to day problems which were not solved by religion or group. It required some brainwork and help from nature to solve it. Research and development \u2013this is called science. Invention. There can be instances where in Groups overpower a scientific invention to be motivated by their Leader(God). The seeds of the invention were sown by god in the inventors mind. So the credit goes to Leader(God). What I believe Religion/Group has helped Humanity to establish and Science has taken it forward. It is going good. The only challenge is different Religious groups at times get into clash in regards to superiority. Generally fight is about Whose God is real and strong and the irony is never in the history any god has came down to save humanity. The fight has stopped either one side is completely destroyed or mutual agreement. One thing that I am sure of God has no involvement in Religion and Science. I believe god has created this world. Lets look at the creation little closely in Earth. Living and non Living organism, Atmosphere, gravity etc. It is a beautiful and comfortable place. But no one can escape easily. A sort of a golden cage everything is available but you cannot escape except death. Every Living organism that takes birth has to die. Whatever healthy lifestyle they may have. Yes there is an term for individual organism. If you look closely there are 2 important cycles food cycle(Hunger is the most i-resistive feeling) and reproductive cycle(one of the strongest feeling is orgasm). Common to almost all organism. There are very strong and different emotions but most of them created by social structures. The other point that one has to focus is on the gender. There are specifically 2 genders male and female present in almost all the organisms. For a new life to be created both the gender have to meet. Feeling wise orgasm and Parental love will be at the top. Orgasm so that organism can reproduce and parental love because without that infants who are weak cannot be raised or taken care off non selfishly. After birth organisms growth is important so we feel hungry and eat. So what I feel is we are all part of an invisible food cycle we are just like crop reproduced to be eaten. Eaten by our creator. Earth is just like a beautiful farm. So how do we are eaten or what part of our body is eaten in my view Soul is eaten. Just like we wait for a fruit to ripen and then we eat that similarly our creator waits the organism to gets mature and then eats it ripen soul. May be our ancestors were aware of this that is the reason sacrifices and offerings were done to gods. Its always seems God is never interested in what we are doing \u2013 no involvement in good or bad. His presence is observed only when world is about to end \u2013 injustice is prevailing \u2013 People are killing each other \u2013 there is a big chance God\u2019s source of food might get exhausted. They come to earth as avatar . So we are just a kind of crop upon death we are harvested. I also believe apart from God somebody else accompanies us as well. The other being is more helpful than god. So whatever we do in are daily life \u2013 impacts our soul gives it an experience. May be good deeds makes it more tastier and bad deeds makes it less tastier. Ageing of soul also adds the taste. Certainly there is some connection. As we are moving ahead in time we are going far away from truth. May be our ancestors knew this exactly. god is not perfect so its creation is not perfect the only purpose to human life is to become a healthy fruit. We are just carrying a soul and passing time in this world to get ripen. What would life be like if all humans were 1000 ft tall? What makes you want to give up on humanity? Which human being in the world is happy? What is reason behind human life or why are we born into this world? Does it only serves to be born, live and die? Or there is some other reas... What is important in life? Human beings are Supreme Creation of God Almighty and need to Fully connected to God Almighty. It's only possible through \u201cSelf Realization\u201d. \u201cSelf Realization\u201d is Connection of God Almighty which is Only possible in \u201cSahajayoga Meditation\u201d It means purification of all our Mind, attention, heart, \u201cPlexues and veins\u201d which is called \u201cChakra and Nadis\u201d in ancient time. \u201cSelf Realization\u201d is happening process not just ritual thing. Jesus Christ gave \u201cBaptism\u201d to his 12 followers but in church they all doing Ritual in the name of \u201cBaptism\u201d. In Hindu Holy Book \u201cShri Bhawat Gita\u201d \u201cShri Krishna said human beings need to get \u201cSthith Pragya\u201d state, Awakening of Kundalini and have full connection with God Almighty. But In Temple No Priest knows about Holy Awakening. Profit Muhammed said \u201cWhen human have connection with \u201cRuhani\u201d Power of Allah(God Almighty) their hands will speak means they will know absolute Truth and Falsehood in their Subtle human being system. All the Pure and Holy Places emits \u201cCool Breeze=Chaitanya Lahari=Ruhani Flow\u201d which is Power of \u201cHoly Spirit=Shri AdiShakti\u201d. Gautham Buddha said \u201cMaaitreya\u201d means 3 powers of God All mighty will come. She is Shri Adi Shakti not male Buddha as bhudist change it in male form\u201cMaitreya\u201d. Mostly Fake Guru Masters in India and world are Mesmerized Innocent people's in the name of Spirituality and Awakening of Kundalini and damaging their Subtle System of body. The moral of Story is Stay in balance through \u201cSelf Realization\u201d and leave all habits which harm's our Body, Mind, Attention. In Sahajayoga, all over the world No one taking \u201cTabecco products and Alcohol\u201d. Honest and Faithful people's. All over the world \u201cDoctor's get MD degree in research of Sahajayoga. Just need to do 10\u201315Minute Morning and Evening Meditation to balance our Subtle System through \u201cSelf Realisation\u201dKundalini Awakening\u201d. It's Free for All, No membership. All Natural things comes free. Any kind of disease can cure through Sahajayoga Meditation. Just need to have proper diet, simple Medication and honestly do Sahajayoga any kind of disease will be cure. Thanks for all who are reading this. Stay Blissful :)) I my point of view.. Human beings born in this world to learn and to grow because o think there is no other place from where we learn in such a practical manner but sometimes it is very hard to learn something because sometimes god teachers us in a very difficult way.,something we loss, something we win but eventually god give us satisfaction.",

What do I do in a two hour break between paper 1 and paper 2 of JEE Advanced? How tough is the JEE Advance paper? Cheating in any exam, be it a competitive or graduation exams, is considered an academic dishonesty. Why would you cheat? Study for gaining knowledge and understanding and not for snatching the success away. I strongly advise you to prepare well for it. If it takes 4 years, let it be because once you clear it by your own merit, the satisfaction and worthiness you get is precious. It isnt easy to crack mains and give advanced, it takes lot of hardwork and effort. As you already cracked jee mains, i guess you are a hardworker, so believe your hardwork and give your best and dont cheat.

Can you hack a phone if you have their wifi saved? First isolate the phone from network resources both mobile and wifi. Then check for malware and spyware on the device. If in doubt use your carrier to help you wipe the phone. There is Anti-virus and anti-malware software for Android and Windows phones; I like Bit Defender. When you are on someone else\u2019s WiFI they are within their rights to look at everything you do while on the network. Get a VPN service to encrypt the data as it leaves your phone; I like Private Internet Access or PIA. PIA can be paid any number of ways, including walmart gift cards. PIA also doesnt keep traffic records for more tha nfifteen minutes and they dont keep names either. No payment info is kept. In short PIA cant tell on you becuase they dont know It all depends on how their network is setup and if they felt the need to do so. Chances are they will never have the need to do this and even if they thought you were being unsafe or putting others at risk they would likely inform the appropriate authorities instead. But given the 1/1000000 chances they decide to \u201chack \u201c your phone it depends on how their network is setup to cache data and what kind of device you have. If you have an iPhone and you always use secure https versions of sites and or a VPN your pretty safe because the list of people who can beat the 2FA for iCloud and such is a very short list. However if you have an android device it's a whole new kettle of fish. This is because there are numerous publicly Available resources that go into great detail about exploits for the android OS in which case they can use these to \u201cbug\u201d your phone and snoop around.

Doing the duty, determined by (one\u2019s) nature, one does not incur sin.\u201d Gita  interpreters generally relate this verse to the battle between Pandavas and Kauravas, where Arjuna is waging an inner battle with the predicament of killing his cousins, and Krishna advises him to carry out the execution because it is his duty, no matter the unsavoury deeds that need to be carried out to fulfil his  dharma . Honestly, I have always considered this to be a polarised interpretation oriented towards the  good  people. But, what of those elements of society that are  bad ?  Gita  after all applies to all human beings, right? Popular opinion of Gita notwithstanding, I think this book, among many other things, does give us a great insight into the workings of humankind. Here\u2019s what I believe: But before I proceed any further, let\u2019s just replace  good  and  bad  with  da  and  ja,  irrespectively .  People that are  da  natured, follow the life and duties that come with their nature.  Da -natured people maybe, for example, believe that creating is their duty, and hence  create  out of what is available around them. This sometimes is not always beneficial to nature\u2019s order. But because it is their duty to create, they do it and thereby do not attract the wrath of karma.  Ja -natured people may believe that destroying is their duty and hence carry out that which they think helps them fulfil their  dharma . And sometimes, this is beneficial to nature\u2019s order. But this is an oversimplification.  Good  and  bad  are just polarities. Good people are polarised in a certain way and Bad people are polarised in another. In the end, everyone is carrying out duties according to their nature. But, the fabric of human  nature  is far more complex than just a simple single-ply weaving of good and bad. Alas, you tell me how you feel about yourself, and I can assure you \u201cbad people\u201d feel the same way about themselves too. P.S.: I\u2019m an agnostic. I believe in knowledge and I\u2019m open to any form of wisdom. I'm good at making people feel bad about themselves. How can I use this in a good way? What are the small things you can do to have a good life? How do you feel about people who are bad at keeping in touch? Why do I feel joy when I see people suffering? Why don't I feel bad about it? Do most people feel bad about lying? Haha i hope you\u2019re not asking me this because you think i am a bad person, i really am not that bad. Anyway, thanks for asking! I don\u2019t know what is your criteria of judging whether a person is good or bad. But if you think about it the person being called \u2018bad\u2019 doesn\u2019t probably know he is doing bad things (except mafias and dons obviously). For him what he is doing is his choice and we always try to make the right choices for ourselves right? So to conclude, like every other human being that person loves himself and thinks he is making the right choice. Peace! Oh well.. let me say it in this way - Most of them are thinking very highly about them. Why? Lets sort it out first of all. Good and Bad- is variable, and depends on the character of the person who judge, something which will good in my eyes will be bad in other peoples eyes. So we cant generally call someone as good people or bad people. That is the philosophical side. .Lets get into practical side, we call bad people for people who do illegal activities, rapist, corrupted people , selfish people list goes on and on... Now thinking process of all of them will be different. What makes them do those is mainly because the lack of sense of morality. which we usually get from our parents school friends. Even if all these are good, some people with a weak character, who can get manipulated easily- can meet their evil partner in any point of their time. So its more like a destiny. Now for person with less sense of morality - they dont understand what is good and what is bad. Their thinking process travels in different ways. Say for eg if you ask a person who take bribe why do they do that he may possibly answer- \u201cwhy should i? if you are smart enough you will make money, its not my mistake that you makes less money than me. I pity you. Politicians, ministers, legal system, everyone make money in this country, and why should only i be poor and pay them money which i use for my purposes. \u201c - see, here they actually think you are stupid and they are smart, they know how to live in society . Now lets go to another extreme - to a person who usually do crime ( most of them have a history of getting abused from parents or society in their childhood ) - they will be more having a revenge attitude. This also applies to people who cheat, people who kill, people who rape- Nobody cared for them, so now they are not obligated to care for anybody. and this is society- everyone live their life as their own hero. Nobody think of themselves as a villain. There is a hope that once they get a setback- morality may rise in them. For some people this will never happen. I know a person who took a lot of illegal money became a billionaire and his only daughter died in a fire accident which made him think of his own karma. To live a happy world- think that nobody can be completely good or completely bad. There is goodness in everybody. Some get chance to live their life in moral way- some cant depending on their situations and mostly their mentality. Dont loose hope on Humanity because of it. A fragile sence of iscolated self covered by fuck loads of fear draped in anger wrapped with with a layer of false ego tied in a pretty ribbon of pride if they accomplish a goal to justify thier shittyness.",

Regardless, body weight training is a great option. Squats, walking lunges, reverse lunges, sprints, pistol squats, shrimp squats. Even plyometrics - Squat jumps, lunge jumps, broad jumps and the like. The problem is, generally, external resistance is required eventually, especially for the legs. Now, as far as external resistance goes you certainly don\u2019t need any specific gym equipment. A sandbag is an incredible at home option. Grab a duffel bag, a postal bag, military bag or a professionally made bag and load it up with some sand. You not have yourself a cheap, versatile peace of equipment that you can keep adding weight to as you progress. I could go on and on about sandbag training and it\u2019s benefits for days, so if you\u2019re interested, let me know and I\u2019ll happily go on. Other options are a little more unusual, but insanely effective. I\u2019ve personally utilised stones, rocks, logs and training partners as resistance for a number of years with myself and my athletes with great success. Training need not be limited by a lack of \u201cgym equipment\u201d. Think outside the box and the world can become your gym! Can I build muscle without exercise? Can you build muscle without weightlifting? How can I improve my muscles without using equipment? Can I build muscle without bulking? How do I get really big muscles at home without gym equipment? Getting lean muscles  is about working out, but  most of all about cutting fat  so your  muscles pop out . When  losing   weight   80% is nutrition and 20% physical activity . Having said that, with a  proper nutrition you can definitely achieve your goal . Go on a  calorie deficit . The best working diet, is the one you  build for yourself . So if you want to start, here are  some steps  you could start with. First step , setting you goal: Lose weight, gain weight, maintain weight. Step two , how are you going to reach your objective?  Dieting   solely  or adding  physical   exercise Third   step , according to how you decided to reach your goal, use an  online calculator  to calculate what  calorie   intake  you should have per day. I use this one  Calorie Calculator Third and a half step , if you really want to be very rigurous about the diet, you should  calculate your macros  intake per day ( protein ,  carbs ,  fats ) it will take you a while but once you get used to it, it gets much easier. Fourth   step , be creative, start with something simple, like  3   meals + 2 snacks  and change it, and change it, and change it until it fits you and your program best. No doctor or nutritionist  will ever be able to give you a better diet than the one you  craft   yourself . Having made a balanced diet, all you need is some regular  physical exercise ,  like 3\u20135   times a week , and you should be doing  weight training  so you  keep your muscular mass while losing fat. Good luck! You use bodyweight exercises, which require no additional equipment. You do plenty of the following. Pushups Dips Burpees Jump Squats Lunges And all the variations that come with these types of exercises. And - if you\u2019re skinny, you need to be eating. A lot. Muscle doesn\u2019t grow out of thin air - no matter how much you exercise and push your body - you need actual raw material to build muscle, and that\u2019s where the calories through food come in. I\u2019ve put together a list of the 20 best body weight exercises to build muscle, you can check it out here. The 20 Best Body-Weight Exercises For Building Muscle And as a skinny guy who wants to grow muscle, you should read this article for the exact 5 things you have to focus on to get bigger. To Build Muscle, Focus On These 5 Things Good luck. If you\u2019re interested in strength training then try working out like a  Viking! The Viking Method is a functional training method, that uses high intensity bodyweight exercises to strip fat and help build a lean athletic physique. The basis for the programme is inspired by the \u201ctoughness\u201d Scandinavians have developed after surviving centuries of isolation, cold, enormous volcanic eruptions. It burns fat, increases performance, and boosts your metabolism faster than many fitness programs out there. You can find out more about the Viking Method  here.",

        "a": "The easiest was probably the  1970 World Cup final when Brazil thrashed Italy 4\u20131. Italy actually possessed some great players in Rivera, Mazzola, and Facchetti who made up the great sides of Inter and AC Milan of the 1960s. However, 1970 Brazil is widely regarded as the greatest team of all time and they showed it with the talents of Rivelino, Pele, Carlos Alberto, Gerson, and Tosta. The hardest might have been  West Germany 3\u20132 over Hungary in 1954. Hungary were seen as the best team around and contained the likes of Puskas, Kocsis, and Czibor. The heavy favorites saw an unlikely West German side who they put 8 past in the Group Stage. Hungary took a 2\u20130 lead at first, but Morlock and Rahn pegged back the Hungarians for a 3\u20132 victory. Who will win the Germany vs Argentina FIFA World Cup final? Why? Which team will win the 2018 World Cup? Will it be ever possible for India to win a FIFA World Cup? How can I help India to win FIFA World Cup 2022? Why did Brazil lose to Germany in the 2014 World Cup semifinal? Easiest one, either Brazil - Sweden in 1958 (5\u20132) or Brazil - Italy in 1970 (4\u20131) Brazil were at the top of the game in those days. It was really, really, really hard to beat them. And they played such amazing football. Were all but unstoppable. Neither Sweden nor Italy ever really stood a chance. Toughest winning, I\u2019d go with Germany - Hungary in 1954 (3\u20132). Hungary was up 2\u20130 in less than 10 minutes, and were already dominating the match. They had a fantastic team, the mighty magyars, having gone unbeaten for some ridiculous 40 odd games. But soon after, Germany scored twice and levelled the game. In the 80th odd minute, Germany was ahead. It was dubbed the Miracle of Bern, since there was no way Hungary could ever lose to Germany, having previously beat them 8\u20133 in the group round. But they lost. I would have said the '58 final between Brazil and Sweeden was the easiest win, Sweden were the host nation and although they got an early lead they were defeated 5-2 (I think it may even be the highest scoring of all time, Brazil dominated the match opening up to a lead of 4-1. As for the toughest win I would agree the '94 match was very close and two very good teams of the times. Not to mention Baggio's missed penalty kick being likened to Diana Ross' prophetic opening ceremony missed penalty kick. Although I would say the cup final of '66 could equally have been a hard one had the cross bar of god not happened, England's 4th goal may never have happened and before that fortuitous goal decision the teams were very, very even - not that I would want to tarnish our one and only moment of glory but we were incredibly lucky that day. But ever since? well, incredibly unlucky or just plain bad - I guess it's Karma ;) Three examples spring to mind in terms of easiest 1958\u00a0 Sweden 2\u20135 Brazil 1970\u00a0 Brazil 4\u20131\u00a0 Italy 1998\u00a0 France 3\u20130 Brazil In terms of the hardest probably the two victories via penalty shoot out Brazil over Italy in 1994 and Italy over France in 2006.",

I had moved to Mumbai for a short while and needed to get another phone (small ans simple). My phone had a single sim slot only.  I walked up to a mobile shop near Marol naka. It was just off the road in a small shop with a 2 kW meter attached to the wall. I told him he should get solar (with a few batteries and grid-tied inverter) just to run a few LEDs and 2 ceiling fans during the day. He told me it would cost a gazillion rupees. I explained the whole \u201cfree ka energy\u201d funda. He did not know it was free after the initial costs. He may or may not have converted to solar energy, I did not re-visit. But, the thing is that the majority of population in India do not have the information to take the step. It\u2019s like owning a specific car. Many people have done that, and people relate to them and buy the car. The trend is changing, though. People have just started to get the hang of it, get to know it better.  Well informed people who have the means to get solar, do it. But, the numbers are not significant. This is partly due to the initial cost issues or due to un-availability of equipment readily and/or due to regulations. Why are solar panels so inefficient?

        "a": "It's because your body only has one response to stress. The release of adrenaline. When it does this certain things happen to our bodies. Stored glycogen is converted into glucose for quick bursts of energy, blood vessels dilate, heart rate and respiration increases, and blood is shunted away from non essential systems (such as your digestive tract) so that you can more effectively fight or flee. Additionally some people react to a surge of adrenaline by vomiting, there are a couple of possible reasons. First you rid yourself of a couple of pounds of deadweight (remember your digestive tract is shut down) so you move more effectively. Second, while your reaction to adrenaline is almost immediate, it's effects can take many hours to wear off, in that time, with digestion shut down, food could literally spoil in your gut. So you vomit to prevent illness. You just happen to be one of the many who react that way to adrenaline so nausea is your reward. Like I said that is its one stress reaction. It doesn't matter if it is a physical threat, emotional turmoil, or just extreme hunger adrenaline is your body's go to response. Interestingly methamphetamines fill the same receptors as adrenaline, and have the same results. Which include that same nausea. There is a caveat though. You can only be continuously stressed for so long before your body starts to become less sensitive to the effects (of adrenaline or methamphetamines). It likely wont happen witb hunger, but other more constant strain? Almost certainly going to happen. How come I feel so hungry but I really don't want to eat? If I'm not hungry when I wake up in the morning, should I eat breakfast anyway? I am really hungry in the night; with no food and no money. I'm not able to sleep on an empty stomach. How do I manage? Why do I never feel hungry? How can I feel full even when I\u2019m hungry? This happens to me too sometimes. While I can't tell u why it happens, I can tell u how to prevent it. (1) make sure that you eat dinner. Don't under-eat or eat too early. Eat at ur usual time and don't have a snack too late at night (2) drink juice in the morning before you eat anything. This works best if you drink milk, juice, a protein shake, anything other than water after you brish your teeth and ideally about a half hour before you eat breakfast. Hope this helps!",

So that is the first thing. The second thing is we're talking about Intel here. I would imagine a company like intel would require a bachelors degree in electrical engineering from an accredited university in order to work as an EE.

We need a leader that is totally committed to serving the people and achieving a worthwhile dream. Without commitment, it will be hard to build an effective and efficient team. 2. Character. The leader should be able to command admiration and respect. He need to be able to unite the people and help to harness their energy to build a better future. 3. Competence. The leader should have the knowledge, attitude, skills and habits to be able to direct, organise, manage and control the people. 4. Compassion.

The beauty of the movie lies in the spectacular way the story is told. Yes, Rajamouli has knocked it out of the square yet again. If \u2018The Beginning\u2019 gave you the glimpse of Mahishmathi- the kingdom, the second part focuses more on exploring the soul of its characters. Also, how the clash of principles can lead to some devastating results and shatter down of such a grand kingdom. Every expression of characters in the movie, even if it\u2019s a tear drop or a genuine smile is highlighted very smartly to catch hold of the sight of every viewer.

The much anticipated movie of the year. Why kattapa killed bahubali was the sole reason which forced a majority to watch that film. But after watching the film i would definitely say that it is not a big reason.The film is simply superb when it is viewed in the aspect of the storyline and vfx. But some of the fight sequences remained awkward!.It is my personal opinion. yes it is a must watch in a theatre!!! For d effects and sound!! No, haven\u2019t watched both parts.

Physicists are needed to further develop and test such machines, and to help people use them safely. The university I attneded offers such a master degree called  Master of Medical Radiation Physics. You should look into it and see if it suits your interests. You\u2019ll have to learn a lot of heavy physics, including quantum mechanics to do it, so I wouldn\u2019t take it too lightly. Can I use plain logic in physics as it is in math? Do physicists also think quantum physics weird or is it only lay people? Can you solve complex math or physics problems only by using intuition? Which math concepts mostly used in physics? What are some cool physics tricks? A physics professor or researcher? Or did you mean exclusively a medical doctor? You don\u2019t think physicists help people? Who do you think invented x-rays? You don\u2019t have to be a medical doctor to help people. Don\u2019t forget engineers, either. We build things that help people all the time, and use physics and math to do it. My best educated guess would probably be an orthopedic surgeon, or the closely related but different specialty of prosthetic surgeon. They\u2019re as much mechanical engineers as they are surgeons; yes, they need to know anatomy, but their end goal is usually to correct, repair and/or replace portions of the human skeleton to provide useful function. Like any procedure involving the human body, each one is slightly different, and requires the surgeon to be confident that their \u201cdesign\u201d for the solution to the problem will allow acceptable function of the arm, leg, spine, skull, whatever is broken, misshapen or missing.

        "a": "Examples of jobs held by people with Master's degrees in Social Work (MSW), whom I personally know, in the local area, are as follows: Dept. Of Human Resources investigator or case worker Director of a supervised visitation program in a child abuse and neglect prevention not-for-profit org, who also supervises visits with non-custodial parents/children, and teaches parenting classes, Executive Director of same program for child well being Mental health counselor for a county mental health center HIV/AIDS case manager in a county medical clinic Court liasion mental health counselor (determines whether certain offenders are ok for jail or need mental health incarceration) Juvenile offender counselor and service coordinator at the county juvenile court A hospital social worker who coordinates patient discharge services A Community Development degree would NOT  qualify  a person for any of the above jobs. A degree in community development encompasses  larger concerns  to do with the five basic institutions of society, whereas the fields listed above have a more narrow scope. The jobs above typically involve working  directly  with  one   person -client in need at a time, or with  small groups , as in the class setting, as well as with professionals and others involved in helping that one person or group. (In the case of the executive director position, a person takes on administrative duties which expands the scope of a job.) MSW's typically get their undergraduate degree in psychology or sociology. Community Development is a newer field, a degree available at the bachelor's level, and concerned with a  wider scope  than what one client needs or a group of clients need. Five basic social institutions, family, government, economy, education and religion ask a community development specialist how to address concerns of an  entire city , for instance. A person with this degree typically goes on to get their master's degree in urban planning. You would typically NOT provide  direct services . I was considering getting my Bachelor's in Community Development, through a design-your-own-degree adult studies program, because a degree in community development was not offered at the time, 25 years ago. That is how new the field is, relative to the field of social work. It is now offered at that same university. Master's degrees in urban planning were not offered at one of three local universities back then, also indicating that field's relative newness. (I am not updated on the local availability of urban planning degrees.) I would say that, to an extent, the world knows exactly what to do with a social worker, and not so much what to do with a Community Development specialist/urban planner. Not that that should deter you, but it does mean fewer available jobs. (Look around on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website for extra help.) I always wonder why urban planning know how isn't something we demand of our local city council members and other elected officials. Better community design and health can support individual concerns. What is the difference between social service and social work? What are the definitions of community development and sustainable community development? Are they the same? If not, what are the differences? How do I get a fund for social work in a developing country? Can a community develop without money? Which master's degree in social work should I opt for? What are the different types of the degree? Social work is more exact and specialized. Community development is a little bit social work, a little bit architect, a little bit developer, a little bit politician, a little bit organizer, a little bit researcher. If you\u2019re interested in urban planning and organization heading, community development\u2019s the better way. For direct patient care, social work\u2019s your best bet. I'm not a community development student so take that into consideration. Social Workers receive training in how to work with individuals, communities and groups including how to advocate, assess needs and build community organizations in addition to therapy and Mental Health. It is an applied field of practice with job titles ranging from \u201cTherapist\u201d to Policy Analyst to Community Organizer. Community Development is more zoomed out, it focuses specifically on how to work with large groups and understand their needs. Less focus is put on advocating for change with large groups, than on building resources in organizations that let you. If you specifically want to work on a community level, especially in a developing nation or international environment, Community Development is the way to go. If you want to potentially work with individuals or ever be a mental health professional then Social Work would be the selection. Social workers do case managment and start their intervention strategies and programs from the individual needs of clients. Community Workers start fron the perspective of social capacity/capital/resilience and then seek to meet the needs of individuals. Community Development is a macro process while Social workers may adopt community development strategies they do so because of individual client need rather than a general broader community need. Social Work has also developed a professional standard of Degree Qualifications required to be a registered Social Worker while Community Development workers as a proffession have not made Degree Qualifications a requirement a Diploma is adequate. This distinction also means most social workers are paid more than community Development workers. Community development comes under social work. It is a method of social work. Social work is done in three way; case work (considering individuals ), group work and community development. It just focuses on the betterment of the community whereas social work sees for the society altogether, working on its every element that hampering its progress.",

You will have to let someone you know, because you\u2019re going to have a first time eventually. One of the things women tend to find unattractive is when men try to have false confidence. If you haven\u2019t done something before, but try to pretend like you have, women will often see right through it. Instead, own the fact that you haven\u2019t done it before, and let them offer assistance and advice. The overwhelming majority of women have no issue being with a man who hasn\u2019t had sex before, and are happy to tell you what works for them. So simply listen up, do what they tell you, and you\u2019ll be fine. I enjoy performing oral sex on my girlfriend, but she always gets wet too quickly. After that, liquid comes from her vagina, causing her vagin... Do most heterosexual men enjoy giving cunnilingus? Why or why not? Do women like cunnilingus? Why, why not? How do I give great oral sex? What are some tips for performing oral sex on women? \u201cWhat's the best way to practice cunnilingus?\u201d This is rather tricky to practice without a live partner. The main reason is that every woman is different and you need to take your queues from her responses. I have heard many times that the best way to perform cunnilingus is to trace the alphabet with the tip of your tongue. While I do believe this is a good exercise for your tongue, I am not convinced it is the best way to perform on a partner. If you can bring yourself to talking to your partner, I would recommend telling her you that your goal is her pleasure and maybe she could provide feedback or help on what works for her. I am pretty sure this will get you lots of \u201cpoints\u201d and she will be impressed. If you cannot talk to her, start with the alphabet moving slowly and paying close attention to her responses. The classic rookie mistake is to go straight for her clitoris with aggressive pressure. While I understand there are women who may prefer this method, I am pretty sure that starting gently and slowly will be a better bet. The clitoris will likely \u201chide\u201d under the hood. You do not have to work on it directly. As she is more and more stimulated, it will respond by making itself more accessible. Give it some direct attention, then move away a bit. Repeat while noting her responses. Most of all, enjoy that time. It is a huge turn on to give pleasure to your partner. Revel in the experience. -Doug",

And this is relatively impossible for the next 2 to 5 years for any other movie to achieve this target. Now let's look at Salman Khan\u2019s latest films' total collections. Sultan - 584 crores Bhajrangi Bhaijaan- 626 crores Kick - 400 crores Prem ratan dhan payo - 400 crores Tube light - has a decent expection. Even if the film Tube light is going to be an awesome film, it won't break Baahabali's record. Not because Salman is incapable but because Baahubali has set a very huge record to break.",

        "a": "The F-35 wasn\u2019t designed specifically for VTOL / STOL: There are 3 variants of the F-35; the F-35A, F-35B and F-35C: While they look very similar, their aerodynamics and methods of landing are less so. The top and first version, the F-35A, is the model that the Air Force and most F-35 users will operate - it\u2019ll make up around 70\u201380% of all F-35s built. It is the standard variant, it cannot perform STOVL / VTOL (it can only use runways like a normal fighter), but it costs the least of all 3 variants, can pull 9Gs (more than the other variants) and accelerates the fastest. It\u2019s designed to primarily replace the F-16 for the US Air Force. The second / middle version is the F-35B and it is the one that is capable of STOVL (Short Take Off, Vertical Landing). It has the canopy truncated, slightly shorter weapon bays and additional bulk behind the cockpit so that it can fit a vertical lift fan, which is mechanically powered by the main (rear) jet engine. It\u2019s being bought by the US Marine Corps, the British Royal Air Force / Navy and Italian Air Force, who will fly it off of LHDs / LHAs (aircraft carriers that don\u2019t have catapults / are designed for helicopters and Harriers). Israel and Singapore are also considering buying it (though for now Israel is buying / flying A models). The B variant has about 2/3 the range of the A variant, can only pull 7Gs and can\u2019t carry 2000lb bombs internally like the A and C variant. It\u2019s designed to replace the Harrier. The third / bottom version is the F-35C and it is designed solely for use by the US Navy on their supercarriers that use a catapult and arresting gear. It\u2019s basically an A variant but with bigger wings and tail surfaces that allow it to fly with more control at low airspeeds, as well as a reinforced landing gear and stronger tail hook. It has a tiny bit more range than the A variant but otherwise has the same weapons load capability and can only pull 7.5G. It\u2019s designed to replace the F/A-18C/D Hornet (not Super Hornet). The reason that the Air Force chose to be part of the F-35\u2019s development is because there were potential cost-savings to be had by having a lot of customers (Air Force, Marines, Navy, other nations) buy variants of the same plane - instead of designing multiple radars, infrared sensors, cockpits, engines, etc, you can just design one type of each, splitting the R&D cost across multiple customers. Instead of having to have multiple factories produce multiple different structural components, you just have one, etc. In the end, not all of those cost savings were achieved; in fact, the program went way over budget and about 30% of the airframe structure between the 3 variants is unique, 40% are \u2018cousin\u2019 components that only share some of the same manufacturing processes and only about 30% is common. Still, because of the large customer base and because of the partial commonality (especially when it comes to the expensive stuff like electronics and engine) it is fairly cheap compared to its competition - it\u2019s $95m today and set to be $79 million by 2020; roughly on par with previous generation US fighters and cheaper than some foreign jets like the Rafale and Typhoon. Despite this, it\u2019s a 5th generation fighter like the F-22 and has been able to achieve greater than 20:1 kill ratios against F-15s and F-16s while handicapped with unfinished combat computer software, and while primarily being tasked with taking out ground targets / enemy SAM sites at exercises like Red Flag.",

        "a": "Yes, it does. Though the speed of light in vacuum is highest, being equal to 299,792,458 m/s, it changes as per the medium. This is analogous to \u201cYou run faster on land than swim in water\u201d. The ratio of velocity of light in vacuum to that in a specific medium is given by the quantity called refractive index : [math]n = \\dfrac{c}{v}[/math] (And this is always greater than 1) And that concludes the answer to your question. But there comes a new one: If the speed of light decreases in a medium, then is \u201cFaster Than Light\u201d Phenomena possible in that particular medium? Contrary to what is made famous that nothing can travel faster than light, the answer to the above question is a \u201cYES\u201d. Thus, Faster Than Light travel is possible in certain media. Don\u2019t believe me : Check out  Cherenkov radiation . Electrons travelling faster than light in these reactors produce a beautiful blue glow, termed as Cherenkov Radiation. Here\u2019s a video of Cherenkov Radiation from YouTube: See how the beautiful blue light is emitted in the fluid (video is short, but still beautiful). SciShow Spac e has also got a nice video talking about Cherenkov Radiation: See, the statement \u201cFaster than Light Phenomena is not possible\u201d is only valid for vacuum. Hope it helps. When light travels from one medium to another, its speed changes, why is this so? What's the fundamental reason why the speed of light cannot be broken? Is the speed of light a static, constant speed, or is it slowed when traveling in a medium? A light transfer from one medium to another brings a change in its velocity. Is this called an acceleration? If not, then why? Why does the speed of light change when the medium is changed? Light is an electromagnetic wave and always moves with a constant speed. It does not speeds up or slows down. The thing is the refractive index here is changed i.e the density of the molecules is changed. So, the photon particle have a higher chance of colliding another molecule due to which the energy is transferred to excite the electron and again emit light with the same frequency, this is where you observe a slow down in the speed of light propagating through a denser medium. Yes. Light is slowed down in transparent media such as air, water and glass. The ratio by which it is slowed is called the refractive index of the medium and is  usually  greater than one. * This was discovered by Jean Foucault in 1850. When people talk about \"the speed of light\" in a general context, they usually mean the speed of light in a vacuum. They also usually mean the speed as measured in an inertial frame. This vacuum-inertial speed is denoted  c . Yes it do , Let me firstly hit the history , firstly scientist thought just like sound , light wave\u2019s speed will increase when it will go from a rarer medium to a denser one , but to the contrary light\u2019s speed decrease when it go from a rarer medium to denser medium . You can see or check it out using experiment , take honey in transparent glass tumbler a let a beam of light come place your hand such that it pass behind from tumbler too and you will see it .",

        "a": "First off, great that you are interested! Climate change and sea level rise are both very important topics that deserve a lot more attention, before it is too late. My profile bio is mostly meant as an attempt at humor, although it (sadly) contains some truth. The Netherlands is the only country worldwide that is almost entirely below sea level (and adjacent to the sea!) and it is also ranked 30th on the list of most densily populated countries on Earth [1] . As you can see, this means there is great potential for disaster. Fortunately, we currently have a very effective water protection system, consisting of coastal and river dikes, dunes, controllable floodgates and new innovations such as Room for the River [2] . If I may show a bit of national pride: our Delta Works are world-famous and Dutch engineers are wanted all over the world for consultation on water protection. This is one of the main barriers: I am currently still a student but hope to contribute to worldwide water safety one day, perhaps in (Southeast) Asia. Anyway, back to the topic. Due to our country\u2019s geography and population density, we need the highest safety standards in the world. Our flood protection standards range from 1/2000 to 1/10,000 (for the primary flood defence). So, a flood is only allowed (statistically) to occur 1 in every 10,000 years. Comparatively, in the U.S. a standard of 1/100\u20131/200 is used and in Japan this is 1/100\u20131/500. However, while our system may be safe in the present situation, things are about to change. Here is the projected Sea Level Rise (SLR) by the IPCC: [3] There are many predictions like this. What they all have in common is a big uncertainty, you can see that the prediction for 2100 ranges from roughly +220mm to +500mm. Unfortunately, even in the \u201cbest case scenario\u201d it means we have a serious problem here in the Netherlands. This is what the Netherlands will look like with a SLR of 1 meter: (Source:  The Netherlands and UK ) While we can increase the height of our dikes (and we are actively doing so), there are limits to that (e.g. you also need to widen it and there is not always enough space or resources for that). It is also more challenging (and very expensive) to upgrade our other flood defences like the one from the first picture. So, we are facing a neverending battle against the sea. I chose my slightly pessimistic bio because of two reasons: Lots of people are denying or ignoring climate change, so it doesn\u2019t look like anything is going to change until it is too late. People in the Netherlands (including politicians) actually have too much confidence in our flood defences. Usually, action is taken only reactively (after a disaster) instead of proactively. Citizens even complain when a dike is upgraded because it \u201creduces the visibility from their homes\u201d. Unless we either halt climate change or increase public awareness, then there is a distinct possibility that my country will disappear in a few generations.

Can I self-publish a book on Kindle? How can I self-publish a book in the USA? After you are sure the book has been edited so the text flows and there are no or next-to-no typos, you can start the process. Every major e-retailer has decent instructions, but you need to be able to load a \u2018clean\u2019 copy. I suggest copying your text, putting it in a program such as Notepad (part of Windows) and then putting it back into Word. You add the formatting (bold, centering) back. You do this so the ebook doesn\u2019t have a mix of different fonts and such. You can try loading your Word file to Kindle or BN without going through these steps, but you\u2019ll end up spending more time fixing rogue problems than you would if you did it right the first time. If you go to the index on my blog, look under publishing and you\u2019ll see articles on formatting and related topics.

Orr Go to  http://www.kdp.amazon.com  and follow the instructions which are reasonably user-hostile but you can get there. You create a cover on the site or upload one; you upload your text in a Word or other format and fill in a few fields and you're done. That's not the problem. Now you have to market it! Well there\u2019s the crappy way, where you self edit, create a cover yourself, throw it on amazon and hope suckers buy it. Then there\u2019s the real way, where you hire a cover designer, an editor, a proofreader, and develop a marketing plan so that you can make sure your book will be successful. I don\u2019t understand how people who write books without editors can look at themselves in the mirror and say their books are worth any money, but it\u2019s possible to do it that way AND be very successful doing it. There are whole FB groups devoted to making books quickly and throwing them up online haphazardly to try to get a quick buck\u2026and that way works. I just couldn\u2019t do it that way.

        "a": "I\u2019m not sure I understand the question. Of course, children should be kept safe. From dangers that threaten their life, well being, etc. but which social setting are you referring to specifically? A social setting could be a party, church, walking down the street, really anything having to do with a group of people. Any social setting can turn unsafe when your life is being threatened. If you\u2019re referring to a social setting in which things are slowly becoming threatening, then remove them from the situation. Without any other details, that\u2019s the only answer I can give. But let\u2019s take a moment to define what is unsafe. Other than the obvious threats to life, well being and general freedoms, the only other thing you might be talking about is differences in opinion concerning society itself. A lot of this is going on in response to our new president\u2019s beliefs, announcements, and actions. Not to mention that society was messed up before all that. And I don\u2019t blame you. However, I urge you to really consider what you mean by unsafe. Again, if there is a threat to life, well being, or freedom, then that is a no brainer. And again, your question is not specific, so I do not know you or your circumstance, I can only guess and theorize what you might possibly mean by \u201cunsafe social setting.\u201d When I say consider your meaning of unsafe, in reference to a social situation, is make sure you\u2019re understanding where your fear comes from and how your response will affect your child as they develop their views of the social setting you\u2019re now deeming possibly \u201cunsafe.\u201d Allow me to be more specific. I\u2019m referring to race and religion. We often form ideas about other people based on labels that are associated with them. Some of these labels are harmless, many are not. And the views that you express, you\u2019re child will pick up on and adopt for a time. Note that I didn\u2019t say forever. You child, as they grow up and question things will decide if they\u2019ll keep them or change them. That is their decision later. But while they\u2019re young, you are the main influence in how they see the world. You might choose to view a gay couple as an \u201cunsafe\u201d social setting, because you have a fear that your child might pick it up and become gay later. You might choose to view a friend\u2019s religion as \u201cunsafe\u201d to be around your child. Since you\u2019re asking opinions of random strangers on the internet, I\u2019ll chip in and say that if you are considering the social setting as unsafe due to race, religion or sexual preferences of other people in said social setting, then that is extraordinarily sad. As someone who was raised in a particular religion (christian-baptist), around social settings that only exposed me to my own race (white), I found it difficult initially to be around people who were different. Difficult in both good and bad ways. In bad ways, it was a shock. I didn\u2019t know how to act around people who weren\u2019t the same, I was afraid of offending them unknowingly, and I was afraid of them for all the stereotypical reasons, in which my experiences growing up couldn\u2019t provide me with any help in overcoming them (and sometimes enforced those stereotypical beliefs). I was not raised specifically to be racist. However, because of my fear which was based on such a limited experience, without being intentional about it, I was being racist. I was judging others with the very limited knowledge that I had about people that I had never really been around. But this is what happens when we choose to create social settings in which we completely isolate ourselves and our family from anything remotely different. It\u2019s the same thing that cultists do. Isolation. You may not be ditching the modern world or moving to the mountains, but anybody in our modern society can control their children\u2019s environment - without much difficulty - to isolate them from \u201cunsafe\u201d differences. In my opinion, there was only one good thing that came out of my unintentional isolation growing up, and that was because despite the fact that I grew up within a particular religion - in which we went to church 2\u20133 times per week - I never resonated with this religion. I never, deep down, agreed with it or accepted it. I went along with it for sure, because I was a good christian little girl. But when I finally gave myself permission to stop going, to stop pretending to believe what they believed, I found within myself the freedom to drop a lot of other beliefs about other people and the world that were taught to me within the confines of that overall belief system. My point is, to really sit down and think. Are you using the word \u201cunsafe\u201d because your child is in danger? Then do something about it. Do it yesterday. Or are you using that word because the social setting lies just outside what your belief system is telling you is the truth? If so, I urge you to question whether you really believe in it, or do you believe it because it\u2019s familiar and it was taught to you? When is it safe for your children to own pets? Is it essential to keep children in hostels? What is Roblox? Is it safe for children? What are the ways to help keep children safe? How do I make sure my children and grandchildren keep our ethnic language? Raise them to be independent, realistic about the risks and trusted to deal with them. Firstly, our modern social setting isn't actually increasingly unsafe. If anything, it's getting safer in many ways - but we are being alerted to more dangers and taking more precautions as a result. As Warwick Cairns points out in his excellent book How to Live Dangerously, if you actually wanted your child abducted, you would have to leave them playing outside continuously for 7 years to have a realistic chance of it happening, and that rises to 70 years if you don't want them returned safely the next day. That's not to say that the dangers of online bullying and child abduction aren't real, but it's important not to blow them out of proportion. The risks of road accidents and childhood obesity are more prevalent and therefore more likely to cause lasting harm. Our son taught us a lesson when he was 4, misinterpreting an instruction to go and buy something in the shop next door to our flat and instead went into town on his own, returning safely (albeit with the wrong item clutched proudly in his hands). Since he was 11 we have allowed him to walk alone to and from events near where we live, sometimes up to 5 miles away along busy roads or through parks. Last summer we allowed him to make his own way from our flat to meet his grandmother, changing from local train to tube to intercity train on the way. No harm has befallen him. Our daughters will get similar privileges when they are mature enough for them. Based on current behaviour, this may be some time in their mid 30s, but when they are ready, we won't hold them back. To my mind, the best way to protect your children is to equip them to manage themselves and give them a realistic attitude to risk. I don\u2019t think it is increasingly unsafe, sorry. Yes, there\u2019s more ways for the world to be unsafe but the best defense is education, still and always.",

        "a": "Absolutely I\u2019m now 15, have a small YouTube channel that I made when I was  frikin 9 years old! I was just some kid who played video games and knew from a friend you could get 1$ per 1000 views. This motivated me to start this small adventure. I used to play the infamous \u201cRoblox\u201d with my friends and relatives when I knew that I could make my own games in it. I started learning some stuff in it and had in mind the idea that if I had a hard time doing something, then other people would too, so I made those videos to help them. Heck I even forgot about the money and just focused on likes and positive feedback! My first video got about 21 views, 10 likes and 2 dislikes, most of them from my friends. I did another one and almost instantly recorded the next just because I figured something new. This second one was massive (for me at least)! It now has more than 15k views and I got 50 subs off of it. I did another one because I also wanted to help people, not about Roblox this time, and it also got about the same numbers. I wanted to monetise this one to try it out, but I was too late. Still, I try to reply to every single comment (which aren't much xD) and am glad to this moment that people benefitted from them. I wanted to do lets plays this year, like Markiplier or Pewdiepie, given that I had 100 subs to start with, but I didn\u2019t have the proper hardware for the games and most of the recording was just nonstop lag. This video is unlisted btw. I also don\u2019t have enough time between school and personal interest -studying. The point is, if you want to make videos, try not to follow the trend. Be special, show who you are, or make videos that reflect what you want, not what you think people want. If I didn\u2019t have a hard time doing thos Roblox stuff, I never would have thought about YouTube in the first place. I also have a friend who really wants his channel to be big, but he has videos which are typical everyday tech videos. I still help him, but I know that he would never get big unless I advocated him or he thought of doing something unique. Just do your thing, even if your friends thought it was silly. People want different and new. Good luck! :) What is the best age to start a YouTube channel where you show your face, name and general location? How do I start a youtube channel in 200,000rs? Will my video get banned if I buy YouTube views? If I start a YouTube gaming channel at age 18, is that a good way to make money? Is it a bad time to start a YouTube channel? Yes. However, make sure that you have either a great personality or decent equipment (preferrably both) The first one should already make sense to you,as you know you won\u2019t watch a channel for long if you feel terribly bored after half a video. This is the most important aspect of keeping an audience. The second is for first impression. Doesn\u2019t matter if thumbnail or the first few moments of your video. Because a lot tend to not watch videos if, for example, the audio is only on the left side or there is a constant buzzing to be heard or the framerate is abysmal etc. In addition to that, make sure that your voice sounds right. Doesn\u2019t have to be mature sounding, just clear. Also learn to speak long monologues freely. This will help you to not rely on scripts that much, which means everything will sound more human.  OR You could learn to be really good at writing scripts, to the point of where it sounds exactly how you would sound like and it feels all natural.  (Again, preferrably both) Finally, make sure to actually put out your YouTube channel on social media, forums and so on, since you can\u2019t really get views if no one knows your videos exist. Have fun. Yes, why not. Experience is one of the most important factor of being a successful youtuber. Just make sure you have the time and resources; And make video about something that you love doing or else it\u2019ll become boring soon. Im not sure if it would be too late to answer, but definitely start a channel! I started mine when I was 14, and had nothing besides Windows Movie Maker to edit, and Mobizen to record. When you start off early, you can probably meet some kids who have different abilities, which can help you get things you need. I have Sony Vegas Pro 14 because of one friend, and Bandicam from channel income. Here are a few tips though for starting out (Which im using): Upload consistently (1 vid a day, 1 a week, 1 every 2 weeks, 1 a month. It doesn\u2019t matter as long as its consistent) Enjoy what your doing. Make videos 15 minutes or less (because people tend to have low patience. In other words, get straight to the point. Tell the viewer what you will be doing in the video, and then proceed to doing it) If you are NOT going to be talking, but doing captions instead, DONT USE WORDPAD, MEMOS OR ANYTHING ELSE TO TYPE ON during the video! It is super unprofessional and wastes the time of the viewer. Instead, go onto a basic video editor, like Movie Maker and insert a caption. Put it on the bottom of your video so that you are doing the activity while typing instead of doing one at a time. Make Funny videos. Who doesn\u2019t like a good laugh? If your making a video, make sure that someone else hasn\u2019t covered the topic your doing. The more videos in that topic the harder the competition. Don\u2019t forget to make an Adsense account to make money off your videos. No, as you: Didn\u2019t capitalize Android. Misspelled \u201cviews\u201d as \u201cveiws\u201d. Asked this question on Quora. But seriously though, if you are interested in those things, have time to make regular videos (as teens tend to abandon their channel in less than two months) and understand the potential risk of your personal information on the internet, you really should make a channel. It is a good experience to research more things for the video and if it goes really well, and you are thinking of choosing the career that involves these things, you can even include it on your portfolio and let them know that you were interested/good at those things long before college.",

Frankly, most of the AR-15\u2019s on the market at this point are fine guns that will work just fine for 99% of users. Would a .44 magnum make a good weapon for home defense? Which WW2 era rifle is best for use with a bayonet? Should you buy an SKS, AK-47 or AR-15 rifle? What are most used rifle for bear defense? What is the best .22lr rifle, and why? As long as you realize you are buying a name and not a design difference then by all means it is a fine gun. Pretty much all AR\u2019s today are built to one of two specs com or Mil and with that are all pretty much identical. You are buying the SA name and are paying a premium for that name. By using the same funds you can assemble one with some basics and have a rifle that is more identical to your needs be it target defense or sport. WE have many AR\u2019s and only one is purpose bought. The rest have all been \u201cassembled\u201d by buying a built lower or bare lower and building up the lower and upper to the desired configuration. I am not good enough of a shooter to be concerned with small variations in trigger design and or barrel specifcs so my wife and I tend to lean to basic trends like twist rates and barrel lengths for the various purposes. We each have different stock desires so buying an off the shelf rifle means parts need to be removed and replaced so why buy them to start with?

It fills in nicely at a price point between the Colt 6920 and something like an M&P 15 while edging closer to the Colt in specs. It uses a BCM (another reputable manufacturer) grip, handguard and stock. Probably the only spec that falls short of mil-spec is the barrel twist rate at 1:8 versus 1:7, which isn\u2019t an issue if you aren\u2019t planning on shooting expensive heavy ammo.

        "a": "Pretty much it\u2019s the same difference between disabled and differently abled. And by that I mean, at least to me, it\u2019s an insulting way of trying to be PC and empowering of people with disabilities without facing what disabilities actually mean. It\u2019s just changing the language into something that seems less negative, not necessarily for the sake of the disabled person, but for the sake of those able bodied people around them. Lines like \u201cthey\u2019re not disabled, they\u2019re physically challenged,\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re not handicapped, they\u2019re handicapable\u201d are simply attempts to sanitize disabilities into something the non-disabled can find more palatable. I\u2019m disabled, I\u2019m handicapped, I have to try harder than able bodied people to do things I want to do and enjoy, but there will always be things I cannot do, things I have to give up on. Changing the language from \u201cphysically disabled\u201d to \u201cphysically challenged\u201d won\u2019t change anything and just makes light of the limits I live with. How difficult is to\u00a0 have a girlfriend or boyfriend for a person who is suffering from any physical disability? How do I take care of a physically disabled person? If you are a person with a physical disability, what was your worst experience with public/private transports? Disability and Disabilities: Will you hesitate to offer a job to any physically challenged person or will you not? Disability and Disabilities: Would you date a physically challenged guy who walks with the help of elbow crutches? Physically challenged people are those who are suffering from a certain disease or in other words, their affected body part will be still working but slowly when compared to other as it is affected by disease. Physically disabled people are those whose affected body part/s don't work. But their brain works. The answer here can be found in the words you have used. If something is a \u2018challenge\u2019, then it is difficult but not impossible. A person would find it challenging but not insurmountable. On the other hand if something is \u2018disabled\u2019 then it is in a sense \u2018turned off\u2019 (my apologies for how that sounds, but it is purely for illustration). I would say that someone who is physically challenged will face difficulty in certain tasks, whereas someone who is physically disabled will simply not be able to do them. In my opinion these terms should be mutually interchangeable; A person could be classed as physically challenged in one task but then classed as physically disabled in another. Either way, if they are struggling or unable, help them out. As my \u201ctag line\u201d says, I was born with Cerebral Palsy and then lost all fine motor control in my right arm due to an allergic reaction to Penicillin at age 2, furthermore I also lost some of my remaining mobility in 2003 when an ER Doctor failed to diagnose a broken back. Short Answer: SOME people view \u201cchallenged\u201d as Politically Correct, even though the term was invented by Disability Rights Advocates in an attempt to clarify that we can do many things if we have enough time and feel the benefit of doing them outweighs the risk of further injury. These same people view \u201cdisabled\u201d as the \u201ccorrect\u201d term. Long Answer: \u201cDisabled\u201d literally means \u201cnot able\u201d (to function in, or benefit, society implied). Although you did not specifically ask about this term, \u201cHandicapped\u201d derives from \u201ccap in hand\u201d and implies we can only survive by begging for the generosity and aid of the \u201cable bodied\u201d population around us. Personally, I believe that \u201cDisabled\u201d is correct when the person has no way other than outside HUMAN help to accomplish a certain task, such as a person with Spina Bifida being unable to move, OR EVEN FEEL, his or her own body from the point of injury down. By contrast, I consider \u201cChallenged\u201d correct when the person can accomplish a certain task with the aid of some THING. Whether that thing is additional time, an assistance animal, or even just a mechanical reacher. Yes, my definition does result in the same person being both Challenged and Disabled depending on the task undertaken.

        "a": "Well, if I live near the Semeru mountain, I don\u2019t see any problems. There is tiny number vehicle there so basically there is no traffic. It\u2019s tree everywhere so no pollution. In Tengger everybody seems to know everybody. They respect each other. As you see, the existence of the problems depend on your perspectives. Of course someone who live in Tengger can\u2019t possibly understand about your problem. Someone who lives in Jakarta, who must struggling through traffic and pollution everyday, might think life in Tengger seems enjoyable. So here what I think one of the main problems. Indonesian lack understanding about others, myself included. Many answers here mention corruption. Of course I condemn corruption. Then what? So many times people throw judgement to other people easily then stop at that. We do not look further to why some government official corrupt. Are they pure evil? Or are there certain circumstances that lead them? There is a recent event that draw my interest. No, not the \u201cAhok and Al-Maidah\u201d thing. There is a case in Rembang, a cement factory meet resistance of local residence. Actually it is not that recent. I heard the the news of the conflict approximately a year ago. This kind of conflict actually quite common in Indonesia and you won\u2019t see it in the headline of national newspapers or magazines. Both side could be perceived wrong and good at the same time. All Indonesian want progress, want a better life. Although, progress is not necessarily the same meaning for every Indonesian. And, that\u2019s it folk. For Indonesian Quoran, I\u2019ve got homework for you :) Please, nurture understanding and spread it like paddy seeds in Tengger. I just heard too many BS. Indonesia 2020-lah, Indonesia 2030-lah, Indonesia-2045-lah, Indonesia Emas. And I heard too deep regrets from some old professor. I hope you guys don\u2019t become an old man filled with regrets. Indonesia: What do Indonesians think of Donald Trump? What do Chinese Indonesians think of native Indonesians? What do native indonesians think of Ahok? Indonesia: What are strengths and weaknesses of Indonesians? How do native Indonesians think of Chinese Indonesians? Ahok said it before: Akar segala masalah negara adalah  korupsi . Untuk menyelesaikan cuma tranparansi. Enggak ada pilihan. Roughly translated: The root of all the country's problem is  corruption . The solution is transparency. No other choice. Poverty? Poor education? Poor infrastructure? We can solve that with money. Why don't we have money? Because corruption. Discrimination? Indonesian people are relatively peaceful and tolerant. The road is not exactly smooth but I, as a minority, never feel unsafe living here. Who stirred up recent religious and racial conflicts? For what reason? I'm sure you know the answer. It all boils down to corruption. This country is corrupted to the core, the clean and honest politicians don't have place in the government, they must be kicked out, whatever it takes. The biggest one, is actually not so much of what\u2019s in the country, but  the people.  A lot of them  are very ignorant,  in my opinion. That ignorance really rooted so deep into the mindset of the people, that any small problem, go unchecked out of ignorance, could really go bigger by itself because, well, nobody cares. Few answers regarding that: My answer to What do you hate the most about being Indonesian? My answer to Why are Indonesians overly proud when someone mentions their country? My answer to What is your opinion on Indonesian scholarship awardees who prefer to stay abroad instead of serving their nation? What about their patriotism? My answer to What is it like to live in Indonesia? My answer to What is the potential of the tourism industry in Indonesia? Indonesia as a country actually have  TONS  of potentials that no country in Asia have, even compared to the \u201cfinished product\u201d countries like Japan or Korea. If you really take a look at Indonesian \u201creal\u201d cultures\u2014not the one imported from the Middle-East\u2014you will find that Indonesia is one of the most diverse country in the world. Name any other country that have  dozens  of dialects, languages, traditional clothings, traditional architecture, arts, musical instruments, theater and everything else in between\u2014you\u2019d be hard pressed to name one, I would believe. Even compared to other Asian countries like Japan and Korea\u2014the two most \u201cgodly\u201d countries in the eyes of people of Indonesia today\u2014they are pretty boring and uniform if you compare them with what we have here in terms of culture and natural resources. Sure, they got 4 seasons, but we have 4 times or more beaches and other natural attractions they could  only  drool on.  We have  dragons  in the country, for god\u2019s sake!  Other countries could only  draw  dragons\u2014how lame is that? That in itself is something on its own. Komodo can\u2019t breath fire, but at least it\u2019s  real. Not wanting to be so long-winding about this\u2014honestly, I don\u2019t know how much other Indonesians  really  know what they have inside their country in terms of culture and natural resources, but I for one, the way I see it, discovered so many treasures in the country, which nobody seem to see at all. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the country, but plenty of things wrong indeed with the people inside them. You can read my other answer to understand what I\u2019m talking about. Cheers. The main cause of all of these problems in Indonesia is the lack of nationalism/patriotism amongst its people. Simply put, a lot of Indonesians do not love \u201cIndonesia\u201d as a country as much as they love their other \u201cidentities\u201d (e.g. religion, family and ethnicity). A few months ago, I had the pleasure of meeting one of Indonesia\u2019s governors directly. I bumped onto one of his associates while I was on a flight to Jakarta. His associate introduced me to him while we were disembarking from the plane. During our conversation, the associate asked him, \u201cKenapa ya pak, murid-murid luar negeri jarang balik ke Indonesia?\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cWhy do students who are studying abroad rarely go back to Indonesia?\u201d He nonchalantly answered, \u201cYa kan gaji mereka di Indonesia nggak banyak,\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cIt\u2019s because the [average] salary here is too low for them.\u201d Imagine, a governor\u2019s first response to a question like that is geared towards personal benefit (that being said, I do agree with him though, and I certainly can understand his position). Here\u2019s another example; none of the recent public outcries were about Indonesia\u2019s problems. Instead, Indonesians were fighting each other because of their religious beliefs and/or ethnicity. We say, \u201cI\u2019m a Muslim,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a Christian,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a <insert religious belief here>.\u201d We say, \u201cI\u2019m a Jakartan,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a Dayak,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a Chinese-Indonesian,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a Batak.\u201d However, Indonesians rarely say, \u201cI\u2019m a proud Indonesian.\u201d This lack of love for the country\u2019s national identity gives birth to a plethora of problems, such as corruption and discrimination. When an Indonesian enters public service, he/she, more often than not, will see it as a career choice instead of, well, a public service towards the Indonesian people (or even the local population). This sows the seed of \u201ccorruption\u201d within the government, as people are more interested in advancing their personal agenda instead of the country\u2019s. (And, as you might have known, corruptions leads to other issues such as pollution and traffic.) So, in my honest opinion, no, corruption and discrimination is not the cause of the problem; they are merely symptoms of a greater problem; Indonesians thinking that they are Chinese-Indonesians or Pribumis, instead of thinking that they are all fellow Indonesians. Well\u2026 We were colonized by the Dutch for  350 years, The Japanese for  3,5 years , Went under a dictatorship for  32 years, And seized through a fucking corrupted presidency for  10 years . We have not spoken nor experience real freedom; received any  real  benefit from our taxes; and rulled under genuine democracy for (at least)\u2026  395.5 years. So, where shoud I begin?",

There are several Biosafety level 4 labs in India and they all have done great research till now. A better recombinant vaccine for Anthrax was developed a long time ago by Dr. Yogendra Singh from IGIB. Leaving developing countries behind there is no developed country in the world which can counter a bioweapon attack. There are so many things which can be used as a bioweapon in mutiple ways that the enemy cannot even predict. One great risk associated with most bioweapons is that they can backfire. Disease pathogens, plant pathogens, poisonous gases etc. can be carried by air also, so if you drop a giant sarin gas bomb at your neighbour and suddenly the wind starts blowing towards you then its going to be bad for you. Bioweapons are a grave danger to humanity as a whole and it experienced this danger during world war 1 and that's is why no one dared to use them again in world war 2, except some small scale secret missions. Also, developing a bioweapon is not easy. Those that are easily made are not efficient. Why did terrorism become so big only after 1990? The Muslims were there before that. The Quran was there even before that. Why now? How do we limit the threat of bio-terrorism? Synthetic Biology: How easy is it to engineer a deadly bacterium/virus? How do you differentiate a virus from a bacterium? Can viruses live in dead skin? The genetic code of the smallpox virus is known. It is already possible for labs to turn that code into live viruses. With a bit of work it will probably be possible to alter the code so that current smallpox vaccines do not provide immunity. The equipment needed to do that will soon exist in every university and pharmaceutical company. I do not know why Nigeria should be any more worried than any other nation.",

NASA states as The equipment onboard the Apollo Command Module that was used to make the recordings was called the Data Storage Equipment (DSE). Its contents were transmitted to the ground periodically during the mission. Also, the Command Module DSE had the capability to record data live during certain periods from the Lunar Module as it flew separately in lunar orbit. The equipment used aboard the Lunar Module to make the recordings was called the Data Storage Electronics Assembly (DSEA). It made recordings onboard the Lunar Module, but the DSEA flown on the Eagle during Apollo 11 malfunctioned. As a result, many of its recordings are barely, if at all, audible, with a constant high-pitched background tone. In the attached database, the recordings that are virtually inaudible are highlighted, but they are available on the web to ensure a complete release of the recordings made during the mission. AND The portion of the broadcast spectrum traditionally used for video was sending vital ship data to Earth, and there was no room left for the standard black-and- white video format of the era: 525 scan lines of data at 30 frames per second, transmitted at 4.5 MHz. So Lebar helped devise a smaller \"oddball format\" \u2013 320 scan lines at 10 fps, transmitted at a meager 500 kHz. Tracking stations back on Earth would take this so-called slow-scan footage, convert it for TV broadcast, and beam it to Mission Control, which would send it out for the world to see. Transmission stations To ensure a direct transmission signal from the moon, NASA had to maintain stations in three continents \u2013 two in Australia (the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station near Canberra and the Parkes Radio Observatory surrounded by sheep paddocks west of Sydney); one at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in the Mojave Desert of California; and one at the Madrid Manned Flight Tracking Site in Spain........ the tracking stations with a direct line on the Apollo 's signal were the ones in Australia. The 200-foot-diameter radio dish at the Parkes facility managed to withstand freak 70 mph gusts of wind and successfully captured the footage, which was converted and relayed to Houston.",

Now, be patient till the universe does wonders as i believe it will. It may take some time but it surely would.. provided , you do not doubt it. You would  eventually  feel good being done to you. Your goodness will eventually come back to you and you would never regret being so good and positive.

These days, a large game will split this job over multiple people - maybe a concept artist will draw a sketch of the general idea, then a 3D modeller will make the environment, and graphics artists will create suitable textures and add other visual effects, and a programmer adds the interactive parts. Historically, in a game like Quake 1, you\u2019d have a number of assets and textures that came with the game. A level designer could then put together rooms and corridors to make a 3D map, texture the walls/floor/ceilings/skybox, put in doors and assets (weapons, health packs, lights, teleporters), wire up a few triggers (\u201cwhen button pushed open hidden door\u201d), and have a playable map (\u201clevel\u201d).",

        "a": "You don\u2019t. For one thing, lots of people work hard and don\u2019t come close to the 1%. But, take my dad. The child of illiterate Russian Jewish immigrants, he worked hard all his life. He worked his way through high school, then went in the Army (they sent him to college). Then he went to Harvard Law (which, from what I can gather, was the easiest three years of his life in terms of amount of work). Then he worked 80 and 90 hour weeks for decades. And he became part of the 1%. He didn\u2019t go around telling people - I only know because I\u2019m his kid. Instead, he kept working and also spent a lot of time giving back. Oh, and saying how lucky he got and how much other people helped him. That\u2019s the way to behave. If you worked hard, the people who need to know, know. The only one who really needs to know is you. I'm not very smart, but I work extremely hard. Will I be able to succeed? How hard did Steve Jobs work? No matter how hard I work, I'm never able to keep up with everyone else. I feel like I think I'm smart, but I'm really not. What am I doing wr... Why do rich people work even after they become rich? Why don't they play? What is important in life: luck or hard work? Oh, for the love of all that is good, how friggin\u2019 arrogant can you be? My dad busted his ass his entire life, and he feels very fortunate that he has a pension to retire on. Please, take a moment to consider how little it would take to wipe out everything you have \u201cworked hard for\u201d. Take a moment to consider all the lucky breaks that you should be grateful for. There are billions of people that work very hard for poverty level wages. What makes your effort somehow better than theirs? That you are smarter than them? Well, do you have any gratitude for your good fortune in getting good genes, and a good upbringing? There is one required ingredient, without which, no amount of hard work will make you wealthy, and that is good luck. Great answers. I echo the same. Here\u2019s the thing no one tells you about people. The majority of us work hard, and don\u2019t deserve to live in squalor. Very few of us will actually achieve the 1% standard of living. Lots of things need to align for that to happen  other than hard work. My father was in the 1%. He made over a quarter a million a year at one point. Sure he worked hard, but by no means was he not being well compensated for it. Then he had a heart attack. Quit his job, and started working retail in a hardware store, because he thought it would be simpler and easier on his lifestyle. He worked  harder  in that stupid retail store than he ever did in his six-figure job, and had to get two surgeries for on the job injuries. He lifted more weight, dealt with more angry people, drove in worse weather, got chewed out by more employees. THAT was hard work. The highest paying job I ever had was the also the easiest. I sat in an office in downtown Chicago and answered the phone all day. I got a  severance pay  when I quit. There was free coffee, food, and the building was impeccably air conditioned. Oh, health insurance was included. Easiest fucking job I ever had. An idiot could have done it. The hardest job I ever had paid 5.25 an hour back in 2002 in Phoenix, AZ. I washed dishes at a shitty restaurant where the cooks were also kids my age who frequently whipped my back with a wet towel. I was 5\u20320\u2033 at the time, and they had no problem lifting me into the trash bin. I\u2019d come home at night with welts on my back smelling like garbage. All for a measly 25 dollars a shift (before taxes). It was the hardest I ever worked in my life. You don\u2019t, because it misses the point. No one cares how you made your money (and making good business decisions is \u201cwork\u201d but it\u2019s also not the same as paving roads in 90 degree heat or working 3 retail jobs with no benefits and children to feed.) What matters is 1) what you do with your money and privilege to help other people who lack either or both and 2) how you treat people who lack either or both. No one complains that Warren Buffet is rich. He\u2019s honest that he hit the genetic lottery and ended up in a life that allowed him to be rich and become richer. He gives a lot of money away because he understands that money is not a measure of worthiness. I worked hard too. We didn\u2019t have much growing up, and when I was a teen, things were hard. Money was tight well into my 40s. I have worked 2 or 3 jobs regularly since I was 14. I\u2019m in the top 27% and feel pretty comfortable now\u2026but I also understand that one severe illness or accident could destroy that. So I work hard to ensure financial and legal stability for others as well as myself. Because a lot of folks are more precarious than I. Be kind for kindness sake, be good to your fellow humans, and stop giving a shit about being understood. If you do the first two, the third will cease to matter.",

Is there life after death? Has anyone had the experience of being dead for a minute or so and coming back to life? How can you describe life as a potato? Can a potato diet sustain life? What would life be like without potatoes? I can think of four scenarios Millions will die. Potatoes have almost exactly the same densities as humans. If they came to life, they'll be quite similar to us in terms of build. Potatoes are technically living, so I'll assume you mean get up and start running around. Potatoes can't do photosynthesis so they'll need food. I'm not sure how much potatoes are in the world but I'm pretty sure they can combine to produce the mass of about a few billion more human equivalent. That means our food resources will be thinned out since they need food as well. We wouldn't have enough to support the increased population. Nothing happens. The only difference is that we just will have more careers in potato hunting and poaching. We just catch them cook them. If anything, it'll be better for the economy! We all die. Potatoes wage wars on us as the human race struggles to survive. It will be in vain because, they're potatoes. They cant lose. What do we fire bullets at potatoes? Scientists finally are able to prove that we are indeed living, walking giant potatoes! It will be an international public holiday as we rejoice with our smaller versions and repent for the cannibalism we've been committing. They do. A potato is the tuberous root of a perennial nightshade plant known as  Solanum tuberosum. All that happens when a potato \u201ccomes to life\u201d is that they begin germination and little sprouts (or \u201ceyes\u201d) grow on them. Like so: In which that case, you can either plant it and grow a lot more potatoes or you can chop the eye off and eat the rest of it. I personally like to shred them up and fry them up into home-fries. Yum! Well, then they would all be gone because McDonald's would turn them into french fries. That or I eat them all, lol.",

        "a": "The Government of India has been opposing  to join  CPEC because it violates its sovereignty as it passes through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. That is about it for the  government. The founders of India were so paranoid of companies taking over a country's economic activities (due to free trade) (and that the companies could be used by the countries in which they were founded to gain leverage in the global political scenario) that they completely cut off the economy from the rest of the world and aimed towards building indigenous industries first so that domestic businesses could fairly compete with the rest of the world. Pakistan, however, went for an open economy which did not let its industry grow (other than maybe textiles and footballs). Indians have been skeptical and critical of CPEC becsuse they think that the influx of cheap chinese goods will further stagnate the domestic industry. It is said that two soldiers have been deployed for one chinese worker at Pakistan's expense. Questions have also been raised on the cost of electricity that will be paid by Pakistan. The loan of $50 BN (interest needs to paid on capital invested or else it does not make fiscal sense to invest which needs to be understood by Pakistanis) is huge for Pakistan. It is about 1/5 th of its GDP (not even the taxes collected). Consider this. The taxes collected by the Government of Pakistan have amounted to about $3.5 BN. Pakistan has to pay to China around $3.5 BN every fiscal year. This is going to make the economic situation for Pakistan very stressful. Pakistan will be paying China $90b against CPEC-related projects - The Express Tribune In Sri Lanka, China built the airport at Hambantota. Sri Lanka could not pay back to China the loan and hence it was taken over by China. Now what if it was the only airport in Sri Lanka? The Chinese government could have literally choked Sri Lanka of economic activity. Now there are a lot of assumptions that have been made here but the fact that there is Chinese money involved (and a lot of it for a country like Pakistan) is enough for us to assume that the same is very likely to happen to Pakistan. Pakistan has seemed to have bitten off more than it can chew. Only time will tell whether they can pull it off. In short, it is the amount of loan, its conditions and a bad result of Chinese investment in Sri Lanka are the major reasons why Indians \u201cbadmouth\u201d or rather criticize CPEC. If Pakistan succeeds in profiting from it, kudos to them! What is CPEC for Pakistan? Why is India so jealous of Pakistan CPEC's great success? Will CPEC make Pakistan stronger than India? Is CPEC beneficial for Pakistan? How? China and Pakistan have proposed to India to join the CPEC. Should India join this project? No. This decision is taken by Pakistani Politicians only for corruption. These Pakistani politicians are not different from the Sri Lankan politicians who sold their nation to China. The recent dawn article proved that thing. Pakistan Governments original intention was to get billions of kickbacks through this project, this is why they tried to keep this project secret. But there is the very big game is going behind the scene. If you want to know about that please check my this answer. Arvind Goenka's answer to What is the opinion of Pakistanis on the CPEC Master Plan published in Dawn? For India, the main objection for CPEC is because it crosses through Kashmir which is India's territory. Other than that, India has no interest as to whether Pakistan benefits from CPEC or not. For India, OBOR brings little gains. India is not reliant on China for our trade. We do not take big loans from China but China do invest in India which come on the form of FDI. But China is only one among many investors who invest in India. India is too busy building our economy to be concerned about Pakistan. Certainly not! \u2026.. Pakistan would understand that later when they would have to pay the debt of billions\u2026.. \u2026.. Wait for the time to come, like always they would regret this decision but won't be able to accept in the open world. Enjoy bro!",

You can\u2019t use it to get anywhere you want in the Kingdom, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if your purpose is tourism. The work visa is relatively easy to get because of the Kefala system, which allows Saudis to hire foreigners for almost any sort of work. This visa is expensive, and it requires that you have a good Saudi friend who is willing to go with the process. Keep in mind that your Saudi friend will have certain legal authority over you through this visa. This is probably your easiest way. You can of course just apply for a job at a regular company, and this will give you the same access without being under the authority of a specific person. But in this case, you will have to be committed to your contract with your company. The other way to go to Saudi Arabia is a student visa, which is hard to get, and you shouldn\u2019t be looking at it if you don\u2019t really want to study.

        "a": "Paradoxes in Macbeth Paradox #1 \"Fair is foul, and foul is fair\"* (I.i.11). The witches talk among themselves, foreshadowing what is to happen with Macbeth in the future. Explanation: What is good is bad, and what is bad is good. Paradox #2* \"So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come, discomfort swells\" (I.ii.27-28) The captain tells King Duncan about the latest battle and the killing of Macdonwald by Macbeth. Explanation: They were originally satisfied with the murder of Macdonwald, but now it has caused further problems. Paradox #3* \"Lesser than Macbeth, and greater. Not so happy, yet much happier. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none\" (I.iii.66-68). As the witches tell Macbeth his prophecies, the witches then tell Banquo what is to be of his future. Explanation: Banquo's future will be better and worse than Macbeth's. He will be happy, but there will be times where there is no happiness. Banquo will never become king, but he will have many descendants that will be king.*Paradox #4 \"This supernatural soliciting cannot be ill, cannot be good\" (I.iii.133-134). After being named Thane of Cawdor like the witches predicted, he wonders if the rest of their prediction will come true, and questions if believing these witches is a good thing. Explanation: The witches predictions must be a good thing because it came true, but it also may not be a good thing because now he's contemplating murdering Duncan to become king. Paradox #5* \"False face must hide what the false heart doth know\" (I.vii.82). Macbeth and Lady Macbeth begin to contemplate murdering Duncan and how they will go about it. Explanation: Don't show what you know in your heart by the expression on your face. Paradox #6* \"To know my deed 'twere best not know myself\" (II.ii.760). After Macbeth kills Duncan, he begins to regret what he has done. Explanation: Knowing what I have done, I don't want to live with myself. Paradox #7* \"Were the graced person of our Banquo present, who I may rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance\" (III.iv.42-44). As Macbeth attends his banquet, he talks of hoping to see Banquo attend, but ends up seeing his ghost. Explanation: Macbeth talks about Banquo as if he really cares about him and he hopes all is well, when he just had Banquo killed. Paradox #8 \"Fathered he is, and yet he's fatherless\" (IV.ii.27). Lady Macduff expresses her anger at the fact that Macduff left her and his son vulnerable. Explanation: Her son does have a father, but considering how Macduff just left them like a coward, he might as well not have a father. Paradox #9 \"This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, was once thought honest. You have loved him well; he hath not touched you yet\" (IV.iii.12-14). Malcolm and Macduff discuss what they should do about Macbeth becoming king. That\u2019s seven in total Why does Shakespeare use a paradox in Macbeth? What are some paradoxes in \"Macbeth\"?

If he/she insists that I perform a non-paid excercise to test my abilities, I would politely decline and show myself out. I am not at school anymore, why would a client be prepared to decide upon the quality of my work? I have respect for myself and for my professional career. Would you go into a restaurant and demand the chef to prepare something for you just to see if you like the food? I do not have any problem working pro bono, but I do not work for free. What is it like to work as a graphic designer? Why are graphic designers always asked to work for free? What is the work of a graphic designer? How can I get admission in graphic design at IITB? What exams must be cleared? How many years of experience would I need in order to do freelance work in graphic design? Badly. Very badly. In the moment, I\u2019ve probably been very gracious and completed whatever task has been set before me \u2014 perhaps somewhat facetiously. But in theory, I hate it. The idea that a CV including years of design work, clients like National Geographic and Harper Collins, and a first class degree in graphic design can be met with a \u201cwe need you to do this task so we can make sure you\u2019re really a designer\u201d is deeply frustrating. The way job applications work now is pretty messed up (for instance, having a degree in something is worth more than lengthy experience) but to force interviewees to take on exercises to prove they\u2019re not massive liars is pretty irksome. But then, you do have to consider that these companies have probably been burned before by bad hires - though that still isn\u2019t our fault as designers. A professional should never be asked to work for free. While it\u2019s true that advertising agencies sometimes do this in order to get a large advertising account, they choose to assume the risk because the potential reward is a contract that may be worth millions of dollars. Designers are rarely in that situation. If a potential client asks you to any kind of work (even rough concepts) with no guarantee of payment, they do not have your interests at heart and do not consider what you do to be of much value. This is not the kind of client you want to work for. If you do this even once, it sets a precedent, and I guarantee you will be asked to do it again once they know you\u2019re willing. I personally know of situations in which a designer gave away his ideas in hopes of landing the business only to find that the \u201cclient\u201d took his ideas and had another designer do the work. This practice is unethical and devalues then entire design industry. What IS acceptable is doing preliminary design work for a fee, but giving the client the option of terminating the project if he decides not to follow it through to completion. However, it should be made clear in writing that ownership of the concepts remain yours and the client relinquishes the right to use your ideas after that point. Not well. It\u2019s all in context, of course. Junior-level, just out of school, not much resume? It\u2019s not necessarily unreasonable. I\u2019ve got 30+ years in the arena.

In addition, all the services you use online (Netflix, amazon, gmail, Quora etc) will get more expensive, less innovative, and may even be blocked or placed behind a new subscription fee. Without Title II Net Nutrality in place your internet service plan may start to look like this: That looks like fun\u2026 Oh you think all that \u201cmarket competition\u201d will prevent internet providers from doing something like that? Guess again At just 25 Mbps most Americans (75%) have just one (or fewer) option to buy internet service. And in most cases that company is\u2026 Comcast Over 40% of broadband connections over 25 Mbps in the US are sold by NBC|Comcast. So it's not a \u201ccompetitive market\u201d it's a series of regional monopolies with Comcast controling almost half the country's access to the internet at home. Modern ISP\u2019s are just like the baby bells of the previous era, and they need to be regulated like them\u2026 Otherwise they'll be deciding whose websites and services you can and cannot use online. If NBC|Comcast decides you shouldn't be visiting news and video sites run by Fox, CBS, ABC, etc that will be the only choice for hundreds of millions of Americans. Think it won't happen or has never happened in the US? Try again. In 2005 Madison River (an ISP in North Carolina) decided to block Vonage and other VOIP services to protect the phone service they were selling. In 2005 Comcast began secretly interfering with certain types of download traffic; this also interfered with popular online game services that customers paid to access (like World of Warcraft, etc). From 2007\u20132009 AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and others competing VOIP call services on iPhones. In 2011 MeteoPCS announced plans to block all video services except for YouTube. In 2011 several small ISP\u2019s stared working with a company called Paxfire to intercept and redirect users who tried to use Bing and Yahoo search. By redirecting those users\u2019 searches the ISP\u2019s would earn a referral fee and users would be sent to results from other 3rd party search services. 2011\u20132013 AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-mobile all blocked access to Google Wallet to promote their own planned payment system. 2012 AT&T disabled FaceTime calling for users on lower cost (legacy) unlimited data plans unless they switched to higher cost data caped plans. We know exactly what will happen when they roll back Title II Net Neutrality because it was happening before the rules were created. If a company like Yahoo Answers decides to \u201cpartner\u201d with Comcast and pay them a bunch of money Comcast can agree to block internet access to competing services like Quora. Title II Net Neutrality is the only thing stopping ISP\u2019s from doing that right now, and Verizon has already testified in court that they intend to do exactly that\u2026 Would internet service providers really block forum sites if we lose net neutrality? What is net neutrality and how is Airtel Zero related to it? Will we lose net neutrality again and what would happen if we did? Could people have their own forum site before we had net neutrality in the US? How easy is it to buy a gun in the US? Nothing, not one stinking thing. You see, despite the hysterics there\u2019s no gain for service providers to do anything to traffic (including creating a fast lane) unless it's a substantial percentage of their traffic. There\u2019s not even technology to automatically determine what is and isn\u2019t a forum site much less be able to take action on that information. Even more important, there\u2019s no market for slowing down some forum sites or speeding up others. Which forum site on the Internet do you think could and would want to pay to be the \u201cfastest\u201d or the preferred forum site of Comcast? Keep in mind that the infrastructure to actually enforce this kind of preference (assuming we could identify all the other forum sites) would cost many millions of dollars to purchase and install and more money to keep running correctly. They may get a bit slower. Net neutrality is not about blocking sites, it is about having fast and slow lanes: the slow lane is free, the fast lane has to be paid for. Text-based sites will not be much affected by being in the slow lane. High data rate sites, such as video, will be slowed and might become unusable.",

If the lane is being added  without  a merge (for example the \u2018auxiliary\u2019 lanes in this diagram), theoretically it shouldn\u2019t be necessary as people shouldn\u2019t be outside the fog lines. But the check is still not a bad idea if the traffic is heavy. Especially on heavily congested roads, it\u2019s not at all uncommon to see an aggressive driver either jump the gun on getting into the new lane or at the least get into it right away and speed up to pass without waiting for the traffic to settle, thus creating a hazard for other motorists seeking to merge into it. Better safe than sorry, even though the resultant accident would  probably  be ruled the fault of the lane jumper. (That much said, I am usually constantly watching my rear-view mirror for this type of assholes and so I\u2019m generally aware of how likely the above possibility is. If there\u2019s not much traffic about or the traffic is well-behaved, I usually can skip the extra head movement. If you\u2019re doing a road test for a driver\u2019s licence, don\u2019t skip it though\u2014it certainly never  hurts .) (Images from the Federal Highway Administration.) All of my stress goes to my left upper shoulder and it's always sore. It's actually visibly bigger than my right shoulder. How can I fix this?... How do I stop a glitch on my left shoulder? Since I have started working out, my shoulders are not level anymore. My right shoulder is lower compared to my left. How do I correct this? Can I go straight through a left turn lane? Do you have to turn left into the left lane? There are so many things that you need to be aware of when changing lanes, even if it's a new designated lane. My driving habits are to communicate with signaling, checking by looking in the driver, passenger, rear view, and driver again before a final head turn before slowly transitioning to a new lane. You can never know when someone else may decide to move to a lane without doing any of the above, so it's up to you to be aware of your own safety. Based on other questions, I understand that \u201cshoulder check\u201d is a problem. People who are not taking an actual road test may not always do a full, over-the-shoulder check of a lane that has newly opened up, when a road goes from two lanes to three. People who have DMV Agents in the car with them during a road test would do well to make some body motion that suggests an over-the-shoulder look has been made, or perhaps, discuss physical limitations with the Test Agent before the road test. People with all sorts of limitations get licenses. There are work-arounds for most things. Other drivers do the damnedest things. I heard of someone killed because he pulled out to pass three cars at one go, and the car at the top of the line turned left. I can see someone pulling into the shoulder to pass you on the left, knowing there was a new lane coming up, and then you hitting them thinking there couldn\u2019t possibly be anyone in that lane because it just opened up. You might be in the clear, but they would be dead. The main thing you need to remember while driving, especially on multi-lane highways, is that no matter how good of a driver you are, you have to assume that every other driver on the road is an idiot. Because sooner or later, that will be proven true. So ANY TIME that you go past a junction, you need to assume that someone will pull into your lane, without looking, and unless you are fully aware of your surroundings, you will be involved in an accident. The short answer is - I do. You never know what clown might be in a bigger hurry than you and try to zip around. And he could be hiding in your blind spot when you check the mirror. Even when it\u2019s not necessary, i.e., the above isn\u2019t even possible, I still do because it\u2019s a good habit. Always better to be safe, than sorry.",

Believe me they(online sellers) boast about many guarantee policies but refrain to any complaints made by consumers. While buying from online sellers always make a photo copy of the receipt because the print the receipt on thermal paper which vanishes after a certain amount of time and you may find yourself in trouble during malfunctioning of your device. Now. If you are buying from retail store the pros are you can always negotiate and get a great discount. Plus they give away free accessories and software packages. They (some) also provide door step assistance during need. So accordingly choose where you would like to buy your laptop from Should I buy a laptop online or in a shop?

Also  http://www.cpu-world.com/Compare...  says multimedia performance is 8x with just %66 more core frequency. AVX instructions are upgraded version of SSE and SSE is next step up from MMX. MMX is a multimedia data streaming accelerator instruction group and started with Intel\u2019s MMX series. MMX instructions can do two 32-bit floating-point operations with just a single instruction. SSE can do 4, AVX can run 8 32-bit FP operations in single instruction. Less instructions per operation leaves more bandwidth for data which comes from same memory chip where instructions are fetched. Doing 8 operations with 1 instruction vs 8 instructions has some advantages: more pipeline room for following instructions leads to greater instruction level parallelism(which uses more area/transistors of CPU at a time) more operations per second is achieved by just the usage of SIMD hardware implicitly aligned accessing to memory gives a good boost to streaming data performance(such as watching video, calculating physics) since memory controllers are used more efficiently. much more temporary in-chip storage makes it fast too there are too many instructions to know in this cathegory and to overcome that, compilers and some APIs automatically convert developer codes to AVX versions which saves a lot of developing time while giving decent optimization to program before releasing it. For example, if you use OpenCL, it automatically generates AVX codes for the CPU whether it is AMD or INTEL. I don\u2019t know current state but in past Windows was able to use only half of those AVX-capable registers in CPU while Linux was using all of them which is good thing for some performance critical codes. Calculation of a=b+c resulted 30 times faster execution with AVX compared to non-AVX code for my FX8150 powered pc. This helps more when data type is smaller like a single byte. Single AVX instruction can process 32 byte values which must be more than enough to encode-decode 1080p video at 30 fps even with just single core of a 3\u20134 GHz CPU. Intel\u2019s xeon-phi series pci-e form factor compute devices can use 512-bit versions of AVX instructions that can work on 16 variables at once. Should I use C++ vector or C array? Which computers are using Linux? How I use vectors for a 2D array in C++? How do I use templates and vectors in C++? How can I remove a file extension on my computer? A CPU operates on registers, only 32 or 64 bits big. They contain variables to compute with, and also some dedicated pointers to program counter, stack pointer, something in memory, \u2026 . The cpu operates on these registers using assembly commands, very basic instructions like add, multiply, branch (if/else), load/store something to memory, \u2026 Each of these instructions is processed in several steps, defined by the architecture. In MIPS, there are 5 steps: instruction fetch, instruction decode (access registers), execute, memory access, write back. When doing computation work, with lots of add or multiply instructions after each other, these steps are mostly identical for each instruction. Therefore, vector registers and multimedia extensions (like AVX) were created. These modified registers contain multiple values, and a single (slightly modified) instruction can be used to add/multiply all values. This means you only duplicate the effective execute step, and only need to fetch, decode, store the instruction data once.",

        "a": "What is vomiting blood (haematemesis)? The medical word for vomiting blood is haematemesis. This symptom is usually due to a problem within the upper gut. That is, the gullet (oesophagus), stomach or the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). There is a range of different causes - discussed below. Vomiting of blood is a medical emergency . In many cases the bleeding will stop quite quickly but in some cases it can become severe and life-threatening. Therefore, call an ambulance or go directly to the nearest emergency department if you vomit blood. Understanding the upper gut Your gut (gastrointestinal tract) is the tube that starts at your mouth, and ends at your bottom (anus). The upper gut includes the gullet (oesophagus), stomach and first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Food passes down the oesophagus into the stomach. The stomach makes acid which is not essential but helps to digest food. After being mixed in the stomach, food passes into the duodenum, to be digested. Some types of bleeding from the upper gut The type of bleeding is sometimes described as follows: Dark blood . This is often referred to as a 'coffee ground' colour. This suggests that the bleed has been relatively slow. The blood has been in contact with stomach acid long enough for the acid to turn the blood a dark brown/red colour. The bleeding in this situation may not yet have been heavy. However, it may become heavy at a later time. A large amount of bright red blood  suggests a rapid and large bleed. Melaena  is the medical word for old, dark blood in poo (stools/faeces). If you have  melaena , your stools become very dark or black. There is often a tar-like consistency. Vomiting blood and having melaena are symptoms that often go together. Having both symptoms together means that you have had a lot of bleeding into the gut. Other symptoms may occur at the same time as vomiting blood. For example, tummy (abdominal) pain, high temperature (fever), feeling unwell, or other gut symptoms. If you lose a lot of blood, it can make you feel dizzy or even pass out. The presence and type of other symptoms may help to point to a cause of the bleeding. Sometimes there are no other symptoms at first. What are the causes of vomiting blood? There are many possible causes. Below is a brief overview of the more common and important causes: Bleeding from the gullet (oesophagus) Causes include: Oesophageal varices . Varices are enlarged, swollen blood vessels in the lining of the gullet or stomach.  They are one of the possible complications of liver cirrhosis . In cirrhosis, scarred liver tissue blocks blood flow through the liver. This causes an increase in pressure in the vein that takes blood from the gut to the liver (the portal vein). The increased pressure pushes back into the gut and causes the veins to swell in the gullet. The swellings are quite fragile and may bleed heavily into the gullet. Inflammation of the oesophagus   (oesophagitis) is often due to acid reflux from the stomach (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)) . The inflamed oesophagus sometimes bleeds. Oesophageal cancer  sometimes causes bleeding into the oesophagus . Mallory-Weiss syndrome  is bleeding caused by a tear in the lining of the oesophagus or stomach . The tear can be caused by anything that leads to a sudden rise in pressure in the stomach or the oesophagus. For example, repeated retching or vomiting, excessive straining, violent coughing or hiccupping. Bleeding from the stomach Causes include: Stomach (gastric) ulcer . An ulcer is a small hole in the lining of the stomach. An ulcer may bleed, sometimes heavily. There are several causes of stomach ulcers, including: Infection  with a germ (bacterium) called  Helicobacter pylori . This can usually be treated quite easily. Anti-inflammatory medicines  that are used to treat conditions such as arthritis, sometimes cause stomach ulcers. Aspirin, used commonly to prevent blood clots. Stress. Stomach cancer  sometimes causes bleeding into the stomach . Inflammation of the stomach lining  (gastritis) has similar causes to stomach ulcers . Varices  in the lining of the stomach may occur similar to oesophageal varices described above. Mallory-Weiss syndrome  may affect the lining of the stomach - described above. Bleeding from the first part of the small intestine (duodenum) Causes include: Duodenal ulcer . An ulcer may bleed, sometimes heavily. Like stomach ulcers, a duodenal ulcer is usually caused by an infection with the germ (bacterium) called  H. pylori . This can usually be treated quite easily. Anti-inflammatory medicines and aspirin, which are common causes of stomach ulcers, are uncommon causes of duodenal ulcers. Inflammation of the duodenum lining  (duodenitis) has similar causes to duodenal ulcers. Rare causes from any part of the upper gut Include: Radiation poisoning . Uncommon infections of the gut . Injury . No cause identified . Even after tests, in some cases the cause cannot be found. Bleeding which has not come from the gut Sometimes when blood is vomited, it has not come from the gut. For example, if you have had a  nosebleed  and then swallowed the blood, you may vomit blood. Also sometimes it can be difficult to tell whether the blood has been vomited up from the gut, or coughed up What tests may be needed? A doctor's assessment Your doctor is likely to ask various questions about the nature of the bleeding and ask if you have any other symptoms. He or she will also examine you. The doctor will try to find out if this blood is truly coming from the upper gut. Sometimes it is difficult to be sure. Sometimes it can be difficult to say if the blood is: Haemoptysis - that is, if the blood is coughed up, not vomited up . Coming from somewhere in your mouth or nose that tracks to the back of your throat, which you then swallow and vomit back up. For example, from a nosebleed. The doctor will also try to make a judgement about how much blood you have lost and how serious this is. They will be able to tell this from what you tell them and also by checking your pulse and blood pressure. If it is clear that the blood is coming from the upper gut, tests are usually done to identify the cause. Blood tests Blood tests  will usually be done to assess your general situation.  For example, how much blood you have lost,  and if you need intravenous fluid or a blood transfusion to counter any large amount of blood loss. Also,  blood tests may help to assess your liver function  if you have 'scarring' of the liver (cirrhosis), or to help diagnose or assess other causes of the bleeding. Gastroscopy A gastroscopy (endoscopy) is an internal examination. A thin, flexible telescope is passed down the gullet (oesophagus) into the stomach and to the upper duodenum . The cause of the bleeding can often be identified by endoscopy. What is the treatment for vomiting blood? Initial treatment The initial treatment may require a drip into a vein to give you fluid or even  a blood transfusion  if the bleeding is severe. This may not be necessary if the bleeding has been minor and has stopped. However, if the bleeding is severe, full resuscitation and emergency fluid/blood replacement may be required. Other treatments This will depend on the cause. However, an initial treatment to stop any ongoing bleeding can often be done by using instruments that can be passed down the endoscope (as described above). Occasionally, emergency surgery is needed to control severe ongoing bleeding. Once bleeding is stopped, further treatment depends on the cause. For details, see individual leaflets on the various diseases that can cause vomiting blood. here\u2019s link for reference Causes, Symptoms and Treatments Vomiting Blood - Symptoms, Causes, Treatments NY Times Health Information Why did I vomit blood after I drank? What causes me to throw up blood? Why do people vomit after drinking too much? How can it be avoided? Why am I spitting up blood when pregnant? What causes me to throw up acid? Even your doctors would have needed to run tests and scans to arrive at why you are throwing up blood. How can anyone on Quora, know for sure, despite you stating you have MND? There\u2019s quite a few types of MND out there; even knowing which one no doctor will be able to just look at you and tell exactly why. What I don\u2019t understand is why you didn\u2019t go to your doctor earlier. You could have directed him/her to not tell your parents anything or gone to a different one. I am assuming you are not too financially badly off seeing as how this actually got diagnosed, so it looks like you have one. Secondly if this gets worse, your parents and friends will find out anyway. Don\u2019t you think they will be more worried when your problems amplify later because you neglected them while they were solvable? Well, child, they will be in far more difficulty because you thought you were sparing their feelings first. They\u2019ll actually feel worse later and more guilty seeing how \u2018considerate\u2019 you were. They\u2019ll wonder whether they were so \u2018bad\u2019 to you that you wanted to spare them. So do everyone a favor and get off Quora and talk to your doctor  soon. You are 21, for Christ sake! Head towards a medical doctor, get investigated.The inevitable ( made me chuckle!) is road to recovery. I presume, MND stands for Motor Neurone Disease (not specified). Confide with a family or friend, you might need financial assistance for investigation if you are not independent. Early diagnosis aids in better treatment & speedy recovery.On contrary, your symptoms could be minor ailment. Best wishes. My dear friend, what do you mean by inevitable? And why can't you tell your friends and family? Note that you are younger than my daughter who's a student. So, I can talk to you like a and as a parent. Please understand that it would hurt them terribly forever that their child didn't share his pain and illness with them. Please do talk to your parents immediately. I cannot guide you medically, however, be sure to find moral and psychological support from me. You could reach me through Quora or through mail at  j.umashankara@gmail.com Please immediately consult your family physician and or a good general surgeon. Make this promise to yourself; for you, your parents and all those you meet and grew up with. Think of all that you should achieve. Be bold and sure that you will overcome the illness and become a great addition to good people of this earth Share this to your parents because if your health deteriorates then they'll get more worried.

        "a": "I don't think I understand the question. Declensions are inherently associated with nouns; each noun simply  is  a certain declension. When using each noun in a sentence, you determine the proper case and use the corresponding ending. For example, if I use the word  puella  (girl) in a sentence, as the object of a preposition that takes an accusative object, I use the first declension singular accusative ending, in this case - am . Curro ad puellam . I run towards the girl. Why does Vietnam use the Latin alphabet in their writing system? Is that a wise choice? What is the Latin word for hand and what other language/s uses a similar word? How useful is Latin? What is the use of Latin 200 medicine? In Latin, can the word \"ultra\" be used of time? Yes, there is a hard rule. First, the whole phenomenon of declension applies mainly to nouns, adjectives and pronouns. If you don\u2019t know what these terms mean, you should look them up before going on. It also applies to some words derived from verbs, which are participles, supine, gerund and gerundive - these need not concern you right now. Secondly, the rule for deciding which declension to use with each noun or adjective is\u2026 look it up in the dictionary. With extremely few exceptions (indeclinable words, mostly of non-Latin origin) each and every of these nouns and adjectives belong to one such class. The dictionary entry, by itself, should tell you to which of these classes a given word belongs. Please comment if you need a tip about how to do this. Keep in mind - this is a point seldom stressed - that  declension   is a name used for  two  things: the  phenomenon  of declension itself - that is, the changes that occur to the ending of the declinable words, depending on how they are used in a sentence - and the  patterns  which said declension follows. Every noun, save the few indeclinables, belongs to one such patterns or classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th), which are also called declensions. The declension to which each noun  belongs  is defined and fixed, it never changes, and you learn it from the dictionary. The exact way to  decline  a given word depends on it use in the sentence at hand. You don't choose declensions. You choose the dooper noun for the usage. For example: I love water. For water, I would use  aqua . It happens to be first declension. However, you do need to be mindful of declension endings. If I were to use  pater  in a sentence, I couldn't use 2nd declension endings, as it is a 3rd declension word. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th declensions refer to the various delensional patterns, and each Latin noun falls into one. Puella, girl, falls in first, puella, (girl) puellae (girls) puer, (boy) pueri (boys) is second, while lupus (wolf) lupi (wolves) is also second as is bellum (war) bella (wars) which is also neuter. Aakash has it exactly right. You don\u2019t choose the declension; you choose the noun you want for your sentence. The noun is in one of five declensions. Look it up in the dictionary to see which declension it is. Also check the gender. Then write your sentence. The gender will be necessary if you want to use an adjective with the noun. Actually, the idea of first to fifth declensions was decided hundreds of years after Latin ceased to be a living language. Some grammarians noticed that certain nouns always had the same endings, and, to make it easier for learners, they decided that those nouns were (for example) in first declension. The grammarians were actually trying to make it easier for you to deal with Latin. If you decided to go back in time to ancient Rome, you would learn all nouns one by one and figure out their declension one by one. That is what Roman babies had to do.",

Keep in mind that Costa Rica is home to more plant/animal species than the USA & Canada  combined , so with bio-diversity there comes some not-so-friendly critters too. That\u2019s the cost of living in a tropical rain forest (southern pacific region). There are many different types of poisonous snakes that are found in Costa Rica. One of the most common one in the southern pacific zone is the terciopelo/ferdelance. I lived for awhile in Australia which has a lot more poisonous snakes (in terms of species) than Costa Rica. During my time in Australia, I was told that there 14 of the 20 most poisonous snakes in the country. A quick Google search shows that Australia does indeed have a lot of poisonous/deadly snakes. The terciopelo releases a toxic nerve poison and can be fatal. In many cases, it will cause permanent damage at the site and region of the bite. If you can get to a medical facility within 30 minutes you have a chance at minimizing any permanent damage (thank goodness we are only 5 minutes away from a modern medical center). Below are some photos of terciopelos that my workers have found, and killed. It is important to always have boots on when hiking through the jungle because of the snakes. What is Costa Rica? What are some of the most famous people in Costa Rica? What are the best hikes to do in Costa Rica? What to Costa Ricans do for fun in Costa Rica? Is Costa Rica safe? I would say, snakes..a few small, a few large\u2026wear sturdy shoes and/or boots when hiking. Small frogs\u2026unlikely to encounter these, they hide very well mosquitos\u2026carry some nasty sicknesses: useDEET spray when in the woods, humid areas.

        "a": "Excellent question! Now I\u2019m gonna give this disclaimer right off the bat: Most snipers require some tech work to reach their full potential That being said, allow me to tell you about my favorite airsoft sniper rifle: The Echo1 ASR This is a fantastic rifle for a price that won\u2019t dent your wallet ($115 on  Evike.com ) It shoots about 450 FPS out of the box, and I only recommend this rifle because I own it myself. I\u2019ve been using this rifle for more than four years, and let me tell you something about this rifle. It\u2019s not the range that won me over, in fact stock the range is about average for an AEG It\u2019s not the power, although it definitely punches just a little harder than the average AEG It\u2019s the  accuracy At my local field the average distance fights happen is 75 feet to 150 feet. At 80 feet, my ASR could reliably hit one of those little golfers scope things (That) It\u2019s like 3 inches tall and an inch wide. tl;dr the rifle is freaky accurate but doesn\u2019t really have the ability out of box to outrange AEGs. But if you\u2019re good at sneaking around, if you can get in range you shouldn\u2019t have a problem. (Rifle :  Echo1 USA ASR Advance Sniper Rifle Bolt Action Sniper Rifle w/ Bipod  ) Now, there is one other rifle you could consider if you just want to stomp everybody without needing to soup up a rifle: The Novritsch SSG 24 Designed by an Austrian(I think) airsofter who was sick of having to always tinker with his guns to get insane performance, he went and created a rifle that out of the box is capable of shooting 250+ feet no problem. The rifle comes stock with precision machined internals and externals, which gives extreme durability and can handle insane power such as an M190 spring (600+ FPS). And also comes stock with a tightbore barrel. It\u2019s essentially built to be the perfect out-of-the-box rifle, of course running almost $500 means it\u2019s not for everybody. He also runs his own youtube channel of airsoft sniper gameplay so you can see firsthand how the SSG24 performs in some of his videos. I don\u2019t own it, so I won\u2019t say it\u2019s the best, but I\u2019ve watched hours of videos of people playing it, so I\u2019m pretty confident it\u2019s at the very least really good. Here\u2019s his website if you want to take a look around Novritsch SSG24 Airsoft Sniper Rifle I hope this helps! How do you take out an airsoft sniper? How much does a CYMA M14 airsoft rifle cost? What is RIS in Airsoft rifles? How does an Airsoft Tracer Unit work? Would a scout/recon in Airsoft maybe use a sniper rifle or a gillie suit? There are practically none, at least not stock. If you\u2019re serious about being an airsoft sniper, be prepared to spend hundreds of Euros and a lot of time to either find or build a good rifle. That being said, there are a few options TM VSR-10/JG BAR-10 I\u2019m mentioning these in one breath as they\u2019re basically the same gun, only by different manufacturers. The VSR is hands-down THE most popular airsoft sniper platform, nothing else even comes close. This means there\u2019s a heap of aftermarket parts available which can turn your VSR into an absolute beast. We\u2019re talking over 100 metres of range, accurately. Buy the TM if you value externals, and maybe if you want to keep using some of the stock parts, go for the JG otherwise. It will save you a couple of 100 Euros which you can sink into some much needed upgrades. The JG spring is pretty decent, so you can keep it in if you want. There are a lot of other brands that make VSR-clones as well, be sure to check them out. WELL L96 Not quite as popular as the VSR, but still has a pretty decent range of upgrades available. All of the important stuff is there: barrels, teflon coated bolts, 90-degree triggers, hop up units and so on. Fully upgraded, it should probably have around the same range as the VSR, though parts might not be as easy to come by. Also be sure to check out Novritsch\u2019s website over here:  Shop - Novritsch | Airsoft Sniper , it has upgrade kits for most popular sniper rifles. Of course, you could order his SSG24\u2026. but what would be the fun in that? ;) For what price? I imagine if your going in at a low price point the Crosman Gameface GF529 is a great $80 sniper that I personally use and love. This is the best priced low level entry sniper. Put this scope on this bad boy, the Discovery VT-3 4-16X44SFVF, an easy $45 scope at Academy sports or something similar and you've got yourself an amazing setup. In my opinion, there are two Tokyo Marui VSR-10 This is probably the most popular and easily upgradable sniper platform. It has okay stock performance, but throw a few aftermarket parts in and you've got yourself a rifle that will easily outrange any AEG. Also, its TM, so you know it'll be decent quality The other is the Novritsch SSG-24 This is a rifle designed by the YouTuber Novritsch, who is an incredibly talented airsoft sniper. He designed it to be basically perfect and require no upgrades. It is also compatible with VSR-10 parts, so if you want to upgrade it further you can. The only issue is that it runs for about $500 Truthfully and simply stated, any airsoft bolt-action sniper rifle that\u2019s TM compatible. Tokyo Marui (TM) is the godfather of airsoft, and with that most manufactures make guns and parts with compatibility with TM in mind. So start off by looking for a gun that\u2019s as TM compatible as possible.  From there, it mainly goes by how easy spare and replacement parts and magazines are to find. And of course the most important factor, what you like best. Personally I recommend the TM VSR-10, but you can also grab the JG Bar-10, Echo M28, and Echo ASR just to name a few, which are all (internally) clones of the VSR-10. The L96 is another option as well. Whatever you grab, don\u2019t worry about the velocity out of the box. Day 1, you\u2019re going to gut the internals and re-build it from the ground up. You\u2019ll keep a few parts, but the rest of it, you\u2019ll throw to the side for higher end more robust parts capable of bearing the load from the heavy spring you\u2019re going to toss in the gun. In terms of guns, as aforementioned the VSR-10 (M28) and any of the clones are good choices, the L96 is another popular one. I\u2019ve been seeing more SVDs on the field as well, parts are fairly easy to find with that gun as well.  But again, buy a gun with the expectation of gutting it and re-building from the ground up. A bolt-action out of the box is just a smidgen more accurate and obtains a smidgen more range than your average AEG out of the box.",

I prepared using these books: Introduction to psychology by  Morgan and King Social psychology by  Baron and Byrne Synopsis of Psychiatry by  Kaplan and Sadock  (it includes chapters on psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, neuro-cognitive illnesses, etc. as well, and for an entrance exam, this one book will be enough on those topics) Research Methodology: Book by  C. R. Kothari ICD Go through all your  practical records  and familiarize with the psychometric testings, the scores, etc. Basically go through all you have learnt in your UG and PG. I made notes from all of these in two ways. One was a point by point note of each chapter. Second was the theories, corresponding names of those who devised them and the year. This helped me in the last minute revision. It took me a while to do so, because a few of these books are really extensive. Start preparing a lot before the exam so you will have time to revise as well. All these books are still available at newer editions from what I have used. Goodluck on your entrance exam. I did not really prepare much for it. Emphasis on certain areas are really specific to the places you apply to. Let me share what I remember about them NIMHANS- General psychology, testing (kahn and giffin), research methods, therapies, bio psychology On testing I remember a question on the symbols of Rorschach\u2019s Klopher system and one on WISC hold and no hold test that came in both the years I wrote the exam. There were also some very technical questions on research methods and therapies. One or two on bio psych. There was a question on narrative therapy as well CIP- Mostly if you read Morgan and King in detail you are good. I remember questions about primary and secondary gains in both years. As well as one on alcoholism. Study the cognitive functions chapters thoroughly. IHBAS- Lots of questions on biological psychology and social psychology in my year. Interview questions depend on your luck. I got asked why is the IQ cut off 70. Something I found an answer to in the second year of MPhil. In sum, Morgan and King- focus on the cognitive chapters and social psychology Research methods focusing on research designs a book where testing is described in detail like Psychological assessments or Kahn and Giffin - look at WISC or WAIS first one - hold and no hold test, Rorschach codes for determinants remember NIMHANS follows Klopher the others follow Exner. a book on clinical psychology Ideally a book which gives an overview of therapies I hope this helps. Wish you the very best of luck.",

In fact, if the project has a high level of uncertainty, it would probably be a mistake to use an SDLC at all and you might be better off using an Agile or iterative development approach that doesn\u2019t have a formal SDLC. Chuck Cobb Author of \"The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile\" Check out:  Agile Project Management Training Online for Project Managers There is no one SDLC. There are many representations of the various steps and the relationships between the steps. In some models, the steps are sequential. In others, they are iterative and incremental. One common breakdown of phases does include 5: Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Maintenance. Another common breakdown also contains 5 phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Test, Maintenance. A more detailed breakdown consists of Initiation, Concept Development, Planning, Analysis, Design, Development, Integration and Test, Deployment, Operations and Maintenance, and Disposition. There are plenty of other ways to decompose the various activities that compose the lifecycle of a system.",

        "a": "Anyone who could own a pig. Which is an attention-grabbing version of: Any ordinary man or woman who would not look out of place in a church or pub. The subject\u2019s wiki entry has more precise answers for you and begins: English Renaissance theatre, also known as early modern English theatre, or (commonly) as Elizabethan theatre, refers to the theatre of England between 1562 and 1642.  [1] It\u2019s worth understanding the context of those Elizabethan Playhouses. These performed the plays of Shakespeare, Jonson and Marlow described in the WIki, but they were built out of a demand for theatre, and you can trace this demand back to  Medieval theatre   [2] A significant forerunner of the development of Elizabethan drama was the Chambers of Rhetoric in the Low Countries. These societies were concerned with poetry, music and drama and held contests to see which society could compose the best drama in relation to a question posed.  [3] Which is significant to me because it reminds me of the  Mystery plays  we were required to study as undergraduates of Theatre Studies in 2012: These vernacular religious performances were, in some of the larger cities in England such as York, performed and produced by guilds, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control originated the term mystery play or mysteries, from the Latin ministerium meaning \"occupation\" (i.e. that of the guilds). The genre was again banned, following the Reformation and the establishment of the Church of England in 1534.  [4] From the origins of drama up until modern times, any free person could visit a theatre. Unless your social status was very low indeed, you could expect to gain entry, with no formal attire or rank. \u201cToo low\u201d to gain entrance might include: noticeably insane; covered in shit; unaccompanied females of any social status. The bar is that low. Theatres have always had a shady reputation. They are often closed down by heavy handed dictators, along with brothels, ale houses. Playhouses in Elizabethan times were never too posh. It was the other way round, with gentry slumming it - albeit from their corporate boxes. Even up into Victorian times theatres were seedy places for middle class to attend. They were seen as mildly sinful by the church. (That never stopped anyone.) Formal theatre is a Greek invention: The same culture which invented the idea of \u201ccitizen\u201d. The first plays were written by Greek playwrights like  Phrynichus  who were educated amateurs. They wrote for civic run competitions and religious festivals. Theatre has always been a social event which everyone attends (where everyone means anyone who can buy pig or most people who can buy a pint). Study any part of human history and you will find theatre is a central facet of ordinary people\u2019s lives. Elizabethan times were no different. A visiting theatre troupe or a trip to the theatre was an important event in the social calendar. Travelling actors didn\u2019t just bring entertainment, they also brought news and spread fashions or gossip about court affairs. Theatres were places to flirt and get yourself noticed. Price has never been an object. In Elizabethan playhouses the cheapest ticket was a penny   (less than 2 quid in modern money - where 1 of your \u201cquids\u201d buys a regional newspaper). There were viewing areas from the stands to the royal box, with tickets priced for everyone (just like the jousting tournaments of medieval times). Manual workers, sex workers, bankers, lawyers and lords could afford to visit a theatre, without not look out of place (in their place). No doubt, reprobates and child pickpockets slipped passed the ushers unnoticed in the late 1500s - even today such a thing is not unknown. So anyone could visit the theatres of Britain in Elizabeth times, and it\u2019s always been that way. In the late 1900s English theatre seemed in danger of gentrification but regional theatres still find ways to encourage people from all social backgrounds to attend. Notice that even London Musicals - with prices like a weeks salary for ordinary people - still attract audiences regardless of class. Unfortunately tradition theatre is not so popular in our century, but this is unusual. Until more recently, theatre has always been a central part of commoner life in England (and Europe, and beyond); and this fact lies behind the sound of those bemoaning the death of theatre in England. In Elizabethan England anyone could visit the theatre, and many did.

        "a": "Well a bit of a pedantic comment on the question, a kegerator does not really need a carbon dioxide (CO2) [tank], but the beer inside does for it to flow and to stay carbonated. As described in the following link from the AHA,  An Introduction to Kegging Homebrew - American Homebrewers Association :  CO2 is the gas used to carbonate and push out the beer into your glass . If you have a carbonated beer in a keg (commercial or homebrew) it will only have a certain amount of CO2 gas in the keg, depending on style\u2019s suggested serving temperature. As you dispense the beer the CO2 expands and pushed the beer up the tube and down the spout\u2026 eventually you end up with a closed keg with a smaller amount of beer and a proportionally smaller amount of CO2. Because you have used up some of the CO2, the pressure in the keg will drop a small amount and the beer will lose carbonation and the gas will come out to fill that space; do this enough times and eventually you will get a flat tasting beer; a few more times and even though there is beer in the keg there wont be enough energy (read pressure) in the keg to push the beer out to your glass. Keeping your keg with a CO2 attached helps keep the pressure at the same level in your keg. This keeps the same amount of CO2 dissolved in your beer and helps push it up the lines. Keeping a keg always balanced is not easy, but it is not essential to enjoy a good beer; if you are interested you can read this AHA document: https://www.homebrewersassociati... Cheers! How do you make CO2 gas? Where can I fill up my CO2 tank for a kegerator? How big would a CO2 cloud need to be to be deadly? How do I adjust CO2 on a kegerator? How do lime water and CO2 react? Because beer in a keg has very little pressure on it. If you tapped it, you'd get a little bit of beer out, then it would stop. To get all the beer out, you must push it out by replacing the volume of beer you draw with something else. At a party, this is accomplished by pumping air into the keg With the pump atop the tap. And that air you pump into the keg is pushing down on the surface of the bee, pushing it out the tap into your glass. This works well for the average party lasting 4\u20138 hours. But air contains oxygen. And oxygen will chemically react with beer, and after as little as 12 hours give the beer an \u201c\"off flavor\u201d - typically described as resembling wet cardboard. But co2 has flavor that is already in the beer ad a product of fermentation. So pushing the beer out with CO2 has less discernible effect. Especially important in bars and restaurants where a new keg can take a week or more to run dry. Carbonation is pressurized CO2 dissolved in liquid. When the pressure is released by opening the bottle, can, or dispensing from a keg, the CO2 starts to come out of solution and bubbles. As the beer warms, more and more CO2 comes out of solution until eventually the beer in your glass goes flat. If you\u2019ve ever tasted a flat beer or soda, it simply isn\u2019t near as good as a properly carbonated one. But of course, to dispense the pressurized beer and keep it carbonated. Same as with a bar\u2019s tap. I have a 100% CO2 as well as mixed gas setup for \u201cnormal\u201d and Nitro style beers respectively. For either setup, a fixed pressure on your beer will keep it at the same carbonation level and freshness. With a relatively short beer line, like what will be in your kegerator, you should have it set between 7\u201310psi depending on how you want your beer to flow into the glass. The higher pressure, the more foaming will occur in your beer. The light beer you find at the store will be at higher carbonation levels both to make up for their lack of body and because they will not foam as much as a nice premium beer you buy or brew. I also mentioned freshness, and this is due to the wonderful property of CO2 in that nothing that could harm or spoil your beer can thrive in it. You can get a small CO2 canister, not unlike those used for paintball, and fill it a few times a year (dependent of course on how much beer you enjoy) or you can find a local welding store and rent/buy a 10 or even 20lb food grade C02 canister and not have to worry about filling it for 1\u20132yrs. I went with the second approach and am very happy with it. Surprisingly, the fill price is almost the same no matter the size of the tank so it is economical to go with the larger tank if you have the space.",

        "a": "Boron is uses as a neutron poison because of its neutron absorbing properties. Absorbing neutrons is important to control the excess reactivity of a reactor core due to having more mass at beginning of life than needed for criticality. Boron can be present in a nuclear core in a few ways. It can be added to the reactor coolant in the form of boric acid. It can also be built into the core in boron carbide assemblies in order to control neutron flux at certain places in a reactor core to try to even out the flux that may be misshapen from control rods. Adjusting boron concentration is just like adjusting control rod height. Each has the affect of changing core temperature. As the fuel burns out, boron concentration is lowered by adding water to the coolant to dilute the mix. Otherwise, temperature will fall as the fuel burns out. What is used in a nuclear reactor? Why do a few of the nuclear reactors in India use thorium as fuel? Can we use a nuclear reactor to transform a rock into a car? How is a nuclear reactor made? Why doen't NASA use nuclear reactors? When a PWR/BWR reactor is running on fresh fuel, its has the tendency to produce more neutrons than it needs, cause over time, neutron production comes down. Typically reactors must be refueled cause they can no longer produce enough neutrons to sustain fission. Boron is used to absorb the extra neutrons produced to keep the reactor producing just as many neutrons as it consumes (criticality). There are other reactor designs that can start up with very little excess reactivity (excess reactivity = capacity to produce more neutrons than required for balance), and that can use thermal expansion/contraction as its primary tool to regulate neutron production (negative temperature coefficient). One such type of reactor is the MSR (Molten Salt Reactor). Such reactors don\u2019t need boron in normal operations, using it just as an emergency feature to quickly shutdown the reactor in an emergency. This allows MSRs to run on lower enrichment fuel, and to produce less spent fuel (aka nuclear waste) than typical reactors. Boron is used both in reactor control rods and injected into the coolant when a lot of neutron absorption is needed. Thorium also helps reduce Boron/Gadolinium requirements. In common reactors (thermal spectrum ones), using Thorium in the place of U238 as the fertile of a reactor flattens the power curve over time, which reduces the level of fissile needed at reactor startup (typically U235 or Pu239). This is due to U238->Pu239 thermal fission producing an effective 1.9 neutrons per neutron consumed, while Th232->U233 thermal fission produces an effective 2.45 neutrons per neutron consumed. Boron 10, which is about 20% of elemental boron, is one of the best neutron absorbers. It is dissolved in the cooling water of power plants to control the chain reaction, to absorb enough neutrons to remove excess reactivity in PWR plants. It is used in control rods in both BWR and PWR plants to control reactivity and/or to change the power shape in the core. Neutron detectors often contain boron. The B10 absorbs a neutron emitting an alpha and the ionization caused by the alpha is measured (either in counts or current).",

However, if Jon chose a path that Sansa thought would endanger the Stark family and its position in the North, then I believe she is now capable of acting independently. It may seem telling that Sansa currently has a schemer and a betrayer of trusts for a tutor. But let's not forget who her father was. Ned Stark continues to influence his children, and the entire long-remembering North, from beyond the grave. When Sansa thinks about protecting House Stark, she thinks about it because the Starks have earned the right to rule by having ruled well for thousands of years. In short, Sansa is not Cersei; but if Littlefinger oversteps his bounds (and he will), Sansa will remember who it was that betrayed her father to his eventual death (and she will). And that is how Littlefinger will die. (Remember, you heard it here first.) :) Now, to the coming events in the cold heart of winter: It is as obvious to Sansa as to Jon that the North must unite - MUST unite - to face the real peril of the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead. \u201cIt\u2019s even worse than we thought. The Night King is Tim Burton!\u201d - Jon Snow You have phrased your question to test whether becoming Queen in the North is Sansa's main goal. I agree it has to be one of her fondest dreams, but the realist she is now would never let a dream founded in pre-adolescent naivete overthrow the dire realities she understands now. The dream of courtly splendor, after all, nearly got her raped or killed any number of times in King's Landing. Theoretically, then, Sansa could act apart from Jon Snow; but under present circumstances - the existential scale of the threat facing them - I do not believe there is any chance that she will. her dream is to save Winterfell and to save the Starks. Besides, Sansa knows she would only be queen for as long as it took the White Walkers to find a way past the Wall and reach Winterfell. And they will. Is Jon Snow really dead? What's his fate? Is Sansa a Stark? Which King in the North crowning scene did you like better: Robb Stark's or Jon Snow's? What evidence is there that Jon Snow is not Ned Stark's son? (in  Game of Thrones ) Is Sansa Stark playing games even with Jon Snow? Why did she lie to him about how she heard about the Tully forces? She would have to be acclaimed as Queen in the North in yet another gathering of the lords of The North. This is not an inherited title, it would not pass to her if Jon died. And I\u2019m not sure why she would want to. Currently she is Lady of Winterfell. Jon did not inherit this seat of power, Sansa did. Jon has a different title, one with different rights and responsibilities. Presumably Jon is going to ride off anyway, leading the northern lords and the allied Wildlings to the Wall in hopes of holding it against the Others. His \u201ccastle\u201d is going to be Castle Black. Until it falls\u2026 This basic question has been asked a couple of times before on Quora: Do you think Sansa would plan something against Jon? Basing from the last episode, I think she wasn't given enough credit. Will Sansa Stark marry Jon Snow to be queen since she is desperate to be one? My short answer is \u201cNo.\u201d The reasons I say that can be found here: Kasey Coff's answer to Do you think Sansa would plan something against Jon? Basing from the last episode, I think she wasn't given enough credit. \u2026and here: Kasey Coff's answer to Will Sansa Stark marry Jon Snow to be queen since she is desperate to be one? Having re-read my answers this morning, I will stand by them. I also might add that I\u2019m finding it increasingly likely Sansa will never marry again. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s after power in and of itself: I think if Jon remains King in the North* she will become Wardeness of the North, in her own right. She will take on that role out of duty to her family\u2019s history, not because she\u2019s interested in wielding power. *I don\u2019t think Jon will remain King in the North. By the end of the series, I have a hunch that Jon will be dead - and this time, will not be revived. I also think the Seven Kingdoms will technically be reunited, with Daenerys the nominal ruler. Though I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be much left to rule after the war, the White Walkers, winter, and the dragons get done. There have been endless variations on this question, and they always make me wonder: what is it that the questioner has seen in Sansa over the past 6 seasons that makes him or her think that she would betray her family in order to gain power? People bring up her wanting to be Joffrey\u2019s queen in season one, and telling Cersei about Ned\u2019s plan to leave King\u2019s Landing, but #1, she was a naive child then and had no idea of the repercussions of her actions - certainly had she known that they would contribute to her father\u2019s imprisonment and eventual execution, I think it\u2019s safe to assume that she would have kept her mouth shut - and #2, she never wanted to be Queen in order to wield power, she just had romantic notions about what she thought being Queen would be - feasts and pretty gowns and court gossip and raising little princes and princesses. Everything about Sansa\u2019s story arc in season 6 suggests that she has come a very long way from that naive, spoiled little girl from season 1. She has an appreciation for her home and her family that she didn\u2019t have back then. Her interactions with Jon give no indication that she is jealous of him or that she wants to be Queen in the North. And in fact, it\u2019s advantageous for Sansa for Jon to be named as King rather than her as Queen, because if Jon is the ruler in the North, Littlefinger\u2019s plan to marry Sansa to gain control in the North can\u2019t happen. Do I think she might initially pretend to go along with Littlefinger as a means to ultimately take him down? Yes, and I think the show might try to make us think that she\u2019s going to betray Jon (in fact, the producers as well as Sophie have already tried to head us in that direction, which makes me believe it\u2019s likely a red herring). But no, I don\u2019t believe that Sansa is ultimately going to betray her brother. It\u2019s just not who she is. My opinion is strictly based off what I\u2019ve seen and understood from show-Sansa. I have not finished reading the books, so I cannot draw judgement from the source material. A Better Question: What does Sansa get from being Queen in the North? Honestly, nothing. Sansa\u2019s true motivations are not power but protecting her family, her ancestral home, the North, and revenge. Things never come easy. To recapture Winterfell, Sansa knew Rickon had to die because there was no hope of saving him unscathed. The Sansa pre-season five would have foolishly tried and, just like Jon, jeopardized the battle. I always thought Sansa\u2019s motivations (post-season one) were not the Iron Throne but  revenge . Deep down, Sansa has a deep hatred towards the Lannisters, the Boltons, and Littlefinger. To me, Sansa, in the beginning, was the weakest of the Starks because her gender and na\u00efvety made her vulnerable towards abuse and manipulation. Things have changed, as depicted in season six, and Sansa has started to show signs of divergence from her father\u2019s ideology of honor above all else. If you don\u2019t believe this, then rewatch the ending of the Battle of the Bastards (season six, episode nine). Ned Stark, one of my least favourite characters in the show and books, would not have allowed Ramsay to be devoured by his own dogs because it\u2019s not\u2026 honourable? This is pure guesswork so take it with a grain of salt. I don\u2019t think Sansa will betray Jon but there is a chance the two of them will have some sort of friction during season seven. Jon\u2019s main priority is rallying a strong army to defend the North (and Westeros) from the White Walkers. Sansa, on the other hand, will shift her gaze towards the south, to King\u2019s Landing, to the Irone Throne now occupied by the tyrant who made her life miserable, Cersei Lannister. This is the opening Littlefinger is hoping to exploit in order to undermine Jon\u2019s rule and eventually give Sansa the northern crown, which he hopes to rule the North through her. It\u2019s a double-edged sword and I\u2019m not ruling out the possibility that Sansa is using this as a ploy to destroy Baelish. Sansa may have discovered her hidden talent and could potentially be a lot more machiavellian than Littlefinger. I learned one important thing from Littlefinger: the person sitting on the throne is not the most dangerous man (or woman) in the room.",

Project Management Professional (PMP) is the most sought-after project management certification around the world. PMP certification imparts in-depth knowledge in handling of projects with planning, scheduling, controlling and monitoring and closing out the project. PMI\u00ae the parent organization continuously works with the enterprises and academia all over the world to keep the certification relevant to address changing business demands. 15.7 million new Project Management jobs by 2020. Economic footprint of the Project Management profession to grow by $6.1 trillion, in the same period. A whopping 37% increase in the output of project-intensive industries, such as Manufacturing, Finance, ONG, Construction, and IT. \u00a0 \u00a0Certified PMPs take home an average salary of $109,405 In a world where the median household income of the largest economy on earth, that of the United States, is $50,500, that entry-level PMPs \u2013that\u2019s certified Project Management Professionals- make over twice as much money in a year is quite telling. According to the PMI\u2019s \u201cProject Management Salary Survey 8th Edition\u201d, PMP credential holders will earn nearly 17% more salary than their uncertified counterparts. Having a PMP credential demonstrates that you can understand the global project management language.

Candidate is either well known in the company\u2019s industry of interest, possesses high expertise in that field, or both. I am currsntly looking for work in Canada and this is my observation from Canada. For any project manager roles, PMP is a required qualification, a benchmark if you may. It helps you get one step closer to an interview. So, yes it does help. However, this observation is country-specific. The best way to determine if having fhe PMP will help you would be to look at potential job postings you are inferested in and see what are the requirements for the role. If you see PMP as a required qualification on more than 50% of the jobs you see, you have your answer! We care deeply. I work in a PMO for a large city. When we ask for bids/proposals for large purchases/projects, we not only staff those projects with PMP\u2019s, we tell the vendors during the RFP process that we expect them to manage the project implementation using PMI standards. We expect them to staff their side of the project with PMP\u2019s and mark them down if they can\u2019t provide the appropriate level of staffing; quite possibly costing them a successful bid. They lose our business if they can\u2019t deliver on this requirement. We see PMI standards as a requirement for doing business with the city. We see PMI standards as a way to ensure that we don\u2019t waste citizen money by doing things the wrong way. PMI standards and PMP-level staffing, gives us our best assurance that the projects will be managed professionally and give our citizens the best value for their tax dollars. So yes, we care deeply.

They need shelter, a tent, ground pad or cloth, and sleeping bag. They need some form of camouflage pants, shirt, jacket, underwear, socks, hat, rain poncho, coat, and boots, They need to be able to fight, which will mean a rifle, of some sort, that is reasonably military grade such as: an SKS, AK 47 type, M1 rifle, M1a (M14), Mini-14/30, AR15/M4/M16 type rifle, or at least a good military bolt action like a 1903 Springfield or Moisin-Nagant with several magazines/mag pouches. A solid combat knife is important like a Kbar fighting knife. A good handgun in 9mm or 45 acp is going to be helpful like a 1911 Colt, M9 Beretta, of Glock 17. These would all be helpful for citizen soldiers. Kind of funny, I\u2019m one of three captains in a militia! Surplus Equipment. Depends on what you mean. For example: I myself have a Type 56 SKS, a surplus Chinese paratrooper\u2019s rifle. I also have a Colt 1911 Series \u201870. (It wasn\u2019t really surplus, but 1911s are often considered surplus, I believe, since the military switched to the M92FS in the nineties.) One of the other captains has a real Russian military surplus AK47 (It is an original!!) with a bayonet and a 75 round drum (Take that, Libtards!!). The third captain has an old Winchester shotgun, Gods only know if it was used by the military or not, but the military did use Winchesters at one point. Now, if I wanted a standard issue surplus weapon for all of us, I would want four things. One: Marine Corps surplus M16A4s (Not sure those are surplus yet, but they will be soon. Either way, I\u2019d customize mine to look like one from Vietnam.) Two: Russian Army surplus AK47Ms Three: US Army surplus M24A3s Four: US Army surplus M92FS (Since they\u2019re switching to the P320) Really depends on what you mean by militia. I mean, the British TA is a militia of sorts in that it is voluntary and part time, but it gets the best equipment available as and when it comes, and I held to a high standard-not quite the equal of the regulars, but not that far off as an infantry force, so it isn't really all that distinguishable from the rest of the British Army.",

        "a": "The premise of this question is ever-so-slightly flawed, and that is because socialism is an economic system rather than a governmental system. Socialism itself is simply the collective ownership of industries and the means of production. Nothing more. While the government might get involved, in a political system known as \u201cstate socialism\u201d, this is not the only sort of socialism in existence. I\u2019ll go over a few popular variants of socialism here: Leninism You might notice that I mention Leninism in this list, but not Marxism. The reason for that is because Marxism is more of a philosophy that analyzes class struggle and social transformation more than a political system. Leninism (and Trotskyism, but its economic effects and principles are similar so I don\u2019t include it in this list) is, in a sense, the political application of Marxist theory. In theory, a Marxist-Leninist government would achieved through violent revolution and would be maintained as a \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d- that is to say, an elected multi-member dictatorship which decides social laws. Theoretically, the economy would depend upon workers and labor unions independently organizing the performance of work. Unfortunately, with so much unregulated power in the hands of so few people who claim to be representatives of the proletariat, corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and therefore poor living conditions would run rampant in the form of Stalinism. Stalinism/Maoism Stalinism (and Maoism, its Chinese variant), as I\u2019ve said, is what I consider to be the inevitable outcome of a theoretically Marxist-Leninist government. The \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d would not only determine social policy, but also exercise near-absolute control over the economy. In the Soviet Union, instead of the collective ownership of property, money and goods were often owned by the government to be equally distributed among the populace. Industries were nationalized. While this proved to result in high economic output for the majority of the USSR\u2019s existence, I can\u2019t say that its living conditions were exactly fantastic, since its living standards and overall development lagged behind that of many Western nations. Infrastructure was lacking, incomes and GDP per capita were low, and the poverty rate in the USSR was at least 20% in 1989 compared to about 14% in the US. Stalinism is what a lot of conservatives think of when they hear the word \u201csocialism\u201d. Democratic socialism Whatever Bernie Sanders may say, he\u2019s not really a democratic socialist, since democratic socialism still uses the  socialist  economic system. Like in Marxism, democratic socialism would involve complete worker control of the means of production and a relatively radical shift away from capitalism. The difference is that more emphasis is placed upon a truly democratically elected government with a system of checks and balances. The government would primarily manage social policy and economic regulations on the worker-controlled industries. Social democracy Let me be clear. Social democracy is  not  socialism. I\u2019m including it on this list because many often perceive it as socialism. A social democratic society generates wealth with traditional capitalist means, and control of businesses remains in the hands of one or two people. The difference between social democracy and capitalism is that the government provides social welfare programs and economic regulations in the interest of the general populace. As the name would suggest, the government is democratically elected like in democratic socialism. One benefit of social democracy is that citizens\u2019 quality of life is guaranteed while avoiding the lack of incentive to work that may result from state socialism. Again, social democracy is a system of capitalism, not socialism. I\u2019m only including it on this list because it\u2019s often incorrectly perceived as socialism. There are many more variants of socialism, but those are often the most recognized (and/or most plausible). I was thinking about identifying social anarchism as another variant of socialism, but it\u2019s more of an umbrella term that includes anarcho-communism, anarcho-primitivism, and others. You may draw your own conclusions about the economic and social effects of those governments. I hope this answers your question. Why have socialist governments always been oppressive? Are they using socialist values or are they abusing them? Is a lean socialist government possible? How does a socialist make money? What makes someone a socialist? Will the United States ever collapse? A government is only socialist if it owns the means of production (factories, farms, refineries, mines, etc.). Any government that does not do that is not socialist. It's common for many, both on the left and the right, to refer to the Scandanevian countries as socialist; this is not at all the case. In every case, these nations rank equally or better in economic freedom (a measure of a nation's capitalist tendencies) to the United States. Though they often offer many free social programs (universal healthcare and education, etc.),  they are not  socialist in the sense that the means of production are not owned by the state. This kind of falls into the myth of democratic socialism, but that's an entirely different story.  I'm not a subject matter expert but here's my best answer..., According to the traditional view, a socialist government is a non-revolutionary form of governance that a state or nation has that uses a high degree of economic and social intervention methods to achieve the maximum amount of social justice for is population. What economic or social intervention methods being used by that state or nation to achieve a degree of social justice may vary from one country to the next. For example one nation that may claim to be socialist may have a state ran health care system whereas another may claim to be socialist because it has a complete state subsidized education system all the way up to the university level for its population. In any case, a modern socialist government is usually committed to maintaining socialism by using a representative or democratic form of government within a free market system of enterprise.  A truly genuine socialist government or a government that is called a \"social democracy\" nowadays is Not to be confused with communism or communist forms of government. (although\u00a0 those communist government officials may say they are \"socialist\" for PR reasons) Unlike socialism that became a political ideology more or less through an evolutionary process, Comminism was an ideology that was set down by a man named Karl Marx. He espoused that socialism differs from communism in that communism achieves social justice by having a government that is revolutionary by its very nature, where property is communally or government owned, that does not use a free market system but instead it's economy is centrally planned at the highest level, nor does communism maintain its legitimacy using a truly representative democracy, and where civil liberties are non-existent.  What kind of Socialism? , Market Socialism or Non-market Socialism? , democratic Socialism or Marxist-Leninism? , see? , Socialism are complicated , you have to learn about it to know it fully. But I'll give you the answer , this is the similarity in a Socialist government(non market and market included). A government is socialist when all the means of productions are socialized , or social ownership of the means of productions. 2.A country is Socialist when there are a great deal of direct democracy in that country to allow the people to participate in some simple economic and foreign policies decision , and to eliminate corruption. A country is socialist when Capitalism is eradicated. Socialism is an economic policy where the production and distribution of goods is owned by the government.\u00a0 A pure socialist government owns all industry.\u00a0 However, keep in mind that socialism does not denote any kind of redistribution of wealth.\u00a0 Socialism still does allow for the accumulation of wealth, contrary to the popular belief of most Americans.\u00a0 ",

They share the same ancestor, Proto-Indo-European (PIE). Asian languages have different ancestors, therefore obviously they have different roots. Is Sanskrit the root language for the Indo-European languages? Is English very different than other languages? Why? Which European languages are close to Persian? Why are most Asian and African languages tonal and European languages are not? Which is the root language among Dravidian languages? The languages come from different language trees. European languages are largely part of the Indo-European language tree, where three major \u201cbranches\u201d within Europe are the Slavic (Russian and it\u2019s \u201crelatives\u201d), Romance (Italian, French etc.), and Germanic (English, Scandinavian, German etc.). Noteable exceptions are the Finno-Ugric languages, more noteably Finnish, Sami, and Hungarian, that are not related to the Indo-European languages. Languages such as Chinese and Japanese are not related to the language tree of Europe. They\u2019re not even related to each other (albeit some long-term influences, such as the adoption of the Chinese writing system into Japan, leaving their marks). This is a case for many Asian languages. This is why the word roots are not very similar between them. There is  no  category as an Asian language. There are seven completely different major groups for 4 billion Asians: Indo-European  languages (North Indian and Iranian languages) Sino-Tibetan  languages (Chinese, Tibetan, Indochinese languages) Semitic  languages (Arabic, Hebrew, some Middle East languages) Altaic  languages (Turkish, Mongolian, Tungus, Japanese, Korean) Dravidian  languages (Tamil, Telugu, South Indian languages) Austronesian  languages (Languages of Southeast Asian islands) Caucasian  Languages (tens of Kartvelian or Circassian languages) Let us also note that Altaic, Caucasian and Austronesian language groups are disputed by some linguisticians. There are other smaller language groups such as Andaman island languages. Caucasian is partly in Europe. Of these languages,  Indo-European  languages such as Persian share many roots with European languages. Yet Semitic languages, Dravidian languages and Altaic languages had large impact on Indo-Iranic subgroup and Armenian is too distinct to have recognisable roots. Other 6 groups have very little in common with European languages and do not have common roots with them, except for  loanwords  as a result of Colonialism or more recent  cultural influences . But as pronunciations are radically different, even European words may be  hard to detect  in conversation.",

        "a": "None. If you're already in the National Guard and want to go Active Duty, just go Active Duty Army, after all, you're already in the Army if you're in the Guard! (Remember there's the Army National Guard, and the Air Force National Guard, there is no such thing as the \u201cMarine Corps National Guard\u201d) If you're already a Nat\u2019l Guardsmen it's a straight forward transition to Active Duty, you're already MOSQ'd, dont have to redo BCT or AIT, already know the proper customs and courtesy\u2019s, dont have to relearn new terms (as much as the Marines like to say they're different from the Navy, they sure do insist on using shipboard terms for everything lol) I'm honestly not sure if there's a mandated \u201corientation\u201d or not going from Guard to Active, but basically it's just like switching from part time to full time. If you're NOT already in the Army National Guard, then do not join the ARNG if you plan on going into the USMC later. Besides the Marines making you redo Basic and all the other initial entry training, dont expect to hold onto your rank. If you're a Specialist E4, well that's still a Junior Enlisted, so don't be surprised if they refuse to bring you in higher than a PFC which in the Marines is an E2\u2026.I think even an Army Sergeant E5 going Marines would only be brought in as a Corporal E4\u2026 If you wanna be a Marine, just go to the Marines, there IS such a thing as the Marine Corps Reserve if you really want to do the whole part time \u201c1 weekend a month, 2 weeks a year\u201d thing first. Though there is absolutely no need to do that first before going Active, the vast majority of Marines (and Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen) go straight into Active Duty and never spend a day in the Reserves, perfectly normal. If you really want to join while having serious commitment issues, I'd say your best bet is a 2 year enlistment into the Reserves (assuming the Marines offer such a contract, talk to their Recruiters to find out), you can always reenlist and/or go Active later, if not, well at least you haven't wasted too much of the Corps\u2019 time or money otherwise \u2026 How can I prepare for joining the United States Marine Corps? My 17 year old daughter wants to join the U.S. Marine Corps. Should I let her? I want to join the Marine Corps in a few years, but I'm worried about how God will feel if I kill other people. What should I do? As a French person, how can I join the US Marines Corps? Can you be a part of the US Army Rangers, and then join the United States Marine Corps? You should join the Marines first. I don\u2019t really even see this as an option. There is literally no reason, aside from some personal reason you may have right now, to put off joining the Marines. If you\u2019re in the National Guard right now then start working on your branch transfer now as the release from your command team could take months and you may also have time remaining on your service contract\u2026. satisfy your requirements and get a transfer. Remember, if you\u2019re in right now, you will need to start over in the Marines, completely from scratch, and go through their basic training as a private. You don\u2019t pass go, you don\u2019t collect $200\u2026 you start fresh. Your prior service may matter in terms of some level of retirement at some point in your career but it\u2019s pointlessly worthless in the Marines while you\u2019re serving as they have zero respect for the Army. Do not wait. Do not hesitate. Do it tomorrow. You should join the USMC when you think you are ready for the challenge or trying to become a Marine. The National Guard may help prep you a bit, but you are just as likely to learn bad habits that the Drill Instructors will latch onto during basic. I went to boot camp with a few guys who had been in JROTC. They had several bad habits and the DIs mercilessly worked them over about it. They did know their left foot from their right foot, which was something the rest of us had troubling levels of difficulty distinguishing. You can/should join the Marine Corps ASAP. Why wait at all? I don\u2019t see any big deal advantage for you to delay joining IF you REALLY want to be a Marine. Join the Marine Corps first, you might like it. You might love it. National Guard is also a worthy endeavor. However\u2026. The Marines have a tough reputation, tough training\u2026 deadly deployments\u2026 as a National Guardsmen\u2026 you might get deployed\u2026It is however a Reserve branch of the Army or Air Force. I was deployed twice as a reservist, I'm proud of it, was in the shit both times, but will never regret fighting alongside the US Marines, the best fighting force the world has ever known.

Yes it is satisfactory as unlike any other educational institutes there goes regular classes and the professors are also well qualified.However ,since last few years it has gone down as now there are staffs with laid back attitude and poor manangement.Moreover the managememt is not so good.There are facilities but you would hardly able to know if you are a non hostler. To share my personal experience i too was fasicinated for bhu but having been use to its internal environment and management it has indeed depressed my inner urge for studies.Hardly is there any opportunity for innovation as far as commerce faculty is concerned but one thing to say it focuses only on academics not on overall personality development and open exposure environment which is today very essential for any commerce student. There is many such facilities for students which most of the universities couldn\u2019t provide but bhu could provide at nominal rate .If your priority is university weigtage at global level with abundant facilities in terms of anti ragging, health, liabrary, etc. you are welcome but if you are searching for an overall career development in terms of knowledge, personality, innovative open environment and productive environment you must look for some other and make it a second last option. How good is BHU for an M.Com? How good it is to do MBA from faculty of commerce BHU? Is BHU good for M.A. in English? Is the tag of BHU doing any good to IIT BHU? Is IIT BHU in Varanasi good? Yes, it is good in commerce, more than 30K application received for admission every year. It is one of most popular course of BHU. There is good environment for study and It is a student friendly university. Lots of facilities are provided by university. Here is less involvement of politics. It has learned faculty member and they are very cooperative. There is no doubt on its popularity. Students with one or two year gap also apply. There is entrance based admission process, by scoring 290+ out of 450 you can secure your seat in main campus. Yes. Every year so many students apply for admission in  B.Com . You have to work hard to get in this course because cutoffs are increasing every year . With my personal visit to BHU the environment is not so friendly as there is so much involvement of politics and I visit it personally so this is why I m saying one should think twice before going there gor undergraduate course but it's good for PG and Ph.D",

        "a": "I\u2019d take that  LA Times  article with a grain of salt. Versions of that article are published every year, at this time. Doom and gloom makes good click-bait. And the article is sourced with people that are opposed to the dominance from franchises and sequels. The thesis of that prediction is that the schedule for this summer is completely franchise sequel-based and last year summer sequels did not perform as well as their previous entries. It may be a valid argument that there are some really big budget films coming out this summer that are from aging franchises that aren\u2019t generating the same level of buzz as they once did. I haven\u2019t come across anyone that is excited to see  Pirates of the Caribbean 5  or  Transformers 5 . But there is more to the summer schedule than that. The article cites an expected drop-off of 5-10% for the month of May. On average, 25% of the summer box office is obtained during the month of May, but the variance over the last 30 years has been from 17% to 33%. Let\u2019s take a look at the May and summer domestic box office over the last 30 years. The article is predicting based upon looking at last year. May of 2016 did indeed drop about 20% from May of 2015, partly because of the poor performance of  Through the Looking Glass,  the Johnny Depp led sequel to  Alice in Wonderland . But the summer as a whole stayed flat from the year before. In other words, the importance of May in the summer box office dropped. It went from 26% of the money to 20% of the money. So, how does this summer look? May has had a very well performing  Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2  and a dismally performing  King Arthur . Memorial day weekend adds  Pirates of the Caribbean 5  and  Baywatch . Pirates is an aging franchise. Let\u2019s take a look at its performance. It is on a path of diminishing returns and the last film took a significant drop in the global box-office. Based solely on this data, I would agree that Memorial Day Weekend doesn\u2019t look to be a busy weekend at the cinema. Baywatch  is a wild card, though. Although based on an old television series, it is a fresh film franchise. It stars the Rock and he\u2019s a big draw domestically and globally. Baywatch was the most successful television show in the world. Starting the summer on the beach with buff guys and curvy girls is probably a safe bet. The rest of the summer can\u2019t be ignored, though. The kids love  Despicable Me . The second film made 46% more money than the first film. There\u2019s no reason to expect a significant drop-off there. Transformers is another aging franchise. Let\u2019s look at its performance. It is decreasing, but looks like, at least globally, it\u2019s still, unfortunately, a viable franchise. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the fifth film is a domestic disappointment. There are a few big budget films that should feel fresh.  Wonder Woman  is getting a lot of buzz and is expected to do well. Christopher Nolan has a WWII film called  Dunkirk  that has been getting buzz. Combining Tom Cruise and  The Mummy  should be a moneymaker.  Captain Underpants  should bring the kids out. Spider-Man: Homecoming  is a toss-up. There is excitement about Marvel finally getting control of their number one character. His performance in  Civil War  was well received. But, part of the audience is asking why we need a third Spider-man, and the trailer was underwhelming. Pixar\u2019s worst franchise,  Cars , is getting a third film. The second film dropped about 20% in the US, but increased about 20% globally, so who knows how the third will do. There was buzz for  Alien: Covenant , but the reviews have not been kind. And there is a third film in the  Planet of the Apes  series. The second film outperformed the first by 18%, so there isn\u2019t a strong reason to believe the third will under-perform. A few of these aging franchises may just be limping along because they bring in big licensing money (i.e. toy sales), but I think there are still strong franchises. Movie tickets are expensive, knowledge of a sure thing makes ticket purchasing easier. If the entire budget for a Hollywood blockbuster was spent on one CG actor, how realistic would it look? Why do Hollywood blockbusters only account for such a small portion of the box office of India, while they dominate in most other countries? Why is Get Out (2017 movie) such a surprise box-office hit? Did Wet Hot American Summer do well at the box office? Why was the 2015 Memorial Day box office total so low? Predicted by who? Based on? Some movies are going to simply not perform well in every season, and that includes tent pole movies\u2026however\u2026. Guardians II has had 2/3rds of a billion dollars in BO in two weeks. By way of contrast, Guardians I has had about 10% more BO in the entire time since its release. Hard to look at that as any indication that \u201cBig Budget\u201d offerings in general are less in demand or are creating less audience enthusiasm this year as compared to \u201cIn the past\u201d. Each studio runs through cycles of what might be categorized as stake offerings, or simply slim offerings. Universal and Disney/Marvel happen to be killing it now because of exceptional creative and strategic leadership. Warner and Paramount are publicly going through periods of corporate self reflection and in Paramount\u2019s case at least are taking clear steps toward remedying the destructive actions of previous C-suite players. The big answer, Christian, is no. I genuinely think Hollywood isn\u2019t stale. I just thinks that there are platforms that Hollywood needs to start getting into before they screw themselves over. One of the most largest expanding markets right now is direct-to-consumer. There are many problems with that system, as many pirates are just recording those movies right on their laptops and uploading to the internet in HD for free, again screwing over the producers of the movie as they lose much of the profits as many people are going to prefer to see the same thing for free rather than pay money. That being said, if we able to monitor pirates and enforce more strict regulations on piracy, then Hollywood could make its big move for direct-to-consumer, actually expanding sales and \u201ctentpoles\u201d for Hollywood. Netflix is already exploring big budget TV shows and movies direct-to-consumer, with much success. Examples include  Marco Polo, War Machine, Blight,  and   many more other titles. Amazon is doing the same thing, with similar success. Plus, those are predictions. I feel those predictions are totally crap. Do you seriously think with the release of  Wonder Woman, Spiderman: Homecoming, Alien: Covenant, Transformers,  and a few other huge big budget movies, that this summer, we will have the smallest amount of sales? Especially with the expanding global demand for Hollywood movies, I don't think we are going to do any worse we have previously. Remember when all news outlets reported that Hillary Clinton was going to win the elections, Donald Trump had a crazy win and shocked every new outlet in the world? Remember when predictions said that BvS was going to easily make over a billion dollars? This is the same thing. Dont listen to predictions. Just wait until the end and hope for the best. That\u2019s a conservative (some would say cynical or even crankish) interpretation of the data. Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2 is on it\u2019s way to $360 Million domestically. Movies with a chance of topping $200 million in the US this summer include: Pirates of the Caribbean 5 Wonder Woman Transformers 5 The Mummy Cars 3 Despicable Me 3 Spider-man Homecoming War for the Planet of the Apes Dunkirk Valerian The Dark Tower Sure, there are a lot of sequels in there, but that\u2019s because sequels often bring in a lot of audience.",

        "a": "Cook some carrots separately with a stick, and some of the seasonings you used in the original batch. Don\u2019t use a lot of seasonings, just enough to give a little flavor to the carrots. After the carrots have cooked, add them to your original soup, then reduce the stock they cooked in by a third to a half. This will concentrate the flavor of both the carrots and the stock. Once the stock is reduced, add it into the original soup. This should balance out the celeriac with the sweetness of the carrots. To keep it vegetarian, use a vegetable stock. Not broth, as most of those contain salt and reducing a salted broth will intensify the salt and make it unpalatable. There are some very good vegetable stocks available if you don't want to make your own. Good luck and happy eating! How does a skilled cook slice carrots? What foods go along with carrots for juicing? Where do carrot seeds come from? What does celeriac taste like? How do I cook soup? Try sweating an onion and a couple of carrots until they are soft and sweet, then blending them into your soup. If the celeriac isn\u2019t cooked, you can simply simmer the soup for an extra fifteen or twenty minutes. Roasted garlic will also add sweetness and depth. Wrap four or five unpeeled cloves of garlic in foil, bake them for twenty minutes at 375 (F), then squeeze them into a small portion of the soup, bend and retur to the pot. The simplest way to improve the taste may just be to add salt pepper and sugar to it. Add it to a sample first like you did the others and see if it enhances the flavor. Add extra cooked carrots and a dash of honey",

        "a": "This  is true: \u201cSome people make a minimal impact on society and others whilst others go on to change many people\u2019s lives for better or worse.\u201d This  is a value statement, and, as such, it\u2019s subjective: \u201cNot everybody is inherently valuable.\u201d Maybe not everyone is inherently valuable  to you . Albert Einstein revolutionized Physics, and yet my friend John, who hasn\u2019t revolutionized anything, is more valuable  to me . Neither John nor Einstein has  inherent  value. Use the most powerful microscope in the world, and you won\u2019t find value on either of them, anywhere, though be sure to check behind the ears. Let\u2019s look at this as a syllogism: Some people make a minimal impact on society and others whilst others go on to change many people\u2019s lives for better or worse. Therefore, some people are more valuable than others. You can\u2019t derive #2 from #1. There\u2019s a missing premise: Some people make a minimal impact on society and others whilst others go on to change many people\u2019s lives for better or worse. People who make impacts are of greater value than people who don\u2019t. Therefore, some people are more valuable than others. Now  it\u2019s a valid logical argument: valid in form, but the second premise is an  opinion , not an objective fact, so there\u2019s nothing  inherent  going on. This question skirts really close to tautology: Why are these people more valuable? Because they have a greater impact? Yes, it\u2019s true that impactful people are impactful. What should everybody know? Is everybody happy? What does everybody agree upon that you know isn't the truth? What is more valuable than monetary wealth? Is it true that we're all a little racist? I disagree with most of the politically correct views espoused on this thread. Apparently the (socialist) argument goes that every life has value. Pish posh. Nobody is arguing whether human lives have value or not. We are arguing whether they have the same price attached to their lives. Do they? Of course not! Consider this: There is a famous dilemma called the  Trolley Problem  where you have the situation where you need to save either 1 person or 5 people tied to a track. The trolley is going to run over 5 people if left unattended. However by intervening, you can shift the trolley to a different track so that only 1 peron is imperilled. So do you make the change? You could be utilitarian, which hinges on the socialist, politically correct point of view. But realistically, would you? Should you? So let\u2019s say the track with 1 person has this guy: He is Elon Musk. He is trying to  save the world.  He has a lot of new ideas pivoting on Tesla and other ventures which could possibly go on to revolutionise the world and technology the way we know it. He is very valuable to the future of the human race. Now, on the other track, the 5 people are: Osama Bin Laden, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong and the new Head of ISIS. Do you switch tracks? After all their lives are  supposedly equal. So, what does it prove? Human lives are  inherently unequal . Even if the 5 people were ordinary citizens and the 1 person on the other track was a country head or a business tycoon or both like  Donald Trump , that 1 peron\u2019s life is  more valuable than the combined worth of the 5 other people . Here is famous quote by one of the most famous anti-heroes provided by Hollywood flicks: If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it\u2019s all \u2018part of the plan\u2019. But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everyone loses their minds! So that is the reason for such a histrionic reaction. The Joker through his quote makes a strong point. A mayor is more important than some random Tom, Dick or Harry. One guy on the other track might be more important to save than the other 2 or 5 or 100 lying on the doomed rails for that matter. The other 5 may be criminals. In fact the possibilities are endless. If I have a war to win, I will sacrifice a few soldiers than gamble away my general(s). That\u2019s why chess pieces are ranked based on their abilities on the 8\u00d78 checkerboard. That\u2019s why people are rated on the world they live in. That\u2019s why they have different values attached to their lives. Yes, the life of business tycoon or country head is worth more than yours. Is this fair? Maybe not. Is this morally repulsive? Maybe. Perhaps an utopian socialist world order might lead to a 100% utilitarian approach. But the world we live in is  not  utopian. And decisions taken should reflect that.  It should not be simply based on your view of the world or what you desire the world to be.  Or mine. Or anyone else\u2019s for that matter. Because as George Orwell said: All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. And that is how the world is. For better or worse, you decide. I utterly disagree. I believe EVERYONE is inherently valuable. The baby who is born with serious physical disabilities and dies two months after birth is valuable. That baby is not more or less valuable than the CEO who creates jobs and improves the environment over the course of many decades. Value of life is not judged on a scale of what a person accomplishes. The world is made up of over seven billion people, and only a handful of those people (statistically speaking) are CEO\u2019s. The immigrant housekeeper who helps a family where both parents work high-value jobs may be the difference between those parents being able to maintain their success at work along with having time to spend with their children. The violent sex offender is part of a group of people that challenge the rest of us to figure out how to help people, how to keep at-risk people safe, and how to find our humanity and sensitivity when dealing with trauma and the causes of trauma. The Earth will always have serious challenges to face, and humanity will always be tempted to respond in selfish and utilitarian rather than compassionate and cooperative ways. Humanity will always be challenged to see the benefit of looking to the future, when they are faced with a choice between narrow-minded expediency and expansive perspicacity. Expediency sees value in the single thread of gold, and misses the value of the each thread in the whole tapestry. Is the $100,000 car more valuable than the $2,000 car? Not to the poor person who needs a car to get the job to feed, house, and clothe their family. The expensive car is out of their reach, so it has no value for them at all. The mousy, boring child who grows up to be the mousy, boring adult, and dies alone, having accomplished nothing lasting, was an opportunity for someone to reach out and love them. If no one ever did, they represent a missed opportunity, but not a lack of value. Everybody is inherently valuable, even if that value is to the mother who gave birth to them, to the doctor who is researching their fatal disease so future patients will live, or to the nun who cares for the most wretched in Calcutta. From those who seem like they are a burden their entire lives, to those who seem like they are a treasure to everyone they encounter throughout their lives,  everyone is inherently valuable. This I believe. \u201cNot everybody is inherently valuable. Do you agree? Some people make a minimal impact on society and others whilst others go on to change many people\u2019s lives for better or worse.\u201d No. I do not agree. I would argue that your definition of value is lacking. I think many answers have gone into why well enough that I won\u2019t waste my time. However, even with accepting a definition where value is defined as having impact, the question and details contain flawed assumptions. Go visit a graveyard. You might find one person of note out of thousands. Consider how many human beings have lived and died over even just one century. MOST people  make minimal impact on society in a large, notable way. Yet, ALL people  make an impact on an individual level. Impacts on an individual level affect people who go on to impact society. Indeed those that make a huge splash in life, for good or ill, ALWAYS have the \u201clittle people\u201d to thank for it, sometimes generations worth.",

        "a": "Ah, sexuality in Western Civilization. How fickle the understanding of it is. Please understand that sexuality is far more fluid than people like to admit. A heterosexual male might find himself having a crush on a male. A homosexual male might find himself having a crush on a female. Nothing wrong with either situation. This is further compounded by confusing aesthetic attraction, romantic attraction, and sexual attraction. Aesthetic attraction,  is being attracted to someone for their looks. This is superficial, by definition. But it isn\u2019t really a bad thing. Nothing wrong with liking how someone looks. Romantic attraction,  is the desire to start a relationship with a person. Typically these bonds, if mutual, become long-term relationships. Sexual attraction,  is the desire to jump someone\u2019s bones. To want to do the deed. It\u2019s sexual, carnal, lusty. You get the picture. Ideally, people want all three forms of attraction to align before starting \u2018anything serious\u2019. But is there something wrong with feeling only two of these forms of attraction and being curious where that will lead? I don\u2019t think there is. Do not forget, these are only the three more prominent forms of attraction. There is still intellectual attraction, compatibility attraction, etc. Human sexuality and love and all those gooey emotions are far more complex than we give them credit for. How can I stop having a crush on the same person? Do you ever liked a person of the same gender as you? I have a crush that is the same gender as me. Should I confess? If you kiss people of the same gender, are you gay/bisexual? How do I avoid same gender crush? Sexual orientation is not an easy thing to understand. As with many things it exists on a spectrum. No two people really have the exact same sexual orientation. So when we think of what is gay and straight, there are generalities but they can mean different things to different people. You can be straight but have a crush on someone else. This is probably more common than you think. Sometimes it is a celebrity of the same gender that you are attracted to in some way. Other times it is someone in your personal life that you might have a deep connection to. Physical attraction and what I call mental attraction can operate together, but they can also be separate. If they are, they can actual change your perceptions about someone with the other kind of attraction. When I was younger all I really cared about was physical attractiveness, but as I grew up when I was around intelligent and kind people, I saw them as much more physically attractive than I might have before. Of course there is the possibility that you are bisexual as well. It is difficult to tell in many ways. Being attracted to one person of the same gender could be an exception to your orientation. But there are more than 7 billion people on this planet. Who knows how many people are out there that we might be attracted to regardless of what gender they are. This is called idiophilia! You may want to check out The SAGAnthology and the  Tumblr  for it. I know what you're thinking,  it\u2019s Tumblr,  but I promise it's just a dictionary. Best wishes. That depends entirely on you. Do you experience any other attractions? Are you generally attracted to women (let\u2019s assume you\u2019re a man for the sake of this answer), but you\u2019ve found yourself inexplicably attracted to one guy? If so, I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re gay. If you asked me, I\u2019d say you\u2019re a straight guy with a crush on a guy. Stranger things have happened. Our attractions don\u2019t always fit into the neat, tidy little boxes we put ourselves in. That\u2019s okay.",

But a choosing a number of healthy choices each day and making a habit of doing so will help you lose weight. The key to weight loss is what you decide to consume each day\u2026 If you\u2019re consuming processed foods and overeating everyday, you will not lose weight.

Ginger for Weight Loss \u2013 The Studies According to the ancient practice of Ayurveda, eating and drinking ginger root can help keep your weight under control and research has confirmed this as well. In a study published in  the Journal of the Science and Food of Agriculture  in 2014, researchers found that overweight rats who were given gingerol (a compound found in ginger) were able to lose weight after a 30-day supplementation period. The rats also showed improvements to blood sugar levels and leptin levels. 1 Leptin is a compound that plays a role in feeling full and satisfied after a meal and I\u2019ve already covered in great detail the importance of leptin for weight loss. The researchers concluded that ginger supplementation suppresses obesity induced by a high fat diet and it might be a promising adjuvant therapy for the treatment of obesity and its complications. Another study published the prior year in the  European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences  showed that ginger supplementation had an equal impact on rat weight loss as a popular weight-loss medication, Orlistat. Additionally, the ginger caused noteworthy improvements to blood cholesterol level, with \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol levels (HDL) up from their baseline level. 2 With ginger\u2019s power to help you feel full and help you properly digest your food, it\u2019s no wonder that it shows such a strong impact on weight loss. How Ginger Helps Fighting Belly Fat Not only can ginger help with weight maintenance in general, it can also keep that pesky belly fat at bay. Ginger can target the main reasons that belly fat accumulates, such as overeating, hormonal changes and low energy leading to lack of exercise. Ginger helps you to feel full, so eating ginger or drinking ginger water can help curb the urge to overeat. As a natural appetite suppressant, consuming ginger is one of the best ways to aid in the weight loss process. An additional advantage is that ginger is nearly calorie free and can be used fresh, in cooking and brewing in tea. Hormonal changes and chronic stress can cause spikes in levels of blood cortisol, which throws the immune system and metabolism out of balance. According to an article in the  Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin  of 2004, ginger suppresses cortisol production. 3 Elevated levels of cortisol may contribute to weight gain, especially making it hard to lose belly fat, and I\u2019ve mentioned it in my article on how to reset your hormones to lose weight and in my article on how to lose belly fat without exercise. Consuming ginger can help bring the internal balance back in tune and promote well-being and weight loss. Ginger\u2019s sharp, distinctive flavor can also help naturally boost your energy levels, both physically and mentally. Ginger Increases Your Metabolism A study published in  Metabolism  in 2012 found that ginger has a thermogenic effect by enhancing the thermic effect of food as well as promoting feelings of satiety. 4 Thermogenic food means that it raises the temperature of the body and helps boost metabolism and calorie burning. In the thermogenesis process the body burns calories to utilize foods you have just consumed, converting those calories to heat. The  International Journal of Obesity  mentions that consuming foods that have thermogenic effect can potentially be a tool for weight loss and weight maintenance as they may increase energy expenditure, fat oxidation and counteract the decrease in metabolic rate that happens during weight loss. 5 The study assessed the effects of consuming a breakfast meal with or without a hot ginger beverage (2 g ginger powder dissolved in a hot water) on energy expenditure, feelings of appetite and satiety in overweight men. The study found that there was a significant effect of ginger on thermic effect of food, and the participants showed lower hunger, lower food intake and greater fullness with ginger consumption versus the control group. The results suggest a potential role of ginger in weight management. 4 How to Use Ginger for Weight Loss If you want to use the healing powers of ginger to lose weight, here\u2019s what to do.details here, Pure Asian Garcinia A caloric deficit helps with weight loss.

Clothes? Music? Boys of eleven are really difficult to engage when it comes to language learning. The trick is to make it fun so it doesn\u2019t feel like study. Years ago I used to teach a group of high school preparation students and one of their favourite activities in class was watching \u2018The Simpsons\u2019. I let them do this because I designed a listening comprehension activity for every episode and the deal was that they had to get most of the questions right or they couldn\u2019t watch the next episode. The questions included filling in gaps in the dialogue, asking what different characters were doing and thinking, asking what different words might have meant, how the episode started, what elements were in the background, colours of objects, etc. The kids loved it and they learned so much. For developing spoken fluency, ask your student to tell you about his hobbies, teach him the vocabulary, as well as the pronunciation, and show him how to discuss these topics within the framework of sentences. You can show him short videos of sports heroes talking, or games in progress, and together you can describe what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s important to get him talking, even if his vocabulary is very limited to begin with. You can extend this kind of activity by getting him to write about what he\u2019s watching and also read a related text. What you\u2019re aiming for is to get all 4 skills - reading, writing, speaking and listening - working together so that they are constantly reinforcing each other. Games are another way of engaging his interest - board games, card games, computer games, for example. All these activities involve a lot of useful vocabulary and grammar structures that are transferable into other areas of daily life. Hope this helps! Why are many Chinese people poor at speaking English, despite years of learning? I am a 24-year-old Chinese girl, and I can only speak Chinese and English.

You can get hold of a textbook and use that as a guide - covering a chapter a week - each chapter focuses on a grammatical concept and includes some new vocabulary. You don't say what your home language is - if it's English then instruction will have to be in English. Introduce him to youtube and cartoons - cartoons are a good help to learning a language. Assign him some cartoons to watch each week. He should spend some time every day with English - watching cartoons for 15-20 minutes - even if he watches the same cartoon over and over. Ideally you would have introduced him to the vocabulary in the cartoon. When he comes back the next week for his lesson, ask him to tell you about the cartoon as best he can. What happened in the cartoon? Ideally find a series of cartoons he likes - and use that as a foundation for listening skills and have him write some sentences every week - short sentences that you can go over together and correct. There is a whole course of study around teaching people a second language. Teaching English as a second language is actually a profession. For a wide variety of resources, you can Google \u2018ESL\u2019 and find a lot of information including courses to take. Of course, you don\u2019t mention what you have been hired to tutor him in. If it\u2019s not English, then I suggest you should teach him with a lot of patience and understanding that he probably doesn\u2019t understand a lot of what you are saying. You fail to provide some critical information: What country is this in, i.e. what is the official language of the country in which he is expected to live and do business when he becomes an adult? What language did the parents hire you to teach him in? If he is the child of immigrants to an English-speaking country where as an adult he will have to conduct business in English, I suggest you teach him in English to help him learn the language. My own first language is Pennsylvania Dutch/German, which I spoke until I started Grade 1 at age 7 and still speak with family. My English was extremely limited but my teacher spoke only English and I learned. As a child of a historic Mennonite community where this specific German dialect has always been spoken in the home and community, I was far from the only child entering school with a limited English vocabulary. All of us learned by exposure. The pictures and discussion of pictures in first grade Readers and Phonics workbooks must have been immensely helpful, though I hardly remember those days. Also, be aware that a child understands much more of a language than he or she can express verbally. Be sympathetic to this and help him learn. One example I clearly remember. The teacher had said if we had missed a day of school to bring her a note explaining the reason. One day I was sick and missed a day of school. The next day, we first graders were sitting in a half circle on the floor for reading lesson and the teacher asked if I had a note. I said I did, thinking her question meant, \u201cCan you explain why you were absent yesterday?\u201d \u201cWhere is it?\u201d she asked. I was stumped by the \u201cwhere\u201d question; I was prepared to explain the \u201cwhy\u201d part. My classmate (who had older siblings and knew more English) sat next to me and whispered in my ear the German word for note and my mind lit up. I did not have a note but I knew my mother could write one. The teacher seemed to understand and said to bring one tomorrow, which I did. That is the best advice I know to give; hundreds and hundreds of Mennonite children in Canada learned English when they started school because the teachers understood the situation but taught them in English all the same.",

What tourist areas should be avoided in Southeast Asia? Does Southeast Asia smell? Should I move to Southeast Asia? Will China invade Southeast Asia? It depends on where in Southeast Asia. American English will be understood everywhere. In Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, British English (specifically with Received Pronunciation, aka \u201cBBC English\u201d) has traditionally been the favored and prestigious form because those places were colonized by the British and have had strong cultural and economic relations with Britain until recently (and still do, to an extent). However, especially in Malaysia, American English is gaining ground. American English is also popular in Indonesia. Note that many Southeast Asian countries have their own particular ways of speaking English as a second language, but they should all be intelligible to you after a little exposure to acclimate your ears. Of particular note is Singlish in Singapore, which isn\u2019t really \u201cEnglish\u201d as such, but a creole language based mostly on English, Malay, and southern Chinese languages like Hokkien and Cantonese. You\u2019d have to spend a lot of time in Singapore to even start understanding this one!

However, it is important to remember that Indians need to upgrade their skills in the increasingly competitive global market.The universities and colleges need to impart value-added skills and job-oriented ambience to the students.There should be healthy industry-academicia linkage and better R&D initiatives. c) Taking cue from the recent layoffs in the service sector, the government will overhaul the manufacturing and agricultural sector on a war-footing thus focusing on employment-maximisation.The government knows very well that every year, a million age-eligible Indians join the workforce. A government which came into power riding on the vote-bank of youth brigade cannot afford to neglect their aspirations. Therefore, the government will put all-out efforts to create enabling environment for the manufacturing industries. The passage of GST bill, for instance, would pave the way for the ease of doing business in India and create jobs in upcoming years. d) Agriculture, being the source of livelihood for nearly half of India\u2019s population, will likely move towards scientific and technology-oriented occupation. As the contribution of manufacturing sector towards GDP increases, agriculture sector will become more diverse, remunerative, commercialised and profit-oriented. What is the scope of VFX in India in upcoming years? Can I find a job in India after working for 5 years in Saudi? India: I am a 4th-year, 5-pointer student at IIT Kanpur. I am totally demoralized for the upcoming placement session. Is there any chance for ... Is it worth becoming a pilot in India in the upcoming 4-5 years? How will the job chances in the UAE be in upcoming years? Five years from now, i think the job scenario in India will change significantly. More Focus on Automation with increasing number of tools that are coming in the market, the need for manual labour will significantly decrease. That won\u2019t decrease the number of jobs though, but people will have to upgrade their skills. Roles like project manager, manual tester will vanish and some alternate tool/automation based opportunity will come up. Better R&D Though India is currently an emerging technical hub in the world, but most of the companies currently use India as their back offices, with real development and R&D work being done outside India. Government\u2019s initiatives for faster internet and schemes like \u2018digital India\u2019 will encourage more and more foreign companies to open their R&D centers in India. With reverse brain drain, more tech startups will emerge and opportunities in R&D and software development sector will increase. Opportunities other than IT With the current government focussing more on \u2018Make In India\u2019 initiative, the job in non-IT sectors like manufacturing will increase significantly. A good number of people studying in ECE, Mechanical Engineering etc. won\u2019t have to look for a job in IT sector. Skill Based Hiring To keep up the speed with competitive global market, companies will hire more skilled labour. Freshers will be effected the most in this scenario as there won\u2019t be any mass hiring. We need to understand this fact that India may be Technological Hub in world. But maximum IT sector companies uses India as their back offices as we have store room or basement in our houses. Very less companies take interests in having their  Research & Development  in India. But recently Apple Inc. opened their R&D office in Bengaluru, followed by UBER and other Silicon Valley companies. This comes as a hope to increase employment for each sector in society. After 5 years, I believe that the job opportunities will boom in India for IT sector as Govt is also taking measures to attract more companies to India. Installing Rail-wire wi-fi in Indian Railway Station by Google is all part of the same. Thanks. Job Scenario-Likely Increase in the applicants for government jobs. Due to the sudden increase in the demand for engineers at the starting of this millennium, we saw many new engineering colleges cropping up all over India.Even the number of seats in IIT\u2019s were increased which somehow diluted the quality of our premier institution. So all in all, in pursuit of quantity we have grossly neglected the quality of our engineering graduates. Also IT industry is a progressive industry and you need to constantly update yourself so that you keep pace with the world. Now let\u2019s talk about the  TRUMP  factor. BPO\u2019s form the backbone of our IT industry,previously Indians used to accept $60,000 for the same work that an American would have done for $100,000.But after Donald Trump enforced stricter control and is forcing silicon valley companies to recruit Americans, It is likely that Bangalore\u2019s importance as an strong alternative for Silicon valley will come down. Also, Trump is making it increasingly difficult to obtain an  H1B VISA  and  GREEN CARD.  This has panicked a lot of individuals whose jobs depended upon ON-SITE opportunities. PACKAGE FACTOR It is an open secret that the remuneration that B.Tech graduates were getting has remain static in most of the branches and has even gone down in few of the them (Biotech, Civil, Aerospace). This has led to frustration and frequent job changes among our technocrats. Government as a reliable employee It is with utmost confidence that I can say government is the best employer in India at present. With the arrival of the 7th CPC the salary of a lower and mid-level employee in government sector has grown twice in size than their counterparts in private sector. The perks and facilities were always better in government job and now the salary has also increased in tandem with it. The workload is 10 times lesser in the public sector and promotions are time bound.And if you convert the perks, facilities and salary into CTC it comes to around 25\u201330 lakh rupees for an entry level IAS and 5\u20136 lakh for a Grade-IV driver.This has attracted the attention of many youth who are filling the forms of exam such as UPSC CSE, SSC CGL etc. Final Verdict With a certain recession round the corner and rapid automation of the technical sector it would not be surprising to see youngsters flocking to Old Rajinder Nagar and Karol Bagh to undergo coaching for government jobs. As government has time and again proved to be a reliable employer.",

        "a": "Is it racist or wrong that I was looking at a certain race of people and I found all of them to be unattractive? I was looking at a certain race of people on google and I found all of them to be unattractive and absolutely none of them stood out to me. I am unaware of such a race or ethnicity. Every one that I am aware of has both really ugly and stone cold gorgeous individuals. Do you simply not see yourself ever becoming romantically interested in one of them? Or would you object if a close friend or relative were to date or marry one of them? Could you be friends with one? Would you have any objection to one sitting next to you on a bus or being hired for a job equal to or above you at work? If you distaste extends to situations in which their physical attractiveness should be irrelevant, you might suspect a touch or more of racism. If you would be comfortable with one marrying into your family or social circle since is no skin off your nose, probably not. Which race of men or women do you find most attractive and why? Is it racist to avoid people (of certain races) due to receiving harassment in the past from them? Is it racist to look after your own race more than other races? I think people of same race/tribe have some set of particular traits and I predict (somehow judge) them according to their race/tribe. Am I a ... Does it make me racist for not permitting people of a certain race (or ethnicity) to rent a room from me? A2A. The human race would not have evolved into such obvious categories, such that we can label them as \u201craces\u201d, if we did not all, at one point in history, have your point of view \u2014 \u201cI was looking at a certain race of people and I found all of them to be unattractive.\u201d The key is not to judge people\u2019s intellectual, emotional, or otherwise capabilities and character based on how romantically swoon you are by them. I would further argue that within the race, there are ethnic distinctions that are clear. There are definite cultural differences even with the same race. So for instance, culturally, for some reason or other, even though I am ethnically Han Chinese, I am not at all attracted to the personalities nor looks of Han Chinese men. They look too \u201cfamiliar\u201d to me. I prefer other East Asians. So I think we all need to just calm down about linking racism to romance. People need to be left alone about who they are attracted to or else, we are going to end up in some twisted alternate reality where even LOVE has to be politically correct. You are allowed to find some features nice to look at and attractive, and also to find other features less interesting and not really doing it for you. You are never forced to like someone despite your own preferences. What\u2019s racist is if meet a person, get to know them and then genuinely like them and think there is some chemistry there. And then  decide  not to pursue it because you have this idea that they are unattractive due to their features, even though you really want to have a relationship and sex with them. All of them? Every single one of them? How do you know Google has pictures of every single member of that race? Attractiveness is your taste and opinion. It has nothing to do with right or wrong or racism. Instead of saying all of them are unattractive, why not make it \u201cThose you saw on google were unattractive\u201d without passing judgment and keeping an open mind to someone from that race being attractive (again, in your eyes) in the future. It may or may not ever happen. No. But here\u2019s something very important. Sometimes, google images will find a type of photo, picked by many people, and then it will shove them to the top and the front. For example, I looked up Aboriginal women once, and everything that popped up was fat, old unattractive women. If I didn\u2019t know better, or never really saw Aboriginal women before, I\u2019d think they were all ugly. So\u2026 I youtubed Aboriginal women instead, and typed in Aboriginal models, dark skinned. And lo and behold, some of the most beautiful women I\u2019ve ever seen in my life popped up. And when many Aboriginal women post up themselves, you will see beautiful women. It\u2019s like trying to look up The Moors in the US, which has racial issues right now. Everything that came up was racially Greek or white people with turbans. So, I looked up the Moor\u2019s homeland, Mauritania, and Mauritania music to see what Moors look like. And well, 9 out 10 times, everyone was African looking, dressed in a Mali type style, or styles in the old pictures. Sometimes you can\u2019t trust Google, but have to define further your search. Many times, Google will pop up to the top what a majority of people in a certain region and kind can influence to put up there. Think up what YOU think is attractive in a man, let\u2019s say for example \u201cbig muscles\u201d. (Because all you girlies love big muscles.) And let\u2019s say you love dark eyes. So we type in \u201cdark sexy eyes\u201d. And then the race you looked up. big muscles, dark sexy eyes, (race), enter. Boom, you may be very surprised what pops up. I\u2019ve had women who did not think my race was attractive, and actually were racist against my race, tell me they fell for me. Am I tooting my own horn? No. I embodied what they did not think my race embodied. And I was nice. And I let them know, there were ALOT of men in my race that had what they liked, I wasn\u2019t the only one (which some thought). (You dated someone racist against your race? Yup. Sure did. Then she got kinda\u2026and\u2026well, that story belongs in \u201csome people are crazy\u201d section.) Many women, worldwide, are most attracted to men of their race/culture/religion/heritage, and/or have a aspect of their father-figure. It comes down to a mix of nature and nurture. When women are often taught, like all children, \u201cgroup x is OUR people\u201d, they often grow up preferring \u201cgroup x\u201d. Just naturally, because it\u2019s due to comfort level. So, in the end, refine your search, and try again. And realize, for women, you\u2019re not alone. There are black women who refuse to touch a man who isn\u2019t black, and Asian women who won\u2019t even give a non-Asian guy a chance, or Middle Eastern women who will NEVER EVER date you if you\u2019re not Middle Eastern (or sometimes black), and so on and so forth. But this usually has more to do with his culture, and his \u201cswagger\u201d than his race. If his \u201cstyle\u201d is too different, she probably won\u2019t be attracted. But moreso, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s race. I\u2019d say it\u2019s \u201cyour type.\u201d You have a \u201ctype\u201d, and the men you were looking at weren\u2019t your type. You will find that your type is found in all races, just find your type. Now, my type is gigantic buttcheeks that can pick up a apple like a pair of pliers, and you see- *rock thrown hits him in the head and sends him unconcious across the floor*",

In road cycling, does having a black team jersey (i.e. Team Sky) create any disadvantage in terms of body temperature? How do cycling teams work? How can I start my own Formula One racing team? How do I join or create an obstacle race team? What are some good street racing team names? Oleg Tinkoff pretty much owned the Tinkoff cycling team and treated it like his toy. He abused the riders and claimed he could reneg on their contracts because they weren't performing up to his standards, but had to eat his words when Peter Sagan won a world championship. I think it's down to money. Sky and it's parent company Fox bank roll the cycling team although I do believe the deal is ending soon. Anyone can own a team but it all comes down to the amount of money you have to invest in it and how much sponsorship you can get. I remember reading a quote years ago that described offshore powerboat racing like \u201cstanding in a shower and burning \u00a350 notes\u201d.

When you see the history of Iran, you will understand that America\u2019 policy is always against Iran as it was in 1953 coup, the Iraq\u2019 war against Iran and outrageous sanctions which imposed against Iran. The people of Iran know that America is behind the crimes that were being committed against them inside the country and unfortunately, even in recent decades US has imposed unfair sanctions against Iranians. This policies are rooted in Iran\u2019s opposition to the \u201cexpansionist policies\u201d of the Americans in the region and the \u201ccorrupt moves of the world powers as the leader Iran said. In general, there are four reasons that Iran hates or distrusts the United States. First of that is 1953 coup which was the handiwork of the CIA and a puppet of the U.S got the power. The second reason is the brutal eight-year war of Iraq which America actually assisted Iraq with intelligence. Also Iran Air 655 is another reason which America fired two missiles that destroyed the plane and many passengers were killed. Furthermore, some overstatements and behaviors of the US is another reason which Iran hates America. While Iran is \u201cfront-runner\u201d in the fight against terrorism, but America called Iran as an \u201caxis of evil\u201d which clearly was an overstatement. http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/201... Why does the US hate Iran? How do I get payment from the U.S to Iran? Who would win in a war between the U.S. And Iran? Why do we hate China? Why do we hate Russia? Finally, why do we hate the U.S.? Why do so many people in the U.S. hate the southern states? US and Iran were good friends, right up to when the US aided by MI6 staged a coup, killed the democratically elected Mossadegh and reinstalled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was an autocratic ruler who disregarded the law and constitution and exercised political oppression through his secret police, Savak, which eventually led the US to impose sanctions on the country and then led to the 1979 revolution:  Iranian Revolution - Wikipedia (Edit: fact check) The US has treated Iran unfairly in the recent psdt due to perceived communist sympathies in the cold war. Now the country is being run by religious fanatics and backed by their pseudo religious criminal goons with forces parallel to the Iranian military. Perhaps its a full employment scheme. American people and Iranians are not enemies but the forces of ultra conservative religious control on Iran will never allow mormal relations to undermine their power in Iran. This situation, couple with our alliance with equally ridiculous Sunni fanatics, trying to destroy the Shia has got us permanently on the Ayotollah\u2019s bad side. We are basically incompatible with their worldview as are they with ours. im Iranian and Iranians DO NOT HATE AMERICANS, Its all Politics",

Also if you reason behind revealing a dark secret is about making money then you need to questions your moral values. Are you doing this to set yourself free from the past or are you just exploiting the situation to suit your needs and not the needs of keeping or being in a relationship with someone who loves you.

        "a": "To understand this, we have to go back in time to before 1947, and understand the basis of the Pakistani state. In essence, it was the embodiment of the 2-nation theory; which was debunked right at the start itself when a good number of Muslims opted to stay back in India. The theory that Muslims are an entity unto themselves was subsequently put to a severe examination when the steady process of Indian Growth and societal as well as political stability was juxtaposed with the severe contradictions contained within that seemingly benign facade of an Islamic nation. The new nation, which was born without a history - the entire existence of Pakistan as a movement can truthfully be traced only to 1940, (1933 to some) - quickly set about \"finding\" a history for itself; with such attempts as potraying and tracing its history from Mahmud of Ghaznavi. One very influential figure is even on record stating that Pakistanis rode in on on horseback with the invading Turks. Everything the new state did to justify its existence established it as a Not India. This was further deepened as steadily and surely, Islamic elements within its society got a foothold, and grew from strength to strength - in complete opposition to Secular India. Yet again, \"Not India\" was reinforced. Everything it did, and still does - strives to find a raison-de-etre, a purpose and a national identity; and every step it takes leads it further away from India. Pakistan is, by definition, \"Not India\" The challenges came early on; with the pressure to Islamise the entire country and its institutions, and differentiate itself from \"Hindu\" (!!!!) India. The backdrop of the scenario- that Pakistan is essentially \"Not India\" - was added to by the partition massacre and the 1948 war. This was exacerbated with continuing tensions with India, which, added to its defining state - Not India - ensured a deep-seated insecurity and dislike. The intervening years, which saw the Islamisation of even its Education and Institutions especially under Zia, and the increasing stress on difference from India, took it further and further away from India. Any random thoughts of friendship that India may have had were quickly dispelled by terrorism and wars throughout our common history since 1947. If anything, this has only served to drive in a deep-seated dislike at best, and open hatred at worst for Pakistan, and everything that it has come to represent. The problem remains what it was: while India can logically and justifiably lay claim to a long history, Pakistan has none -  if it denies its Indian roots . Rather than accept this, it is striving to differentiate and create an imaginary history. The definition of Indian Nationhood is based on a centuries and millennia old concept of Bharat, and a cultural union; the idea of India in its \"Bharat\" version can be traced back centuries. Rather than accept this proud history, Pakistan - because of its inherent \"islamic state\" contradiction - is trying to align itself to West Asia and their culture. The result is that slowly but surely, the 2 common people are acquiring differences - be they real, or be they perceived. What matters is that they are present. The core of the issue is not Kashmir: never was, never will be. The core of the issue is one of identity, as is evident from innumerable examples. Kashmir is an outgrowth of this identity crisis, in an oblique sort of way. (Yes, there are other more powerful reasons). The demand for Kashmir started from its Muslim majority status - forgetting that the people were against Pakistan in 1947, as evidenced by support for Abdullah and his movement. Ditto for some other Muslim Majority regions, like NWFP. And with that, we come right back to square one: A Crisis Of Identity. And if you add to this the concoction of 4 wars, terrorism, hate stories etc - then, to my mind, there can be only one conclusion. India and Pakistan are like Harry Potter and Voldemorte - neither can die while the other lives. Unless Pakistani paranoia and insecurity as to its identity can be resolved, there is no solution. And now, it does not seem like a solution will happen, either. Furthermore, the sceptre of terrorism will ensure that this does not happen. As proof, a terrorist was once asked, whether he will stop fighting after realising Kashmir. Answer: No. The monster unleashed is now too big to control... As regards the people, with the rabidly Not-India approach, and attempts to redefine its history, the people are also steadily being driven apart. And please remember, the educated and erudite few who have risen above this are few in number as compared to the large majority... Answer: Never. What caused the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965? Would Iran side with Pakistan in case of an Indo-Pak war? What will be the outcome of the next Indo Pak war? Can you explain the main and real issues of Indo-Pak? What is Indo-Pak Kashmir issue? There have been 4 wars. All decisively won by India. Did it 'solve' the issue? No. So no, it most definitely will not.",

        "a": "As a native-English speaker, please yes. The majority of the the English-language songs are of especially poor lyrical quality, and all but a handful fail to go beyond regurgitating the same clich\u00e9s. Although one could argue quite rightfully that English-language pop music is guilty of this generally, Eurovision entries are consistenly in the  worst offenders  category. The language rule in use until 1998 needs to be brought back in some capacity. It would improve the overall quality of songs for starters in both a lyrical and musical sense, as well as bring more variety that the show desperately needs while also adding more cultural relevance with distinct cultural offerings. My personal idea for a solution: Perhaps there should be a rule where you are free to enter in a song in any language you wish, but only a maximum of 8\u201310 songs in any one language can qualify for the final, (Depending on the language entries of the \u201cbig 5\u201d) Once the semi-final qualifying spots in that language are filled (in practice only likely in English at present), the remaining qualifying spots are filled by the next best ranked entries in other languages. If this took the total no. of songs in the final below 26 then so be it. It would cause a gradual change if there was a consequence behind this. Do you think Eurovision Song Contest should recover the language diversity that formerly was one of its main features? What does diversity mean? In Eurovision it seems that only the Australian entry has any. Why is Israel included in Eurovision? What are some things studios can do to bring more diversity to movies? Why did Ukraine win Eurovision 2016? Surprisingly or not, a lot of people think that English is the most beautiful or the most popular language in Europe. Or the most important one. Non-native English speakers often think that their singers have no chance to win at the Eurosong with their native languages. They are not ashamed of the mother-tongue at all, but they probably think that they have more chance of winning if they choose the popular option. And they are partly right, because people have become somewhat obsessed with the English language. It is everywhere. I find this really sad because there is a great number of other languages in Europe which sound beautiful. All people should be proud of their native language. Croatia didn't want to give up their language (my mother tongue) for quite some time, but this year we had a song in English. I don't see that this has helped our singers. Our songs in Croatian had better results. But, there's another problem with the Eurosong. In my opinion, the Eurosong has too much connection with politics (the voting part). The countries join the invisible clan of their neighbours and expect the votes of their next-to countries. And there is usually a great surprise and outrage if their neighbours \u201clet them down\u201d. If your neighbours don't like your song at all, you are in big trouble. When I was younger, I used to get do disappointed when our contestant would get too few points. Now, I don't take the contest serious at all. It is fun to watch, but the voting system has many flaws. And now back to your question. I think that we shouldn't go back to the rule from the 70\u2019s because the countries should have the right to choose their singer or a band and the language.  But, more countries should choose their native language over English despite the fact that they can sing in English,  because they all have equal chances of winning if the song is really good and if the melody is catchy. Diversity is always a positive thing. And democracy is a problematic thing, don't you think? :) Unlike a majority I don\u2019t have a problem with English language in ESC. It\u2019s a song contest, not a language contest. languages shouldn\u2019t be a criteria.  English is the most used language in the world, it only makes sense that it is so in ESC too. So no, we shouldn\u2019t bring back the language rule. It should be as it is now, you choose language. I doubt Portugal\u2019s win will influence that much, some might try native language but English will prevail. I am even positive next year\u2019s winner will be in English. And let\u2019s look at what could happen if they indeed choose to go back to language rule? Then Sweden would lose it\u2019s status as ESC powerhouse, when was the last time Swedish language was sucessfull? Not to mention Finland who probably would end up dead last every year like they used to. Finnish isn\u2019t really a nice language to sing in. Russia wouldn\u2019t do to well either, have you heard Russian? Not to mention Ukraine or the other Soviet countries. Romance language countries would probably end up winning every year. Perfect singing languages. And UK and Ireland could go back to being powerhouse countries since they would be the only ones to use English. Would that be fair?",

        "a": "India is not jealous about CPEC because India knows it will be big burden for Pakistan as well as China in long term. We are concentrated here why this is not feasible Pakistan and this answer explained most of the things. If you examine successful ports like Dubai and Singapore, they owned by their own states and developed with long term strategies. But if you check CPEC deals they are negotiated with careless manners and Pakistani leadership has shown immense immaturity, short-sightedness, and lack of good judgement in signing off on CPEC. As time will tell, the CPEC will soon become Atlas\u2019s burden, a symbol for the world to see but for Pakistan to carry. China will get lot of benefits from it as they will have one sided deal as Pakistan don\u2019t have any choice as a broken economy. Here are some points. Note :  if you need references for these fact please refer my following answer and the sources mentioned in these link are only from Pakistan. Shyam Bhagat's answer to Is Pakistan becoming a Chinese colony? Huge Loan  - The CPEC is based on a  $46 Billion  loan (now it  $55 Billion ) that Pakistan has taken from China under Sovereign Guarantee. From the original allocation the $11-billion amount for infrastructure purposes is a Chinese loan whereas the $35-billion investment for the power sector. Infrastructure investments offered by China for CPEC is to be  paid back as equity (ROE) which is guaranteed at either 17% or 20%.   Check this example which shows actual malpractice in CPEC Projects. With a substantial portion of the Chinese investments focused on power projects, the viability of the projects has been closely examined, based on interest rates charged by the China Development Bank and the China EXIM Bank. Official documents have revealed that with an estimated  debt-equity ratio of 80%-20% , and these investments guaranteed a 17% to 20% rate of return in dollar terms on their equity (only the equity portion, and not the entire project cost). China will recover its investment in less than 26 months, and bleed Pakistan for the 25 year contract period. Not only that, such hugely expensive electricity will cripple their economy, making them a wheelchair case. If you check some historical facts,  Sri Lanka  is one of the Prime Example. Unable to repay its debts to China, Sri Lanka is handing over the power plant,  Hambantota  port and possibly the airport to Chinese control in a debt/equity swap. China would then achieve a major objective in its \u2018One Belt One Road\u2019 project, of having a strategic presence on Sri Lankan soil by professing to offer \u2018economic aid\u2019 with no strings attached. Thanks largely to such Chinese \u2018aid\u2019,  Sri Lanka now spends 90 per cent of all government revenues to service debts . In fact, the example of  Venezuela , a politically and financially high-risk country in which China has invested over $52 billion from 2008 up till 2014, the another biggest Chinese investment in any single country so far, may hold some of the answers. It created a win-win scenario for the Chinese government by marrying off low-wage Chinese labour to long-term infrastructure projects in exchange for secure and continuous supply of oil and commodities. All the Chinese loans to Venezuela were commodities-backed, under which  Venezuela was obliged to keep supplying to China millions of barrels of oil to feed the Chinese economic boom . As well as Pakistan has nearly (in 2017)  $72 Billion  debt all together which is nearly 70% of their GDP which are not part of CPEC and  Current Account Deficit is now raised to 120% . Even currently Pakistan has raised loans at 8.75% interest rate from I.M.F. by mortgaging Motor Ways, Air Ports, Radio & TV stations. To pay interest Pakistan is taking other loans to cover it and will reach alarming levels of Bankruptcy.  Major details about this  deal kept very secretive  as  Governor of State Bank of Pakistan Ashraf Mahmood Wathra , in December 2015, had said:  I don\u2019t know out of the $46 billion, how much is debt, how much is equity  and how much is in kind. Pakistan also has a history of fudging information and false propaganda. Recently, it was announced with much fanfare that the IMF and World bank had declared Mr Ishaq Dar as the best finance minister in the world. That was promptly rubbished by the two institutions. Again, Pakistan had  claimed GDP growth of 4.7%, after IMF corrections it was found to be closer to 3.1% .  With CPEC if you assume that the interest will be in the range of 7 % p.a, payable in 25 to 40 years, it would and mean China will have to be paid back approximately  7 to 8 billion dollars as EMI for next 43 years from 2018  onwards. Pakistan will never've in a position to pay back even the interest, forget the principal amount. One sided bids for Chinese Companies  - The contracts for investments in CPEC are all one sided,  no bid contracts against Chinese companies . There will be no Global Tenders and contracts are confined to Chinese companies with Pakistani sub contractors are the only ones who are getting the after meal leftovers that the Chinese would leave on their plates. There are also report that some of the projects are awarded to black listed companies in China, and substandard construction of Chinese Companies never sure the quality.  Khanpur  and  Nandipur hydroelectricity Power Plants  are prime examples. Preference for Chinese Workforce  - China is now having huge under-utilised capacity of industrial production and workforce. In CPEC  majority of workers, goods & materials are all Chinese . China is constructing quarters for their own work force in Pakistan. No assurances could be given that Pakistani labour would be recruited to work. So the money China is investing comes back to China and with interest. No Toll for Chinese  - Chinese trucks are exempted from paying toll tax. As Pakistan has very less to export to China, Pakistan will get very less profit from this arrangement. Under CPEC, Pakistan has to take care of maintenance and security of the road. The expenses Govt. of Pakistan has to bear from its own pocket. Pakistan plans to train 15,000 security personnel to protect Chinese workers on the corridor. Presently, 8,000 Pakistani security officials are deployed for the protection of over 8,100 Chinese workers in Pakistan. So Govt of Pakistan has to do without a single penny worth benefit getting out of it. CPEC is Plan B  - In practical, China\u2019s  major manufacturing is located in her east , bordering the South China Sea. It is crazy enough to imagine Chinese would like to  ship goods through an at heavy risk  CPEC, when they can  ship the same goods by sea for a fraction of the cost , the ports being next door and the sea lanes much better secured. The only province that can send freight down CPEC is the Xinjiang Province. The population of that province is at this moment attacking the native Han Chinese population and and want to secede from China. The Chinese PLA is fighting running battle in the province and has been doing that for many years. Therefore  Xinjiang has very less manufacturing goods to ship to anywhere make  CPEC very under utilized. In my view point that it is the alternate route like Plan B and it only works if Plan A fails. I think it is unlikely situation. So it strategically good for China but from view point of Pakistan i can\u2019t see any win win situation. Security Conditions for FDI  - Pakistan is facing lot of internal security problems because of internal instability and terrorism, thats why Foreign Direct Investment besides China is very low. Impact on Pakistan Industry  - China has an established track record of arriving much like a horde of locusts and completely wiping out the local indigenous industry. The floodgates to Pakistan have been opened to the Chinese and it is just a matter of time before  Cheap Chinese goods do the Walmart-effect on Pakistani industry and destroy what is left of it .  Because of  high taxation and high Electricity rates Industries in Pakistan cannot compete  with products of other countries. For example Cotton Industries in Pakistan which has major share in its exports are shutting down because they cannot compete with competing industries in China, India and Bangladesh which are providing concessions to decrease their production cost. Another big reason is China to whom Pakistan is providing favourable terms like  Free Trade and Low Tariff on products imported from China makes them cheaper  is the other major reason behind falling Industries in Pakistan. Also  Pakistan has much less to offer China for trade , on the flip side  Pakistani markets are flooded by Cheap Chinese goods  which may actually kill their traditional businesses. Lack of resources to payback loans  - Pakistani goods and services that they can offer to the world are not growing. This is well evident by their trade deficient where exports are much lower compared to their imports. Pakistan\u2019s exports  have fallen by 15.4% in the last three years  from $ 24.58 billion in 2012-13 to 20.8 billion in 2015-16 which is compared to $44.8 billion imports causing  $24 billion trade deficit  which is very huge as  215%  more than its exports. In recent years  Foreign Remittences are fell sharply  as decline of manpower because of weakened Oil Economy and ideological tussle with OPEC countries. These incomes are vital for Pakistan Economy but they are now on downside. As there is no major industrial growth, these loans are becoming major downsides for Pakistani people. Pakistan also fudging information about increase in  Foreign Exchange Reserve which is actually happened because of borrowing from loans  from foreign commercial banks. Total foreign exchange reserves are $22 billion that include $4.8 billion of the commercial banks as well. And out of these $4.8 billion, the government has borrowed $3.3 billion from the commercial banks, called as \u201cforward buying from the market\u201d to be returned to them.  In Pakistan only  1% of the population is registered in the Tax System , and the  Government collects just 9% countries wealth in taxes , which is lowest in the world. This is the major cause why Pakistan Government is highly depended on debt. As competing for military supremacy with with India, Pakistan is spending  7 to 8 billion dollars on its defence budget  which also hurts the economy. Due to the constant pressure of Pakistan Military institutions, the elected government are not intervening on this amount. So after  paying interests on loans and defence budget, there is very less amount left  for development work. Environmental Destruction  - Through CPEC  China is installing Coal Based Power Plants in Pakistan which has adverse effects  on human health, do major disregard for the environment and utter destruction of ecological systems. In one side China is trying to close their own coal based power plants and they are transferring same on the Pakistani sides. Though the Hydroelectricity is cheaper but it need lot of time to build. To solve Power Generation problem as fast as possible, Pakistan don\u2019t have any choice to accept Coal based plants which later becomes major problems for Pakistani Environment. Falling Education System  - Pakistan is  spending 2.68% of the GDP on Education , an embarrassingly low amount when compared to other countries in the region. The overall  literacy rate has gone down to 58%  which was estimated at 60% in 2012-13, shows falling Social and Living Standards as Pakistan stands at 160th in the world when it comes to literacy. Because of Islamic and Political Radicalisation in education during Jia Ul Haq military rule, the routes of quality education are shattered. The education administration is slack, corrupt and rather helpless against the student community. There are no proper checks on the functioning of the educational institutions and accountability is missing at all levels. The centuries old syllabus and foreign adopted material is another reason for degradation of whole system. Pakistani text books and syllabus still contain the old boring lessons that were adopted by text book boards a few decade back. Not acquirement of knowledge but easy questions papers and fake degrees are the aim of education for most Pakistani people. Enrolment at primary level is very low in Pakistan and most of the students, after passing primary classes, are dropped and adopt different low-grade jobs like electrician, plumber, motor mechanic etc. Currently in Pakistan there are  more than 25 million of children between the ages of 5 to 16  who are not in schools and  around 70% of children out-of-school have never been to a school.  As regards to schools\u2019 infrastructure,  40% public sector primary schools were operating without electricity, 28% did not have toilets, 25% were without boundary walls and 29% had no access to drinking water. While 7% schools did not have any building and 43% had unsatisfactory buildings.  Pakistan\u2019s  6% graduation rate  is very low in comparison with developed countries. Without proper skilled workforce you don\u2019t have the capacity to run and execute similar kind of project.  Nandipur Hydro Power Plant is one of the prime example where after lot of operational failures Pakistan handed over the operations to Chinese Company. Falling Social Conditions in Pakistan  : The indifference of Pakistan\u2019s government to health is reflected in the fact that  Pakistan spends a mere 0.9% of its GDP on health.  Only two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bangladesh, have a lower ratio of GDP to health spending. Because of the poor quality of government provided health services in Pakistan, Pakistan\u2019s citizens rely heavily on private healthcare, which they avail primarily through out-of-pocket payments. The infant mortality rate in Pakistan is 66 per 1,000 births which is one of highest in the world. Life expectancy in Pakistan is 66 years, as compared to 68 in India. More than  40 million people in Pakistan do not have access to a toilet  and nearly 52% of the population (94 million people) in the country has no access to improved sanitation facilities, forcing them to defecate in the open and these open defecation has significant health and nutritional consequences.  Around  7 million people in Pakistan are drug addicts , while 700 people die every day in the country due to drug-related complications. More than three million Pakistanis between the ages of 15 and 64 use heroin regularly and there are almost five million cannabis users addicted to smoking high-grade hashish called \u2018charas\u2019.  Unemployment in Pakistan is closer to 8.5% and 5.3 million people still unemployed . Theres are lot of problem for this conditions. In recent years Pakistan economy creates significantly lesser jobs than required as result of failing industries and services sector. According to economists eight out of 10 new businesses in Pakistan fail within the first 18 months due to various reasons. With these are the worst conditions, Pakistan has hardly very less space for Development. Internal Instability  - Pakistan has facing lot oppositions with its provinces like Baluchistan, Sindh, and KPK. Baluchistan has history of number of uprisings for its Freedom Movement as it is lacking major share in development and infrastructure. Sindh is the major economic powerhouse in Pakistan but it is getting less amount of resources from Federal Government which is dominated by Punjab Province. KPK and Gilgit Baltistan are also facing lack of infrastructure problems. The dominated nature of Punjab province kept all its provinces its envy and they never actually united as a nation which would make them powerful.  Failure of Kalabag Dam is a prime example of lack of unity in Pakistan\u2019s Provinces . The same thing is happening with CPEC, where every state is fighting for getting maximum benefit. Military Tussle with it\u2019s neighbours  - Pakistan is  spending more than 3% of GDP on it\u2019s military . Pakistan\u2019s military ambitions are mainly India centric and to match the defence capabilities it has spend more on its Military than its development works. It also has difference with Afghanistan as it supports extremest elements who are destabilising Afghanistan. And as a Sunni background and close relations with Saudi Arabia, Iran is also keeping distance from Pakistan on key relations. Only China has maintained good friendship but Power is always come with prosperous relations with neighbours. Without participation of neighbouring countries CPEC will never be successful as expected. Corruption  - This is the number one reason of Pakistan\u2019s Economic Backwardness. From  Military Establishments to small bodies in Government everywhere corruption  is massively involved in every development activities. The Pakistani Generals and their politician underlings who will squirrel away every dollar they could steal and invest it wisely in Dubai, UK, USA and Panama. They should not surprise anyone it is a kind of selloff like politicians did in Venezuela and Sri Lanka. No other choice to protect from India.  - Pakistan is having f ollowing the Security State Policy  and believe  India as their number one existential threat.  As India is becomes Economic Powerhouse, India is also increasing military capabilities. And in the military might, there is no comparison between India and Pakistan. Defence spendings in India is  $50 Billions in comparison to Pakistan\u2019s $8 Billion Military budget . To balance it Pakistan always take help from other powerful nations. Like they took help from United States till 2008 till they started tilting towards India. They have no choice other than to involve China though it will not benefit them in long term. China cares only about itself no matter who it hurts. It's the same with CPEC. China will take back its loan amount one way or another. It is very much possible that  Pakistan will end up giving control of the Gwadar Port to China . Their military's sovereignty is at risk. China has already put up its naval ship and military in Pakistan to safeguard its investment. Pakistan signed CPEC with good intentions but failed to get a fair deal. Success of CPEC is also lies in hands of Chinese people because Pakistan sold your prospects to them. So if  Chinese people think they push Pakistan in loss making business like Sri Lanka to gain full control , there is nothing Pakistan can do to stop them.  China also made similar offer CPEC like loan offer to India, but India\u2019s Politicians turned down  their offer by taking wise decision instead of trusting Chinese speculative intensions. With smarter decision India got similar investment on 1% interest from Japan which shows their diplomatic correctness. Pakistan cannot do anything as  Chinese state owned army is in Pakistan , that means Pakistan is already submitted to China. It is in favour of India as  Chinese Regime is neutralising Pakistan . Actions like arrest of Masood Azar and Chinese Navel presence in Gwadar are indications that Pakistan is obeying Chinese Orders. Only time will tell, whether CPEC will be a way for Pakistan to move towards the path of development or another burden to deal with and Like Sri Lanka, will Pakistan submitted to China, but looking conditions in Pakistan there is very little hope.

What kept Pakistan from developing at the same pace as India? Has India stopped crying over Pakistan CPEC? Why will the CPEC make Pakistan a good leader in South Asia in terms of economic development? Why is India so jealous of Pakistan CPEC's great success? First of all, let me clarify your doubt that India is not at all jealous about CPEC but India surely is concerned about CPEC. There are multiple theories, multiple opinions regarding this project. It has almost become a buzzword. Let me go through a little deep so you can understand what are the concerns and how the camaraderie between two neighboring countries can put India in a bizarre predicament. If you go through the picture you can clearly point it out that China is building an alternative route for transportation of goods (And many other things too!!). Now, think of the reality. China investing 46 Billion dollars for building up CPEC project which is 3000 KMs long! As far the China\u2019s reputation and policy go it doesn\u2019t commensurate with their present standing. They are seriously not in the mood of donating money to Pakistan to improve their standard of living! Now, let\u2019s delve a little deeper. Before proceeding further on this topic we should know about Strait of Hormuz. It is a  strait  between the  Persian Gulf  and the  Gulf of Oman . It provides the only sea passage from the  Persian Gulf  to the open ocean and is one of the world's most strategically important  choke points . About 20% of the world's  petroleum  (about 35% of the petroleum traded by sea) passes through the strait, making it a highly important strategic location for international trade. In this picture you can clearly see it is closer to Pakistan than India and way far from China. Currently majority of oil import of China is going through the following route: Now, if they can build a strategic partnership with Pakistan, they will get the grip of Strait of Hormuz which can a point of severe concern for India\u2019s naval security and economy. Now, if they can complete the project as per the project timeline 2025 then they will be able to import oil directly from Arab countries to East China where the major Chinese Industrial revolution is happening within a very short span of time. Currently, nearly 80 per cent of China\u2019s oil is transported by ship from the Strait of Malacca to Shanghai, a distance of more than 16,000 km, with the journey taking between two to three months. But once Gwadar becomes operational the distance will be reduced to approx. 3,000 km saving China almost 20 billion dollars yearly and Pakistan will get 5 billion dollars. Now the major concerns for India: Threat to Indian Occupied Kashmir as it crosses a certain part of it. So strategically, it will give China an edge and security would be a major concern for sure. China is State-of -Power country and they have the ability to Influence Pakistan\u2019s policy and it might unofficial become 24th province of China which again will be an issue For India\u2019s security. Strong hold of China in Strait of Hormuz which is making India obnoxious about the project as the history between China & India is not that sweet. China\u2019s Maritime presence in Gwadar port which can be detrimental to India\u2019s maritime and economic strategy as India also imports oil from the same region. Src:  China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Official Website Regarding Gwadar Port? Strait of Hormuz - Wikipedia CPEC to be completed before schedule: Chinese official Hope this answers your question. Checkout:  Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project - Wikipedia Thats just one project between 2 metro cities of India and some cities laying between them.  Development budget: $90 Billion I don't want to belittle CPEC potential \u201cfor Pakistan\u201d, but unfortunately I don't have any other way to answer. So calm down, we don't jealous. In fact we would want Pakistan to compete with India in economy so that you guys don't waste time thinking all crap and do some productive work. Long ago, as a kid, I went to a Bryan Adams Show. During the show Bryan screamed from the stage \u201cThis is the most happening crowd I have ever seen!\u201d I was quite young, I got so thrilled that for many years I truly believed that my city was the most happening one in the world. I even told this to many people from other cities. But most of them just smiled at my comment.  I thought they were \u201cjealous\u201d of my city,  as Bryan must have not said the same for their city. When I grew up and started attending such concerts more often, I realized almost every artist said the same thing in every city. And then I understood why people use to smile at my comment.  They were not Jealous, they were aware of the reality. Questions like this one, make Pakistan look just like me as a kid. With a $ 45Bn project some people in Pak are feeling on top of the world. And think that everyone is jealous of it. Some think that Pak will be a developed country and one of the most important country in 2\u20133 decades (yes people have claimed this). They have no idea about the cost of development projects and timelines. I won't spoil the party and will let people enjoy the 'feeling', till they mature to understand the reality. P.S. This answer is specific to the question. It's not an analysis of CPEC, as that is not in scope of the question. Hello, \u00a0This question is understandable if it\u2019s coming from a Pakistani.[Am unsure who asked this question though]. The reason being that Pakistan has ONLY 1 such project that it can try to boast of which also has been donated to it by China so as to curb India & to dump it\u2019s redundant technology in a failed state. Also, China is primarily looking to decrease its trade route distance by several thousand miles in bringing CPEC into Pakistan. One must not forget that China is slowly becoming the most polluted country & is looking to mint money by shifting its pollution bases away from it\u2019s soil. So, India should be least  jealous  of a country like Pakistan as there are far better competitors out there that India can look up to while competing. The reason what worries India is CPEC passing through PoK which is actually a  disputed territory  & Pakistan has given access to China without India\u2019s consent.[ How can you give something to someone which is actually not yours  ?] Hope this helps.",

There you will be able to figure out your eligibility too. Regarding CIBIL: Every Credit Lender = Loan or Credit Card, they will check the Credit Score ( CIBIL ). For that you wont have to do anything. You simply will be required to provide your PAN card at the time of application. And they will do the required check of CIBIL. If you have 850 approx Credit Score, you should stay assured of getting your card issued. Regarding Selection of Card: If you are looking forward to opt for a New Card, I will advise not to go with SBI. May be the APR would be good with them or offers may be great. But whenever an issue happens on a credit card in case of SBI, there wont be a satisfactory solution to that. Moreover you will get tired with your pursual for the resolution & at the end, you will give it in. Best banks for the card could be Citibank, HDFC, Standard Chartered, RBL, YES Bank, AXIS bank etc. Always remember, private players are more interested in their principal amount being taken care of faster than the interest in case of any settlement or any issues if comes up. SBI is not bothered for that. IN fact in case of a issue they wont provide you quicker resolution. How do I get a SBI credit card? How do I get cash from a credit card with no card? How can I get my info from my credit card? Is the SBI card a debit card or a credit card? Is it compulsory to have a job to get a credit card in SBI? Please consult the Personal Baning Officer of your present Bank, or of the Branch where your savings are traceable. A persistently growing saving Bank Account will be one positive factor in your favour. IF you have CIBIL report of recent months, that would be useful. A good track record of paying off your debt obligations places your credit rating high. State Bank of India doesn't issue credit cards. It's subsidiary SBICARD issues credit cards. So apply through Internet sbicard. Com or go to any SBI ATM and apply through services menu",

        "a": "First, let\u2019s talk about  auto insurance . Your rate is going to depend on a number of things. The average rate of auto insurance in NYC is a little under $3000 per year. Your rate may be higher because you\u2019re young and single (which sounds discriminatory but nonetheless are considered risk factors when it comes to auto insurance). So let\u2019s assume you get a rate of  $3000 a year . Source:  https://www.valuepenguin.com/bes... Maintenance  will vary depending on a variety of factors. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re able to get a car with about 100k miles on the odometer. And let\u2019s assume you drive about 12k miles a year. Your average maintenance cost will be about  $2000 a year . Source:  https://www.yourmechanic.com/art... Fuel  costs will also vary. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re able to pick up a fairly economical car and you\u2019re not aggressive with the throttle. Within NYC, a figure to aim for would be 25 miles per gallon. At 12k miles, that means you\u2019ll consume 480 gallons of fuel. Current average for fuel in NYC is $2.57 which means you\u2019ll spend about  $1200 a year  on fuel. Source:  https://www.gasbuddy.com/ Add that all up and you get  $6200 per year . That\u2019s about 35% of your income. Think it over. By the way, you\u2019ll also need to factor in miscellaneous costs for parking, tolls, tickets, car washes, etc. What is it like to own a car in New York City? Is it really worth it living in New York City? Visiting and Travel in New York City: What are good tips for hailing a taxi in Manhattan? Why does New York City get away with being so disgusting and smelly? What is the best way to get from Albany to New York City via car? Praise to you for your concern about your mother. Few sons would be so caring. You are a good person. You also seem to have developed very good work and saving skills, which is something many people never learn. THE BAD: But unless you\u2019re fabulously rich and own your own house/condo with garage, NO! is the answer to buying a car. Insurance is astronomical. You\u2019ll be parking on the street. If you use the car you\u2019ll be subject to main small dents, dings, and larger damage. Finding a free parking space in a residential area is next to impossible most nights after 8:00. If you live in, say, Rego Park, it\u2019s POSSIBLE to find a parking place if you start looking at 6:00. Sunnyside, where my daughter lives, fuhgettaboutit. (Forget about it.) You have to move your car for alternate side of the street parking. Fines are high. It\u2019s not hard to get your car towed, and this costs around $500 to get it back. There are many forms of public transportation in NYC, most of which is subsidized by the government. Traffic jams are common on surface streets and highways. If you want to occasionally go for a ride outside the transit loop, rent a car. The fees seem astronomical until you add up what you\u2019d pay for a car, insurance, maintenance, and let\u2019s throw in a few parking tickets, since it\u2019s a rare occasion not to have ANY (say $500 a year). THE OKAY (FOR THE YEARS YOU\u2019RE IN COLLEGE) When my daughter was in college and just after, there were some days she really needed a car (when she moved, for example). She rented a zipcar, and they are available everywhere in Queens. Now she uses one of the car services, which you also might think about (either Uber or Lyft). You don\u2019t get to drive the car, but the few times I\u2019ve been in one the ride has been comfortable, on time, low wait, and the last car was extremely comfortable. So if you\u2019re at Net Zero or the Target at Queens Mall, and have too much to carry, this is also an option. You ARE eligible for zipcars (they allow membership at 18 if you are in college\u2014so it will be when you get your student ID). I\u2019m not sure what the age limit is for rental cars, but if you\u2019re not going to drive far (up to 140 miles a day) you can probably afford to rent one on occasion. After that, you have to pay 45 cents per mile. That\u2019s a lot. Here\u2019s info from their page. Wait until you make a little more money, and are over 25 (that\u2019s when insurance rates drop).  Or, if you get a job that pays well enough, when you\u2019re through with school. Don\u2019t postpone a master\u2019s degree for a car. You can always rent a car or a zip car for a day, and take your mother on errands and just drive around for enjoyment. Think Honda or Toyota\u2014they are the most reliable cars in the US, when you do get one. My daughter works in Jamaica (shudder) (yesterday when she got on the 7 train to work, there were newspapers on the floor because someone got stabbed), lives in Sunnyside, and goes to school at night at CUNY law. and her boyfriend lives in Brooklyn. Neither of them has a car. I hope the zipcar or car service works out so that you and your mother can enjoy a car on your own schedule. In very rare circumstances, it is. My sister has a newborn. My mother takes care of the baby most of the time. My sister got the car for ease and comfort. She leaves early in the morning and comes back later at night. She always find parking spots with her schedule. We live in the Belt Pkwy area in Brooklyn. She pays around $100 per month for insurance and gas combined. A monthly metro card is more expensive. I, on the other hand, would not get a car. I live with her. I have access to the city by trains and buses. But I don't have a kid to make things harder. It's just me. I don't leave the house before most people woke up. I don't need to have parking issues. It depends on your situation. Consider both, check out the pros and cons of each. For the most part, I think that the majority of people in NYC are not in need of a car. New York City life differs from life in almost any other part of the country in that you don't need a car to get around. Public transportation and walking should do the job. The cost of maintaining/parking/insuring a car in the city is much higher than taking public transportation. Car sharing services like Zipcar might be ideal for your short-trip needs, but they will not rent to anyone under 21 or sometimes 25. Uber/taxis may be your best bet until then.",

Python has everything, readability, no parentheses, interpretd, type inference, duck typing, object oriented, functional, modular, extensible everything that\u2019s possible. Moreover, Google has invested a lot. I have been using python from those days it was in version 2.5, and 3 was not a dream. When input() could do CE. So, I\u2019ve watched it grown. Speed isn\u2019t a critical factor for python. Python is used for the logic and the performance critical parts are written Natively, having the advantages of both worlds. One can easily extend Python with numerous libraries etc. You can write a shared object in C and then use it from Python. It\u2019s that easy. It becomes platform dependent, but speed? Native speed..!! How much C/C++ is enough? Should I move to Java or Python or learn more C/C++? JVM uses C code to convert Java code into machine language?

C# and Java are different tracks. I need a common intro language for e... Where could I learn, Java, Python, or C++?

Donald Trump is the most current and had zero experience in the political arena before being elected. Two others I can think of that did not serve in office before being elected were  U.S. Grant  and  Dwight Eisenhower. Grant was the successful commander of the Union armies in the American Civil War. He was elected president four years after accepting Lee\u2019s surrender at Appomattox. Grant was a notorious hard drinker and the only thing he was ever really successful at was commanding soldiers, having failed in business between his stints in the army. He is generally not considered to have been a good president and is known primarily for appointing cronies and helming an administration that was beset by corruption and scandal. Eisenhower was the Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in WWII, the military governor of Germany after the war, then president of Columbia University, and the Supreme Commander of NATO before being elected U.S. President. He was popular while in office. Others with limited political experience who come to mind:  Grover Cleveland ,  Woodrow Wilson  and  George W. Bush. Of them all, I would say that Trump hands down is the least experienced. His lack of political acumen, combined with his brash, self-centered personality and autocratic way of going about his business is causing quite a bit of friction in the nation\u2019s capital. Grant and Eisenhower had some experience with politicians and dealing with bureaucracy prior to heading to Washington, D.C. What might happen now that President-elect Donald Trump has won the election? What will be the impact? Can I go into Architecture and still become a politician or the president of a country? What are the pros and cons of Hillary Clinton being the next President? What is the worst thing that could happen if Donald Trump becomes President? How can a politician become rich? No apparently not. Trump is a president now and my guess is that he became a politician by proxy because he ran for office. But, most importantly it appeared he never ran for school board, city council, state assmebly. He has lots of money so he figures he could be a President. What's sad is that the electro votes that put him into office isn't helping him make decisions for the country. And, the majority of the people that didn't vote mostly will not support him because they are insulted by his political views. No, at least in India there is no such kind of rule.

This works terribly bad for most women, because odds are, if she has sex with another man a divorce is just around the corner. As a general rule such ideas should be voiced BEFORE marriage. Open relationships are more common these days than you might think. If the husband comes with an open relationship plan 10 years into the marriage it most often is not well received by his wife.

A lot of my friends have a girlfriend, In the college, In Pune and some of them, Outside Pune! Now lets come to stalking. I Don\u2019t know whats your definition of this word, But We AFMCites are very clear about it. Crystal clear after HoD Of Forensic Department taught us Sec 354D of IPC. I hardly know any of my friends who wastes his time online in stalking. People here are rather busy running marathons or going to the gym. We also somewhere fear fake approaches, which, in your language, Might cause \u201c Immune complex deposition\u201d The Bottom line being: Just like decent humans from anywhere across the earth, boys here are also humans who believe in  Genuine relationships. B ut obviously, After having reached this level of class and maturity in life, They won\u2019 waste time in unproductive  Stalking. What are the best ways to attract Indian girls? What makes a man attractive to women? Are girls attracted to fat guys? What types of boys does every girl like? How can a girl attract a boy towards her?

Can\u2019t we limit the discussion to the college and stop asking questions of personal lives of AFMCites? It hardly matters. AFMC boys before admission have to sign an agreement stating ' we will suppress all our emotions and feelings '! We undergo harsh training similar to Root training of Danzo in Naruto.We are conditioned to remove all our emotions and desires. We don't feel any attraction towards girls. The non-sarcastic answer is that we are just like other boys.We do feel attraction and it can lead to other things which u have asked.",

There was a very good film made based on the book, with the same title.  All the President's Men (film) . The  Washington Post  has made extensive resources from its coverage available here:  The Post Investigates Another excellent book is  Watergate: The Corruption and Fall of Richard Nixon  (1994) by Fred Emery, written to accompany the  documentary series  he made for the BBC for the 20th anniversary. Here are some others:  Good Books About Bad Presidents There is a vast amount of information available on the internet about the Watergate scandal that led up to Nixon\u2019s resignation. Here are a few:  Watergate scandal  (Encyclopedia Britannica);  Watergate scandal - Wikipedia;   Impeachment process against Richard Nixon;   Watergate Chronology ;  Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities ;  TIME Covers Watergate ;  Nixon & Watergate ;  The scandal that toppled a president What was so bad about Watergate? What was the worst scandal in US history? What are the biggest scandals in Olympic history? How did the Watergate scandal shape the 1970s? What is the Volkswagen Emissions Scandal (Sept. 2015)? I can recommend several books on the Watergate scandal. The best book I have read about it is  Watergate: The Corruption and Fall of Richard Nixon  by Fred Emery published in 1994, the book tie-in to the BBC documentary series 20 years after Nixon\u2019s resignation. All the President\u2019s Men  by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, as well as its sequel  The Final Days  are compelling first-hand accounts by the two investigative journalists who doggedly pursued in reporting the developing scandal for  The Washington Post. If you like conspiracy theories then I would recommend  Secret War: Watergate, Deepthroat and the CIA  by Jim Hougan (1984). While I take a narrow view against conspiracy theories, this is worth a look as it calls into question the orthodox narrative of the scandal. Fred Emery himself used this as a source for his book. Hougan admitted nevertheless that some aspects of his investigations were dead-ends.",

        "a": "I once fit that description, back in the 1990\u2019s. At the time my reasons were: I didn\u2019t really know much about libertarianism. At a casual glance they seemed to be more about pot smoking than anything else. Conservationism, on the other hand, was entirely respectable. An optimism that the world would be a much better place, if only we got  our  guys elected. I looked at the world in a binary way, as conservatives versus liberals, not really understanding that the state itself was an agonist in the struggle as well, or that the state had its own malevolent tendencies, regardless of who was elected. Being too smart, but not smart enough, at the same time. This is probably a brain injury I suffered from attending Harvard. I fell into the delusion that getting the right smart people in the room is what was needed to solve any problems. Smart people put a man on the moon, so why can\u2019t they perfect the economy, end poverty, end all social strife and bring world peace? Like the old saying goes, if all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. If you are smart, and are surrounded by smart people, then technocracy looks like the solution to every problem. I learned the wrong lessons from the ending of the Cold War. It was thrilling, as a conservative, to watch the Berlin Wall come down and for democratic revolutions to spread across Easter Europe. Surely this was an affirmation of conservative principles. Reagan called for the Wall to come down. It did. Therefore everything Reagan and conservatives did was good. My views were filtered by media outlets like  National Review , which had, due to personal squabbles, purged its ranks of libertarian-leaning writers and expressed an antagonism toward libertarianism. Confusion over what conservatism actually was. I read my Edmund Burke and Russell Kirk, and agreed with much of what I read. But I did not see so clearly that what was being served up as conservatism had morphed into something else, neo-conservatism, which was just more Big Government spending and social control matched with interventionist foreign policy. I did not see at the time that conservatism barely existed in America any more. Of course, I\u2019m not suggesting every conservative makes errors like these. But that, in retrospect, is how my thinking was at the time. Can someone be libertarian, but not liberal or conservative? Can I be a libertarian and also a conservative? Why are you right-wing? If someone is fiscally conservative and socially liberal, what are they? Can someone be libertarian and an anarchist? I\u2019m neither, so hopefully I can give an unbiased answer. But the short form is that libertarian policies and conservative policies don\u2019t generally aim for the same outcomes, or come from the same reasons. Libertarianism (whether you\u2019re on the laissez-faire capitalist side or the libertarian socialist side) argues for maximal political and economic freedom, maximum freedom of choice and association, and minimal state authority and police power. Conservatism (social, economic, or both) argues that traditional social, political, cultural, or economic institutions should be supported and preserved. Not surprisingly, you can see where these philosophies are not going to play well with each other. A libertarian is likely to favor women\u2019s access to abortion and contraception so she can maximize her freedom of choice. A conservative argues against in order to retain traditional gender roles. A libertarian argues against government regulation except where any regulation is a necessary evil in order to prevent greater loss of freedom. A conservative argues against any government regulation that discourages the traditional order (even if freedom is curtailed) and in favor of regulation that supports the traditional order (even if freedom is curtailed) A libertarian is likely to argue against prohibitions of various sorts (on drugs, sex, music, or what have you) in favor of individual choice in what to consume. A conservative generally argues for prohibitions, both in the sense that \u201cnew\u201d potential vices will be treated as dangerously destabilizing, even while old vices are left alone (LSD and weed and meth, as contrasted to tobacco, guns, and alcohol) and that prohibitions are acceptable to reinforce traditional roles (gay sex and extramarital sex, as opposed to straight married sex.) A libertarian is likely to favor reduced militarism to minimize the requisite taxes and their negative effect on freedom for the taxpayer. A conservative is likely to favor increased militarism in order to smash even potential threats to the established order. There are only two significant reasons I can see for the current alignment of libertarians and conservatives in the US. Both have made common cause to oppose many categories of regulation - libertarians because of an opposition to regulation, conservatives because they oppose the  current  regulatory regime and want to go back to a historical one, which was also rather more modest than today\u2019s. Both have also made common cause against redistributionist taxation. Libertarians because the consider all but the most minimal taxation to support the most crucial needs of the state to be inappropriately burdensome, and conservatives because redistributionist taxation policies opposes the conservative position of the rich staying rich and the poor staying poor. Original question: Why would someone be a conservative but not a libertarian? Why would someone be a conservative but not a libertarian? Conservative in the American sense. When I was young and impressionable, I met a nice young Republican girl at a 1993 Fourth of July Party in Seattle for the local Republican Party who was quite surprised to find out how much we had in common based on my libertarian values. I told her a joke about Barbara Bush stumbling upon someone giving away \"Republican puppies\" in front of a grocery store. Barbara was so excited that she rushed to bring back George Bush, but by the time she got back, the sign read \"Libertarian puppies.\" Barbara asked, \"What happened to the Republican puppies!?\" \"Oh, . . . they opened their eyes.\" There's a tribalism among the conservatives I've encountered that is profoundly lacking among the libertarians I've met. That is to say, conservatives often pay lip service to libertarian values, but when push comes to shove, conservatives just don't trust the unwashed masses to think for themselves. They would much rather have a \"right thinking\" person in charge. All too often, conservatives are willing to form coalitions with supposedly like-minded people when individual action will serve them much better; as a lifelong libertarian, I have always been suspicious of people who purport to want the same things I want. The larger the group, the larger the inherent discord. I do not identify as (left) libertarian because I believe many libertarians inconsistently apply their values, often failing to analyse society as a system but rather viewing it as a set of separate moral challenges to be solved in isolation. There are libertarians who think they support the libertarian values of \u2018non-aggression\u2019 and \u2018free movement of people\u2019 when they oppose the restriction of \u2018illegal immigration\u2019. They claim that it is an act of aggression to prevent the free movement of Mexicans and such desiring to migrate to the USA. Technically this is true, but I think the illegals themselves  initiated the aggression. These same libertarians do not take into account that the USA is a welfare state with many public services: education, roads, hospitals, food assistance, housing assistance, cash assistance. The services were nominally intended to assist American Citizens who have in theory paid into the system but are down on their luck, such that they would eventually get back on their feet \u2014 in theory. Many illegals, by sanctioned and unsanctioned means are able to obtain the use of these public services while at the same time paying little or no taxes. Most illegal immigrants are net recipients in this way.  Therein lies the aggression illegal immigrants commit against the native USA population which libertarians often fail to acknowledge. Taking resources without agreement and without providing due compensation is called \u2018theft\u2019. It seems to me left libertarians fail to acknowledge the initiation of aggression when it is initiated by those with a place on \u2018victimhood hierarchy\u2019. This hypocrisy is why I can only identify mostly with right libertarian or conservatives. I think conservative values may be examined, like all values, but not by pseudo-intellectual non-arguments that foundationally rely on the unquestioned acceptance of futurism or Marxism.",

        "a": "Not necessarily. Political parties in America generally have a platform, which is in a sense a manifesto, but it is of little to no importance during an election. The two major parties, Democrats and Republicans, nominate candidates to run for an office, and the focus is placed on individuals and their policy, as opposed to the entire party, because in America, we do not elect parties, we elect individuals. I personally am not a huge fan of this system, as voters will often blindly support a candidate simply because they have been nominated by the party they support, but in reality, policy varies widely amongst members of a party. So to answer your question, yes, the political parties release platforms This is unfortunately the result of a system that does not allow for a multitude of parties to hold seats in the legislature, and instead results in two major parties- the Democrats, a catch all for any politician who leans left, and the Republicans, a catch all for any politician who leans right. The aforementioned phenomenon occurs due to a trend known as Duverger\u2019s law, which I discuss more here: Ben Burke's answer to Why is the U.S. dominated by two political parties? And below I have attached links to the Wikipedia article on Duverger\u2019s law, as well as the platforms for the Democratic and Republican parties. Duverger's law - Wikipedia http://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.... https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/... [1]-ben_1468872234.pdf How does a political party in US work and how is it created? Can I be a member of more than one political party in the US? Why have the two political parties of the US never been split up? How can I create a political party in the US for China? Is there an equivalent US political party to the UK's Labour Party? If so, what is it? There is, but not to the same extent. They are  party platforms , adopted and written during the National Convention in mid-summer of the election year, when the Presidential candidate is confirmed. Their influence has  seriously  waned since the 1900s and the last time I can recall them mattering was when Trump allies changed the GOP stance on Ukraine intervention. Before that? William Jennings Bryan in 1896. Very, very, very few people read them. Most people note \u201cthey exist\u201d; most of the time, they\u2019re rehashes of policy that the candidates themselves have put out for over a year. (Remember, candidates usually announce in spring-summer the year b efore  the election). Had Sen. Sanders won the 2016 nomination, the platform would have reflected his beliefs. 2016 Democratic Platform 2016 Republican Platform No, that\u2019s not how American politics works. American politics is based much more on the overall affective reputation of the parties and the candidates they put forward. And since congressional-presidential governance involves diffuse, counterbalanced power for either party, a practice consistent with a high probability of gaining an outright unchecked sovereign legislative majority is not really a good fit. 2016 was sort of the exception that actually proves this rule about the non-importance of platforms in US politics. Most of the time, in most campaigns, no one in politics or in the electorate knows or cares about the precise party platform, which is the closest American analogue to UK political manifestos. But in 2016 the Sanders campaign consisted of and further attracted extrapartisan activists, that is, lefties not affiliated with and thus unfamiliar with formal major party politics, who as a matter of their own sense of activist tactics and ideological commitments focused on shifting the formal Democratic Party platform towards their standards and version of more firmly leftish politics. With, I will give them the benefit of the doubt, probably a mostly sincere belief that the effort was worthwhile and a \u201cwin\u201d for their views. But 1) the party and the broader American institutional formal center left had already been moving away from post-Reaganomics and 2) the candidate is who matters, and who the candidate is and represents is a result of the interplay of partisan electoral factions, not of what gets written down as intents. People who don\u2019t even pay attention to politics in the US have senses of what the parties stand for based on their records, coalitions, and past politicos. And that\u2019s been sufficient. Typically the party will release a \u201cparty platform\u201d full of vague platitudes\u2026 https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/...

        "a": "The tourism industry in the Philippines is growing and improving - but I agree its much weaker than it should be. In  2015  there was a record  5.4 million visitors  to the  Philippines . Compare that with  Thailand  which had  29.9 million visitors  in the same period. Its rather vexing when you consider that you get so many of the same experiences in both Countries. The Philippines is arguably better when it comes to things like nature and beaches. Nonetheless I think there are a few barriers holding the industry back - Bad Reputation -  The Philippines has a reputation (I believe unfair and undeserved) of being quite an unsafe and dangerous destination to visit. Terrorism, crime and the ongoing problems in Mindanao reflect badly on it. In the end it comes down to public perception. Places like  Thailand  and  Bali  have suffered from terrorism, military coups, etc ..but they have a better \u2018public relations machine\u2019 and seem to do a better job of marketing themselves. Poor Infrastructure -  Yes there are good hotels. However, transportation infrastructure (airports, roads, mass transit, ports) lack serious investment - as anyone who has been through NAIA Terminal 1 will tell you. Infrastructure in the Cities and particularly in the provinces require major upgrades to make it easier for tourists to visit and get around. Not Well Publicized -  The  \u2018It\u2019s more Fun in the Philippines\u2019  marketing campaign was good but its not nearly enough. Ask your average middle income European or American what they know about the Philippines and the answer is probably not much. Its still a  niche destination  for backpackers and buccaneering, adventurous types. Lack of Exotic Culture and Intrigue -  This is maybe a little unfair - but I think for many Westerners places like Thailand are a little more exotic when it comes to culture, landmarks, cuisine, etc. Whereas the Philippines is very Westernized. Although I don\u2019t see this as a major barrier. The increasing visitor numbers are still encouraging. The growing number of Chinese tourists also has a lot of potential if geopolitical issues don\u2019t get in the way. But improving the tourism industry should be a priority - one only has to look at what its done for Thailand to see the tangible benefits it could bring to the Philippines. What do people think about Malaysia's tourism industry? Why is it not as booming as Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines? Why do Greeks think that tourism is a heavy industry? What are the major industries in the Philippines? What is the tourism industry? What are the advantages and disadvantages? What does OTP mean in the tourism industry? Two reasons. ONE: Let me describe the last time I had friends come over from the UK to visit me. They arrived at Manila International Airport (NAIA) at 1am. They were already on their guard keeping an eye on their luggage, having heard about the gun ammunition SCAM. NAIA is always voted as one of the worst airports in the world, with good reason. It's dirty, takes forever to get through immigration and was last upgraded decades ago. Once exiting the airport, they had to walk across that big road to get to me in the greeting area. They were harassed by countless taxi drivers (scammers, not licensed drivers) and beggars demanding money, and piles of litter everywhere because other people can't be bothered to find a trash can to put their fast food wrappers, and, indeed, half eaten food. Then, it was time to drive. Now, I have my own car in Manila, but, let's assume I do not have a car, meaning we'd have to have taken a taxi. The queue for taxis was soooooo long. I estimate that if we'd joined that queue we would have to have waited at least TWO HOURS to get a cab. So, into my car we climbed. It took us  90 MINUTES  just to reach the airport exit barrier because of traffic. Remember, they landed at 1am. By the time they cleared immigration, waited for their luggage and found me, it was well after 2am. Now, after that 90 minutes traffic, it's 3:30am. I have an apartment in Pasig which is exactly 13.5km from Terminal 1. It took us  TWO AND A HALF HOURS  to drive that distance. That's an average speed of  FIVE POINT FOUR KILOMETERS PER HOUR AT BETWEEN 3:30 & 6:00AM.  Yes, that's right, they landed at 1:00am and we got back to my place - 13.5km at 6am. Now, they were lucky because I drove them. Had they had to get a taxi as most foreigners do when arriving, there's a VERY HIGH CHANCE - ALMOST A CERTAINTY - that they'd have been ripped off by the taxi driver too. 'Oh, sir, Ma'am, traffic so bad, you must pay me meter plus 300 ha'. That was their first impressions of the Philippines. WELCOME TO THE PHILIPPINES. TWO: I've been visiting this country since 2010 and living here since 2012. I can honestly say that back in the UK, where I'm from, I have  NEVER  seen any advertising or promotion of the country at all. Once here, you see a HUGE amount of advertising on TV and in magazines by the Tourism Authority of the Philippines. They tell us how great it is here, and how it's  More Fun in the Philippines. What is the point in promoting the country to people who are already here?????? Before those things are fixed, you can expect people to continue taking their dollars, Pounds and Euros to Thailand. Images taken from Google Images. Excuse me. Have you ever been to the Philippines. There is always a fiesta, happening close by and these always include aspects of local culture. In ones I have been to recently these have included dance, marching, weaving, using shells for ornaments, storytelling. So if you visited all the 42,036 baragay for their fiesta that alone would take you a hundred and fifteen years. Add to that the major festivals of dance and culture that take place each year throughout the country see this  link . our local fiesta are not included so this is a list of the more widely known ones. Then you have hosts of museums, cultural centres and commemorations to historical events. I personally have visited over 200 different museums in my nearly 50 years of connection with the Philippines and that doesn\u2019t even scrape the surface of the historical knowledge and understanding that is available here. Have you visited the music festival, some exclusively dedicated to traditional filipino, or tribal music and others like \u201dFusion\u201d whose title tells all. If that is not enough visit universities and takl to their social anthropologists who will out you in touch with all the extensive and exciting cultural history you can handle. Or if that is to energetic, maybe visit a place like Apo island and dive in pristine protected waters, and experience the living culture of the Philippines. Then at night listen to the old people tell their history in song dance and story, to all who are interested I can easily tell you that it is NOT because of a lack natural beauty and diversity or the friendliness of its people. The Philippines archipelago is full of wonders and secrets to be discovered by visitors and, in general, Filipinos are wonderful hosts. However, as a traveler who came here long before deciding to take residence here, I can cite several things that turn travelers off about the Philippines. The poor states of the infrastructure and transportation is not a welcoming sight for most foreigners. The cleanliness of amenities and pollution, whether it is the air pollution, waters or noise, public CR or even watching Filipinos use their own streets as if it was their own garbage can, it\u2019s not appealing. Hell, even in a large malls, you will be hard pressed to fine simple garbage cans for people to dispose of their wrappers or garbage. The richest man in the Philippines Henry Sy, head of the SM empire which includes some of the largest shopping malls in the world, is quick to post signs on the importance of washing your hands in the SM mall\u2019s CR but he can NOT be bothered to have hand soap and when it does, it\u2019s heavily watered down to the point of being completely inefficient. He didn\u2019t ULTRA rich by magic! Travelers hear the stories of kidnappings, beheading, extortion, murders and now to add to the list, the international media is covering the ill-conceived plan of President Duterte to rid the country of drug trafficking by shooting first and asking questions later. So the perceived issue of travelers safety is a deterrent not to mention that rampant corruption in law enforcement is not helping either. Lastly, although Filipinos are among the friendliest people on the planet, peddling and the whole culture and acceptance of \u201cfixers\u201d, at the ports, airports, parking, etc. is not something travelers feel comfortable with and appreciate. Often it\u2019s those who are the most ready to offer their help who will screw you first. There is a general sense of chaos and \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d attitude toward making improvements, even in the little things. Corruption has taken a heavy toll on the Philippines and continues to do so. There are many things to fix before the Philippines start becoming a serious competitor as a tourist destination. It can\u2019t even rank in the Top 10 in South East Asia. Even Vietnam and S. Korea do better than the Philippines.",

But it is what it is, and if there was a way to eliminate the long obsolete and ever more harmful two party system, I would be for it. Europe's system of many parties running for office, forcing coalitions of different parties and more cooperation is a better one by far.

Why did Donald Trump choose Mike Pence to be his VP candidate? You mean if Trump is removed from office? No, Mike Pence would then be President no matter what, and if something happened to him, then Paul Ryan would be President. For the next one year and eight and one-half months the answer is NO.

        "a": "By no means. Carbon is still much more expensive, because it uses molds which are expensive to fabricate. Besides, aluminium is more reliable, light and strong, fit for most types of riding, and has a much better braking surface. The price of a set of good carbon wheels will in most cases buy you a technically superior set of aluminium wheels. There is only one persuasive argument to buy a carbon wheelset: you need the aerodynamic advantages of a high profile rim, but not the weight. But for a good quality wheelset, that will cost you. CyclingTips has a good write-up about the subject. What does a 700c bike wheel mean? Should I learn how to true my own road bike wheels? How does titanium compare to carbon for a road bike? Is it harder to pedal on small wheels rather than large wheels? What is the purpose of a clincher wheel on a road bike? The other answers are correct that aluminum wheels are still very popular. They occupy the low-to-mid range wheelsets for companies like Bontrager. Some comments on carbon wheels in general: Be VERY, VERY careful buying carbon wheels from places like Amazon. There are a ton of fake knockoff carbon Zipp and ENVE wheels on the market, and they are dangerous. Among other things, they might have used an unsuitable resin, which will cause the wheels to heat up and explode if you brake too hard. If you\u2019ve got the coin for a carbon wheelset, you might as well spend a little bit more and buy directly from the manufacturer. Don\u2019t train on carbon wheels. Deep-section carbon wheels are fast, but they are fragile and expensive. Train on easily-replaceable aluminum wheels, and save your carbon hoops for racing. Braking on carbon wheels is notoriously bad, especially in wet conditions. Don\u2019t buy them unless you have a lot of experience, and be very careful to give yourself a lot of lead time for stopping. Sidenote: Now that disc brakes are allowed in UCI races, you might want to buy a disc variant of your bike and wheels. That solves the braking problem. The short answer is NO. The longer answer is HELL NO. Carbon fiber composite (CFC) wheels are available and popular on Amazon because the Chinese manufacturers ahve developed such a gross level of over-production that they now have to get rid of them somehow, and the \u201cBig A\u201d is the answer. In the past 5 years I have developed 73 different bicycles for various clients. Wanna know how many of those have complete CFC or CFC-spoked wheels? Three. Since I do a pretty broad range of design work I think that it reflects a comfortable representation of bicycle (and wheelset) sales. So, that means just a hair over 4% of bikes and wheelsets with which I have been involved were carbon. Personally, I wouldn\u2019r ever rely on a CFC wheelset for everyday riding and as such would not purchase a set to replace aluminum. It  might  be a function of how much money you told Amazon that you were willing to spend on a wheelset. Bike Discounts & Deals from Nashbar Over at Nashbar online, they currently have 44 road bike wheelsets on offer. They range from 90$ for off brands like \u201cVuelta\u201d or \u201cSun Ringle\u201d, to 219$ for \u201cMavic\u201d or 419$ for a well known brand like Shimano. All in aluminium alloy. (Shimano specifies 6061 alloy.) It\u2019s not until you reach the 750$ price range that you find aluminium/carbon combo rims for a Shimano C50 CL wheelset. Prices head skyward from there; finally topping out at 1750$ for a Shimano Dura-Ace C75 all-carbon wheelset. No, there are plenty of aluminum wheels out there. Note that if you get carbon wheels, you'll need different brake pads for them.",

        "a": "Clinton won more votes and more states and the Democratic Party nomination\u2014  not disputed Real complaints were that the election process was unfair: Clinton had unfair advantage because media ignored Sanders.  Not true. BOTH Clinton and Sanders were ignored, as were all but one Republican candidate while the Trump circus was covered more than all other candidates combined. Clinton had unfair advantage because media covered her more than Sanders.  Ambiguous as to who got more advantage. Certainly true that Clinton got more coverage, but MOST of her coverage was negative as most of the media coverage was about her \u2018scandals\u2019. Clinton had unfair advantage in every closed primary because Sanders voters were new to voting and hadn\u2019t registered.  True but Duh! . That\u2019s kind of the point of a Democratic Party Primary \u2014 to choose the person who best represents the Democratic Party. Is it surprising that it preferred the choices be made by actual registered Democrats? The Sanders campaign were unable to anticipate and register their newly discovered voters. Clinton had unfair advantage because all the super-delegates favored her and let people know before they actually voted.  True, but again Duh! Superdelegates were created to ensure that the people who had most helped the Democratic Party had more influence than an average group of voters. Is there a reason why superdelegates, chosen because of their loyalty and support of the Democratic party were supposed to simply reject the person who had spent 30 years working for the Party in favor of the guy who had spent 30 years criticizing it and never joining? Clinton had unfair advantage because the DNC rigged things for her.  Not true. Despite probably millions of man-hours spent perusing illegally hacked emails that were leaked, there was only a single example of anything resembling the DNC publicly favoring Clinton. That example was Donna Brazile, a decades-long friend/aide of the Clinton family, while acting as DNC Chair, informed the Clinton campaign that \u2026 A question about the Flint MI water crisis would be asked DURING THE DEBATE HELD IN FLINT MICHIGAN. This was a stupid, stupid, wrong thing to do. But I find it hard to believe that ANYBODY considers this to have had a substantive impact. I feel pretty confident that the Clinton debate prep was aware of that issue and that it might be covered. While the emails DID display a significant internal bias and that the members of the DNC clearly preferred and expected Clinton as their nominee, I\u2019m actually quite impressed by the professionalism exhibited by not making that internal preference visible externally by any unfair action. Fundamentally, the complaints boil down to a supposed view that the Democratic Party Primary was designed to find the best alternative to the Republican nominee. This is wrong. BOTH Party Primaries are intended to nominate the person who best represents that party. NEITHER Trump nor Sanders were really considered members of the party they were trying to run for. BOTH tried to hijack the nominations of the major parties because they recognized that their best chance of being President lay in being a major party nominee. Trump succeeded at hijacking the Republican Primary process in defiance of the Party and most of its policies by catering to one particular segment, and the entire Republican Party fell in line behind him anyway. Sanders failed at getting nominated, but pushed the party and Clinton further towards his vision than he had dreamed of and was wildly successful at getting his message out. Then, despite Sanders himself clearly (if not enthusiastically) endorsing Clinton, a subset of his supporters spent their energies bitching about Clinton and how corrupt/unfair she was, feeding the Republican narrative that had spent 30 years smearing her with the same attacks. While I don\u2019t know the impact this had, I guarantee that it did not help her. U.S presidential primary candidate Bernie Sanders says \"It is profoundly wrong that the top 1% own more wealth than the bottom 95%\" Why is tha... Bernie Sanders seems like a genuine person. He doesn't come off as smarmy or smooth at all. Not the usual politician. Is he as real as he seem... What are some reasons to not vote for Bernie Sanders? I was called soulless and an idiot because I voted for Hillary when I was a former Bernie supporter. Do you agree with their characterization ... How many people have actually voted for Trump in the primaries? 10 ways the Democratic primary has been rigged from the start 1. Major Media Blackout When Sanders began his campaign, as he often recounts, he had virtually no national name recognition and trailed Clinton by 60 to 70 points in national polls. The major media barely breathed his name, even when he began drawing crowds of 20,000 or more to summer rallies. This was partly the result of the obsession with Trump, but also because the conglomerates controlling the media hardly wanted to promote such a fierce critic of Wall Street and the 1 percent. In December, the nightly news networks had allotted Trump 23 times more coverage than Sanders; on ABC alone 81 minutes to Trump for the year, compared to only 20 seconds for Sanders. While Sanders was holding extensive campaign events and press availabilities for months, Clinton was mostly avoiding public events and media avails, with the media largely ignoring its rebuff. (Even today, Clinton often passes on press conferences.) 2. They\u2019re Debating When? Ironically, unlike the Republican National Committee, the DNC manipulated its debate schedule to have the fewest number of debates at the worst times, intended to minimize voter viewing, including setting them on holiday weekends and the Saturday night before Christmas. The goal was to restrict voter exposure and side-by-side comparison with other candidates who offered a significant alternative to Clinton, which served to keep name recognition off Sanders and his prescription for change artificially low. Additional debates were only added much later after widespread condemnation of the DNC. 3. Sanders Booms, Media Works to Marginalize As the votes began coming in for Bernie, especially with his big win in New Hampshire, Clinton surrogates were given extra time as TV analysts to downplay the results, and the media narrative shifted. The media paradigm typically is crafted inside the Washington Beltway and New York boardrooms, with other reporters compelled by their own editors or self-censorship to follow along, a practice also known as pack journalism. A parade of big-name liberal columnists, editorial writers and TV analysts vilified Sanders\u2019 visionary program, especially Medicare-for-all and free college tuition, while promoting Clinton\u2019s \u201cpragmatic\u201d (lower your expectations) message that minimized the ongoing crisis felt by the millions left behind without health care, unemployed or stuck in low-paying jobs, facing mountains of student debt and all the other pervasive disparities Sanders described. The next storyline depicted Sanders as a narrow candidate because the majority of his support came from students, working-class white voters, independents, and low- to moderate-income voters, largely ignoring that Clinton\u2019s own base failed to include any of those groups who would be critical to winning a general election in November. Or that Clinton continues to fail to move support among those constituencies. 4. Vote Rigging After Sanders\u2019 sweeping win in New Hampshire, the DNC went into hyper drive to break his momentum, starting in the next voting state Nevada. Concerned Sanders would win Nevada, Sen. Harry Reid, the former Senate Majority Leader and most powerful elected official in Nevada, as it later emerged, arranged a plan with owners of Las Vegas casinos, where many caucuses were being held, and other employers, to ensure Clinton would win. The Nevada caucuses were then rigged with massive voting irregularities such as casino owners orchestrating which workers would be allowed to vote and, in clear intimidation, openly monitoring how they voted. Vote tampering also occurred in other states, most recently in Arizona where on election day, polling locations were sharply cut forcing many voters to stand in line for up to five hours in the heat, with some leaving before casting a vote. Voter suppression laws, rampant now across the country, disproportionately disenfranchise students and young voters, a group that has voted for Sanders by margins of up to 80 percent. The laws, passed by right-wing legislatures and governors, also target African Americans and Latinos, which will ultimately harm any Democratic nominee in November. 5. The Sexism Canard Desperate for attack lines against Sanders, the Clinton camp and her adherents have tried to paint him as a sexist, employing the same tactic of exaggerated small slights they used against Barack Obama in 2008 (remember \u201cyou\u2019re likeable enough\u201d). Add in the clumsy effort of Clinton surrogates Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright to criticize young women who vote for Sanders. Memo to Clinton and company: Bernie Sanders is not Donald Trump. He has a near perfect voting record on such issues as women\u2019s reproductive rights and pay equity, and most of his proposals, especially Medicare-for-all, free college tuition, and expanding Social Security would disproportionately help women. As the 90 percent female organization of nurses NNU has stated, we would love to break the glass ceiling, but this election is unprecedented in its opportunity to shatter the class ceiling. 6. Undemocratic Primaries Sanders has won the overwhelming majority of independent voters in \u201copen\u201d primaries or caucuses that allow them to vote. Many Clinton surrogates have fulminated that any independent voters are allowed to participate in the Democratic Party nominating process. As if only the two major parties should be allowed to decide who can run for office while a record 43 percent of U.S. voters are now independents in a corrupted system. Winning the independents\u2019 votes is decisive in general elections, suggesting they should have a voice in determining who are the strongest candidates. Because of the media blackout, many voters do not gain sufficient information about Sanders until shortly before election day. Early voting reflects lower name recognition for Sanders, benefiting Clinton and enabling her to win some close races. That contributes to the meme of her inevitability, but does not indicate she is the stronger candidate. In competitive states, Sanders has won a majority of those who voted on election day. When voters have more time to compare candidates based on sufficient information, they tend to choose Bernie. 7. Superdelegates Toe the Line Enormous pressure was brought to bear on the some 700 superdelegates, mostly Democratic elected officials and other high-profile DNC members, to fall in line behind Clinton, facing intimidation or promises well honed by a Clinton machine that has had 25 years of practice. An additional factor is the DNC decision to step up raking in cash from Wall Street and other corporate donors, and their implicit pledge to use those funds only for Democratic candidates who play ball by supporting Clinton. These officials believe that the way to win elections is through big donor fundraising and shapeshifting positions. The Sanders\u2019 campaign, supported by millions of small donors engaged in a movement mobilization, is foreign in their eyes and threatening to their donor base. The overwhelming tilt of superdelegates for Clinton has fueled the narrative that Sanders can\u2019t win, a line that the superdelegates, who have a wider audience as members of Congress and often as supposedly neutral TV analysts, parrot relentlessly, along with the other Clinton/DNC/major media attacks. The DNC created the undemocratic superdelegate system to confer the power on the Democratic Party hierarchy to handpick their preference and blunt the ability of insurgents to win the nomination after outsiders George McGovern and Jimmy Carter shocked the party establishment by winning nominations in the 1970s. 8. Who\u2019s Most Electable, Who Is Not It\u2019s repeated over and over by her superdelegates and the media\u2014Clinton is the most electable candidate, and Democrats must rally behind her to beat Trump. The line has been so drummed into the narrative that many voters in exit polls cite it as the reason they voted for Clinton. One problem: it\u2019s not true. Virtually every poll for months has shown Sanders faring better against Trump, Cruz and Kasich than Clinton, often by a wide margin, even as the media has already played out the attack lines Republicans would use against Sanders. Additionally, the media largely ignores the salient point that Clinton has nearly the highest unfavorable ratings of any leading Democrat to run for president. By contrast, Sanders, widely praised by voters as the most honest and trustworthy candidate most have ever seen, has among the lowest unfavorable ratings, despite the media shock that anyone would trust, much less vote for a Democratic socialist. The media consistently downplays a key Sanders point: how the enthusiasm he generates\u2014evident in the more than 800,000 people who have packed his campaign rallies\u2014that is largely absent from Clinton\u2019s campaign is critical for the nominee to win, as well as to help in down-ballot races for Democrats. 9. The Math, the Math The final defense for the Clinton camp and the major media, spinning out from the eastern media centers to local news outlets, is that Clinton is too far ahead in delegates so the race is over. To strengthen the case, Clinton\u2019s big margin among superdelegates is added to the total of delegates won in primaries and caucuses. Even though, unlike pledged delegates, superdelegates are not committed to their position. They can flip at will, as they did from Clinton to Obama in 2008. Next time you hear a pundit say Sanders needs to win 60 percent of the remaining delegates, \u201cand that just can\u2019t happen,\u201d consider his 80 percent margin in Idaho and Utah. In state after state, especially those that are not closed to independents, where Sanders has had time to campaign so voters get to know him, his platform, consistent record and unimpeachable character, and when the voting process is allowed to move forward without open rigging, Sanders does increasingly well. The result often is wins, as in Michigan and recent caucus states, or effective ties in votes and delegates, as in Iowa, Missouri and Illinois. Even in states where Clinton ultimately won because of voters who voted early by mail, Sanders increasingly won the majority of those who turn out on election day. 10. Forward to Victory Sanders himself says the path to his nomination is challenging, but still within range. States that were the biggest hurdle, in the South where the Clintons have a long history and Sanders was a complete unknown, are all past. The remaining states, including the two largest, California and New York, which have a base more favorable to Sanders, can be won with lots of delegates to be awarded. National polls have already shown substantial movement toward Sanders the past two months, and his edge over Clinton in head to head matchups with the remaining Republicans continues to grow. The challenge, of course, is not just to Clinton, but to the movement, including nurses and the activist army that has shattered all records in campaign contributions to Sanders and creates the overflow crowds at his rallies. Enthusiasm for the Sanders campaign, the transformative program he presents, which is the program NNU and grassroots activists have long championed, is off the charts and continuing to grow. It\u2019s on to California, and what promises to be an explosive convention in Philadelphia. The truth is that Hillary Clinton won the nomination because she received significantly more votes from Democratic primary voters than Bernie Sanders did, and she did this by winning commanding leads among the constituencies who make up the larger part of the Democratic primary electorate: African-Americans and older voters. The  Results of the Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016  were as follows: Popular Vote: Clinton:   16,914,722 (55.2%) Sanders: 13,206,428 (43.1%) Delegate Count Clinton: 2,842 (60.3%) Sanders: 1,865 (39.7%) States/Territories Won: Clinton: 34 (59.6%) Sanders: 23 (40.4%) Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million votes, as she would go on to do in the general election, though to a different result. Her proportion of the delegate count was higher than her proportion of the vote, which reflects the commitment of most of the \u201csuperdelegates\u201d to go with the person who won the most pledged delegates. Sanders made an extremely respectable showing in the primary race (his losing vote total almost matched that of the eventual Republican primary winner, and nearly doubled their runner-up Ted Cruz). However, Hillary Clinton beat him substantially among key segments of the Democratic primary electorate, in particular among African-Americans and registered Democrats (as opposed to independents, who made up about 25% of the primary electorate). They split the white vote roughly evenly. Sanders did very well among primary voters under 30 (roughly as well as Clinton did among African-Americans), but this was negated by Clinton's popularity with voters over 65, who had a higher turnout rate. These trends are \u201cintersectional\u201d as well: Sanders beat Clinton slightly among younger African-American voters, for example, but got slaughtered in the over-60 cohort. Turnout makes a difference here as well. Older black voters are particularly likely to vote in primary races, whereas among younger voters (of any race) the opposite is true. Somewhat surprisingly, income was not a very good predictor of which candidate someone would pick, roughly in line with the overall vote totals. Graphs taken from here:  How Hillary Clinton Won the Democratic Nomination Over Bernie Sanders ,  Huge split between older and younger blacks in the Democratic Primary The truth is that Clinton got about 3.6 million more votes than Sanders nationwide. I don\u2019t even think many Sanders supporters dispute the actual vote count, but more the underlying circumstances of the primary contests. I\u2019m not going to debate them in detail, but their major complaints were: Sanders\u2019 supporters main assertion was that the DNC told Sanders he would be welcome to run on equal footing, but then did things behind the scenes to make it harder for him to mount his challenge. The role of pledged vs. unpledged delegates (also known as \u201csuperdelegates\u201d). Pledged delegates are the delegates awarded for winning the states; unpledged delegates (about 20% of the total delegates up for grabs) are important people within the Democratic party. Clinton had a large edge in unpledged delegates, and Sanders supporters thought it was unfair that so much of her support came from (basically) VIPs. ( Note that BOTH parties have unpledged/superdelegates, but the Republicans have a lot less, so it was much less of an issue. ) One of Sanders\u2019 last-ditch efforts was that if he got close enough, that he might go to the convention and appeal to the superdelegates to switch over to him. A viability argument \u2014 that Clinton rolled up a lead based on winning Southern states she wasn\u2019t likely to win in the general election. Sanders supporters felt those votes should carry some sort of discount since she would likely lose those states to the Republican nominee. There was also some frustration regarding open primaries (anyone can vote) vs. closed primaries (only people registered in the party can vote).

        "a": "Well, I'm old school. So I would have the patient dip her breast into a full bucket of water, causing water to spill out of the bucket. Then I would use a calibrated container to fill up the bucket again. The volume of the water added equals the volume of the breast. That would give you an exact volume. If you wanted to estimate the volume from CT scans at 5 mm intervals, you could think of the breast as a series of 5 mm thick pancakes. Then the total volume of the breast would approximately equal the area of the breast in each slice, summed over all slices, multiplied by 5 mm. For a slightly better approximation, you could use the Trapezoid Rule or higher-order numerical integration formulae to estimate the volume from the slice areas. Calculating the areas efficiently and automatically is another problem. I assume that there are pattern-recognition algorithms able to detect whether a point on the scan is breast or not. Each point in the scan can then be considered as a square cell in a matrix grid and would therefore have an area determined by the horizontal and veryical resolution. Summing the areas of the points that correspond to breast tissue would give the area of the slice. If you could identify the points that lie on the perimeter of the breast in each scan slice, you could use Green\u2019s Theorem to calculate the area via a contour integral. I don't know how to do that offhand, but I know that it can be done. Are 3D volume reconstructions from CT scans available in the software at most clinics? How much does a MRI or CT scan of a head cost? How does a CT scan work? Does it mean a group of x-rays? What is the use of a CT scan? Where is it used? Can a CT scan cause cancer? How much does a full-body CT scan cost? Maybe just count the voxels, ct scan data can be available as a 3d raster, so once you find a way to select these elements you can have a volume",

        "a": "Depends on the guy. Different guys are individuals, and different guys have different feelings. Insecure guys tend, by and large, to feel threatened, defensive, jealous, angry, frightened, or some combination of all the above. Secure guys who are invested in learning and understanding their partners tend to be interested, engaged, and inquisitive. How do new partners feel if you talk about your exes a lot? I can't stop thinking about my girlfriend's sexual past with her awful ex. How can I just forget about it? Should I talk to her about it? What is the best way to deal with a partner who feels insecure when I talk about a guy friend? I like a guy. We've been intimate and we talk daily. he keeps talking about others and leaving here. This makes me insecure. Should I leave hi... My girlfriend keeps on talking about other guys all the time. I feel jealous. What to do? Original question:  How do guys feel when their intimate partner talks about their sexual past? I take it at pretty much the same level as them telling me about other life experiences, such as family history and dynamics, schooling, work life, etc., that will inform me on what they've gone through, where their feelings are at in that regard, what their background is. The previous person(s) they had a relationship with will dictate to a fair degree what they bring into the current relationship. So if that other relationship had been affected, whether positively or negatively, around particular topics it is likely to affect their next relationship What they learned and experienced with their previous sexual partners will be part of who they've become. So with any luck, your current partner will have had good teachers and have collected some positive techniques, traits and attitudes around sex (and other interpersonal issues). That, of course, applies to you and your own experiences too and what your current partner gets to deal with as well. So when your partner talks about their sexual past, it's probably just relating some of their history and how they became who they are, even if not consciously thinking of it that way. Pay attention, learn what they liked and didn't and build on those experiences; make use of the good stuff, try to fix the bad. But there would be little reason to feel jealous or insecure when your partner brings up what they experienced before, they're probably just sharing some personal history. Take it as a learning experience you two can grow from, not a competition or challenge to your own worth. Note that they're with you and not that other person. So bottom line, it's simply sharing their own stories and letting you know how they got to where they are today. Unless they're being real asswipes and blatantly saying \u201cWell, my previous BF/GF was better than you when doing thing X\u201d and accusing you of failing to meet some standard. Then they probably shouldn't be your partner at all. Goddamnit! You didn't use protection? How the hell did you last eighteen months with that guy? You're so lousy. ;) Did he ask for  that  move? Boy, did you not give him an amazing time. :P Wait a minute. Four partners over six years and you never tried  this ? :/ You seriously needed a reboot, girl. I feel curious and get too inquisitive. After all, we've to be the better one, eh? :P Cheers! Before I give my answer, I will say first that an interrogation technique is not a good idea. The idea is to listen and to hear what they are saying, in their own words. You do not have a \u2018right\u2019 to know. I think most men are very interested in their partner\u2019s past. Is this someone I can introduce to my parents? Is this someone I can trust? What sort of person is this? Can I leave this person in my home on their own? Their past, is a clue to their personality. This doll was made in a factory. Sex doll | Wikiwand I feel excited when ever my wife speaks about her exbf and their sex adventures ranging from public parks(outdoor), in shower, in his home, in her bedroom.

        "a": "A big yes. Reasons : A cliche, mediocre revenge story nothing more than that. The weight of the whole movie is balanced only by VFX effects. Now, when I talk about VFX I'm not comparing it with Hollywood, I'm just of the opinion that if you remove VFX effects from the equation the movie stands below average. VFX isn't the only aspect of the movie to be considered for rating. Next coming to genre, it's been tagged under  fantasy movie . Now, in the whole movie considering both the part I didn't find one single fantasy element in it except for the big ship suddenly growing it's own wings and flying sky high. Now let's consider  Ega  movie by the same director, in that movie the main character a small house fly was beautifully designed and that is a piece of fantasy not this one in this movie. So the movie doesn't justify the genre under which it is being tagged. The next thing is the action sequences throughout the movie. People who are considering that action sequences are out of the world are the ones just awestruck by the VFX effects. When I see a stunt being performed I expect a tiny bit of realism, if the action sequences doesn't even satisfies that tiny bit what good is being done by the VFX, I think VFX has made action sequences more awkward than watchable, particularly when climax sequence. Let's consider a movie called  Mahadeera,  directed by the same director who has done Bahubali, in that movie the protagonist will single handedly deafeat 100 soldiers, I liked that. Characterisation was lacking and contradicting. Let's consider the character  Sivagami Devi  portrayed by Ramya Krishnan - in the first part th character was deemed to be the most self righteous person and she never pay heed to others advice and always take matters in to her own hands. But in the second part the character was dancing to whims of other characters especially when she gave the order to kill Bahubali thereby being self contradictory. The next character is  Balwal Devan  enacted by Rana, being the main antagonist, this character failed to create the impact which it should've. I hardly remember any one particular scene in which that particular was outstanding. I clarify here I'm not being a critic of acting of an individual but only the way in which the character was portrayed. Considering these many drawbacks in the movie, it being rated as 9.2/10 and 8/10 in IMDB is overwhelmingly overrated in my opinion. Am I the only one who thinks that Bahubali is highly overrated? How good is the movie Bahubali? Are you disappointed after watching the Bahubali 1 movie? What's Katappa's age in the movie Bahubali considering he is alive right from Bahubali grandpa's empire? Why is there so much hype for the movie Bahubali? Yes baahubali is definitely overrated franchise. Lead actor prabhaas gave 5 years for this film at the peak time of his career is overrated. SS rajamouli has spent almost 6 years on this project and it is overrated The mammoth vfx is overrated. Spending almost 250 crores is overrated spell bound performances by all the actors is overrated. The spectacular war scenes are overrated. The music and the bgm is overrated. Producers spending some much amount on a regional star at that time is overrated 2500 vfx shots is overrated. What not is overrated in baahubali. Everything is overrated and even the 1500+ cr worldwide and still counting is overrated. During the filming process rajamouli collaborated with  Amd  processor and created  VR  videos as a part of promotion. Promoted his film in all the  comic Con  across the country. Created novels in tie up with  Anand neelkantan. Created goodies. Created comics. Rajamouli just didn't direct baahubali movie, he created an entire baahubali world and it deserves every penny for the teams dedication,hardwork and Vision. I  loved  it. The way the character Amarendra Bahubali was written, it still grows on me. Well the war sequences are not physically possible, but the movie is not about a man named Bahubali. It\u2019s not about people, it\u2019s more about a saga or an epic. Mahabharata and Ramayana are not about physics. Neither is Bahubali. If you question how does Bhishma sleep on a pile of arrows, how does Rama lift a bow which weighs a ton with his left hand, and how did he build a bridge with rocks, well there is no answer. Well, Because it was not about the answer. Ramayana was recited by people who have witnessed Rama and they praise him in his strength with metaphors. Surpanaka getting her nose cut, if that was a metaphor, imagine what actually happened. Not only Hindu myth, even norse mythology talks about continents being carved out of a single man. The movie was never about people. :) Imagine Bahubali as a character in Ramayana and the movie makes so much sense.  The movie is about metaphors. That\u2019s the way I see it.  And that is the way the director intended the movie to be seen as. If it\u2019s rated 9.2 on IMDB, it\u2019s because a lot of people liked it. We can live in denial, we can yell that a lot of it is nonsense at the top of our lungs, but if someone likes it, he likes it, as simple as that :) Rajamouli is a veteran. Not one of the films he made failed at the box office. It\u2019s because he is capable of making a movie that appeases a large variety of audience. This movie was made on such a grand scale, but it was not an outright rejection. When you make a movie like  Batman v Superman , people just rejected it despite its budget and grandeur. What makes this movie special is that, while some of the action is over the top and there is melodrama, the movie is made  also  for a section of the audience who want to see it and Rajamouli gave it to th em. Its not about making a movie which is 100% accepted by 40% of the audience. Its about making a movie with 40 - 70% acceptance to 100% audience . That\u2019s the greatness of Rajamouli. There are moments in the movie where you are taken into the skies no matter who you are. Some moments will let you down, but you will feel that something very special was created from India. PS  : Feeling that something is overrated is a sign we feel that other\u2019s appreciation of something we don\u2019t appreciate, as stupid. Well, it depends upon the context and by which person this question is being asked. If a person is more used to watching Hollywood Movies then Bahubali may look overrated however for the average Indian Spectator it is definitely going to be a visual delight and for sure it won\u2019t appear overrated at all. The moment its trailer got released people just went bananas and in the first few hours the Views jumped to millions and this clearly shows the anticipation by the Indian Cinema goers. Just have a loo at this article  Bahubali 2 Sets A Record Before The Release  and you will be aghast as to how eagerly the people are looking for this movie to come in Theaters. So calling it Overrated is simply not the best thing to call for an epic Movie like \u201cBahubali\u201d Absolutely. It had a mediocre story, the graphics was passable, the action sequences were not path breaking, and the publicized budget of Rs. 250 crore was spread across both the movie. I believe the first movie had roughly around Rs. 120 crore as budget. But the media publicized the Rs. 250 crore before the movie released a lot and this gave it a lot of buzz and the much watch status, and hence it became like a cultural phenomenon. It was really over rated.  Rajamouli's Eega and Magadheera were way more impressive than Baahubali. They were path breaking in terms of action scenes. I am not saying they were graphically perfect. Both Eega and Magadheera had very small budgets in comparison to Baahubali. But the ideas that they portrayed in their action sequences were amazing. The fight between the villain and the fly where the fly manages to fire the gun or crash the car - now, how often do you come across an idea like that? It was epic. Similarly, when Magadheera fight 100 soldiers in the flashback - the way that was conceived and shot was unbelievably awesome. Baahubali, for most part lacked that kind of originality. But, by no means is Baahubali a bad movie. I felt it was one, when I first watched it. Then I watched it again and again, I realized that it was wonderfully shot, it wasn't dull or didn't make the audience bored, it had power packed performances. Ramya Krishnan's performance as Shivagami and Sathyaraj's performance as Kattappa particularly stands out. Ramya Krishnan had such energy in her potrayal that you would believe in your soul that Shivagami is a very powerful queen, who would stop at nothing in her pursuit to protect her loved ones. Sathyaraj, with his ability to portray both helplessness and ferocity back to back proved his capability as an actor.  Then there is the question about why Kattappa killed Baahubali. That was fantastic. No movie that I can remember has ever ended with such a cliffhanger.\u00a0 It always was, what happens next. But, when it comes to Baahubali 2, no one is wondering about how it is going to end (which we can all imagine) but why the hell did Kattappa killed Baahubali. Now, that is one hell of an achievement for the makers. People are waiting for the answer.",

How can I get to the Ujjaini Mahakali Temple from the railway station? How far is it from the station? What are some tourist places around it?... How will the weather in sikkim be in the end of June? Is it the right time to go? Which are the best places to visit Sikkim in June? What would be a good place to visit as an outing for a couple of days in 1st week of June around Gujarat? Flood never hit sikkim as we are located on the hills. I presume that you are worried about the landslides instead. Roads in sikkim never used to be good traditionally but from last two years, the situations have improved drastically since the major roads have been widened and minor mud slides here n there do not hamper traffic movements at all and even if it does, heavy excavation machinery are now available at all places to make sure to get the traffic moving within no time. Sikkim receives a lot of rainfall annually. When other places are reeling in heat , we are being relieved with rains and that's the whole reason why we get visited. Present population of Sikkim is approx 7 lacs and annual turnout of visitors approximately 15 lacs. I hope I have answered your query. Yes there are the chances.. but monsoon forecast of this year seems that it is unlikely to encounter with heavy rainfall in this season. So pack ur bags and plan the trip.

The investment is DEFINITELY less than $2,000 unless you want to use that money to outsource content (having freelancers to write articles for you). I've met people online (some of them are now my friends) who absolutely make money with their website (and more than $5,000/month). Recently I shared a post on GooglePlus about  Top 5 Successful Stories from Wealthy Affiliates , who make money online (as I said earlier, sometimes even more than $5,000). Actually, their websites are their full-time income now. Don\u2019t get me wrong though -  what they do is a PROCESS , they all started with nothing and it took them time, patience, proper guidance and hard work to build a profitable online business. Read their stories, they might inspire you. Since I personally rejected Law School to turn to online opportunities, I always advocate building an online business where  real opportunities  exist. But I realize it\u2019s not for everyone and not everyone has that kind of persistence and hard work to make it work online. For further clarification, I'd like to share an info-graphic below to learn about the BASIC process of making money online with a blog/website (most people tend to over-complicate it): (Image may be copyrighted, so don\u2019t use it for your blogs). An example from the article \u201c To Build Or To Not Build? How To Create A Website For Free, From Scratch \u201d   on how this works: \u201cFirst thing that you should understand is that there are 3.75 billion people online who always search stuff on the Internet and are ready to buy things. Before they enter the \u201cbuying\u201d phase, first, they need to find out what exactly is it that they want, where they can get it and why should they get it. Basically, they are doing thekir research and this is where your website comes in to HELP them make a decision. Let me give you an example. Let\u2019s say I want to search for \u201cwhat are the best blenders\u201d. I type this question in Google and what I see is your website, which provides a list of top 5 blenders that you recommend with the reasons why you recommend them. Within your list, you include your affiliate link (for example, from Amazon) and if I found your review helpful and made an informed decision, I may as well go ahead to Amazon and buy one of the blenders you recommended. This way everybody is happy. I am happy that I finally found a helpful review and bought a blender that I am going to use; Amazon is happy because they had a sale (thanks to you); you are happy because you got an Amazon commission for the product that I just bought. By the way, if I bought not just a blender but anything else within 24 hours after following your link, then you will get  even more  commissions. Win-win situation. The best part of having an online business is that you will  genuinely be helping people  by offering them proper information  and earning money  in the process. So, this is the very basic process of making money online.\u201d I hope this gives you a clear understanding of how affiliate marketing (promoting Amazon products to your visitors) with your own website works. Please understand that even though this way of making money takes time and is a PROCESS really, it is a legit and absolutely legal way to make money online. The article \u201cTo Build Or To Not Build? How To Create A Website For Free, From Scratch.\u201d touches on 4 topics that not all newbies online may have knowledge of: understanding how to make money online, why having a website is the foundation for a successful online business, how to create a website for free, from scratch in the easiest way possible (and have access to a 10-lesson course for free), and how and where to receive proper education and guidance if you TRULY want to succeed online. If this is something that interests you to learn about,  further details are here. Now earlier I mentioned the money part and this is because even though the investment might be minimal, you will need to invest (like domain name and other important stuff). Also, the process of building a website will be SUPER easy, but please note that building a successful online business DOES take your dedication, hard work, persistence and time. It\u2019s a PROCESS. Online success varies from one person to another, but I do know a few people who achieved success in the 3\u20136 months range. They worked their butts of to get to where they are now. In the beginning it may not be easy, but when you start having passive income from the work that you've done once, that\u2019s when your life will be shweeeet ;) I hope I could help and please do ask if you have any questions! I have 2000 dollars. How can I invest them or grow them? How do I make $1000 in one day? How do I grow my money from $2000 to $20000 within a year? I have $2000 saving, what is the best way to grow this saving? What is the best thing I can buy with 2000 Rs? It depends on whether you want to start your own business or wants to do investment on long term basis. Investment: Investment is simply putting money in something for making a profit in the future. There are so many examples of investment like real estate, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, forex,gold etc. Business: A business where you buy goods and services and sell it for make a profit as a result. You can do internet business, retail (buy&sell), trading, franchise business n lots of. Now its up to you to decide which one gives you best return on your location. Buying things and reselling them.  Depending on where you live, commodities such as beer can reach markups of about 200%. Geographical arbitrage also helps. If the amount grows after a certain level and marginal costs start creeping in, perhaps you would be better off trading in financial markets. It all depends on several factors which are beyond the scope of this question. hey i love your question my suggestion is join my company with only 99$ from that 2000$ and keep the rest for a rainy day we are a unique company we help people start or buy or brand there business an automated online way be it eCommerce or apps have you considered getting into that industry ? cnn and bloomberg recently stated on a statistical report its the best industry and highest paid industry of 2017 and onward everything is tech today so dont fall behind we have amazing products for sale to get you started or just build your own with an amazing drag and drop builder with over 400 templates ready made for you the best thing you could do with that money is invest it in yourself education is the key to success and failure only comes from not trying dont be fooled by the financial markets if that was a consideration i was a day trader working for the biggest firms in the world assisting in sales retention training its the biggest legal scam in the world trust me all they want is to take your money and make more for themselves and once you hit a bad drop they really dont give a shit because they allready made there pips if the markets is a thing you relly wanted to do i suggest trading yourself but once again educate yourself first we offer a full live world trade platform especially for that its only education so no you wont be making any money with us we just prepare you for the real world of trading the best thing for you is building your online/offline tech business today you can do 3 apps for 99$ 1 ios 1 android 1 amazon and with amazing support to guide you when you get stuck  www.billionaireinclimited,com where potential billionaires are made anything els i can help you with let me know kind regards Hamilton C Cheong ceo of billionaire inc limited",

        "a": "I don\u2019t condone this but I do understand it. It\u2019s done because the expensive car\u2019s owner is tired of paying the insurance deductible to have the car repaired every time some other driver carelessly lets their door swing open, \u201caccidentally\u201d putting a dent or scratch in the car. Consider - they had an asset valued at, say, $60,000.00 Then, someone came along and whacked it hard enough to dent it or at least scratch the paint deeply. The vehicle instantly lost, say, $5,000.00 in value due to this. At that point, to get the car back to its original condition will be EXPENSIVE. The insurance company\u2019s going to end up paying to have the dent removed, if possible, and the paint matched perfectly as it\u2019s repainted. And, the car\u2019s owner will have to pay whatever \u201cdeductible\u201d amount they agreed to when they got the car insured. So, given 3 choices: a) live with the fact that your expensive car has been dented - leave it dented b) be inconvenienced by not having the car for a few days, and pay the deductible to have the dent fixed c) park far enough away from other cars to PRECLUDE a) or b) from being the choices \u2026which one would you choose? Why do people back up into parking spaces? What are some clever ways to mess with people with expensive cars who consistently park in two parking spots? Why do some people take two parking spaces when parking their car? What are some parallel parking tips? My dad has a one car garage which doubles as a workshop. He needs more space as there is a car in it. What can he do? I don\u2019t know what your definition of \u201cexpensive\u201d is, but let\u2019s say something that the owner paid more than \u00a330,000 for, shall we? That car is likely to be wider than average. Cars are wider than they used to be, but spaces seem to be narrower. That car is likely to be newer and so any dents or scratches caused by careless people in the next space are going to be more noticeable. More expensive cars typically have more expensive paint, so damage will cost more to fix. Someone who spends more on a car is more likely to want their car to look good than someone who doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s not something I do (although I do look for spaces surrounded by free spaces), but I can see why people do it. Firstly lets see why people park like this. 1: You work you butt off to buy a new car(cost means nothing here), you park normally. You come back to find someone opened their door into your new car and it has a nice big dint in it because they care about them selves or they dont open the door when their kids get in cause kids will just open a car door and hit your car and they wont think nothing of it(as they are kids). 2: Some people are jealous and will damage the car even if it is parked correctly Look up \u201cUK keyed aston martin\u201d on google. He caused \u00a38,000 worth of damage. 3: And lets not forget cars have gotten wider while parking spaces have stayed the same or have shrunk to add more spaces to a carpark to make it seem better as it offers more spaces. Eg. A 6th gen Honda Civic hatchback was 67.1 in/1,704 mm wide A 9th gen Honda Civic hatchback which is current gen is 69.7in/1,770 mm That is 2.6in or 7 cm which may not seem that much but it all adds up, cars also have longer doors to make getting in easier, these longer doors stick out further. If the carpark has an attendant, tell them and maybe they will fine the driver. As for why cost means nothing, a car is easily the 2nd most expensive asset you will own, the house being the first. Do you want some careless idiot damaging something that you worked hard for? For starters, not all people with expensive cars do that. For seconders, douchebags that take 2 parking spaces will take those parking spaces regardless of their car.",

Another major defect lies in the implementation of policies, yeah the government may come up with various policies but these policies are not reaching to the grassroot level due to illegal practices like corruption and also a lack of communication between the government and the people.

This is the biggest nonsense that is a direct product of appeasement politics. There are incidents which are indeed black and white.

        "a": "Indian skin also comprises of various kinds of skin such as: Combination Skin; Oily Skin; Dry Skin; Normal Skin. It depends on your skin tone as to what SPF should you use. For instance, if you have a dry skin, then you must use a sunscreen which has a creamy base so that it can keep your skin hydrated and moisturised. Similarly, for those have oily skin, they must use a SPF which is oil free and is non creamy and non greasy. Here is my list of the best Sunscreen in India: 1.Lotus 2.Lakme 3.Loreal You can get the reviews of various Sunscreens available in India here: Beat The Heat with These Amazing Sunscreen Lotions! What are some best facewash in India that I can use to get a fairer skin? How do I improve my skin tone naturally? I have dark brown Indian skin. How do I use makeup to look fairer? I m 18 year old Indian girl, light skinned. How should I start taking care of my skin? What light makeup should I use? Which is the best cream for (daily use) oily skin for girls? I would prefer sunscreen of Spf-50 for Indian skin Sunscreen should be applied half hour before going outdoors Sunscreen should also be selected according to your skin type Sunscreen should be applied liberally in all parts of your body which are exposed to sun ex. Ears, hands, legs because many have wrong concept of applying only on their face If you are planning to do makeup apply sunscreen prior to makeup and allow it enter your skin. Facial skin being thinner compared to the entire body, which has different quality and texture. This is a major factor which should be considered before purchasing a SPF or UV sun ray protective lotion. Applying a SPF which is not compatible with your skin type can often lead to breakout and sun damage on your skin instead of shielding it. The SPF on the lotion can be selected based on the heat and humidity in the environment. Indian skin can be determined as oily skin who should use water or gel based, normal skin should use lotion based and dry skin who should use thick SPF with moisturizing base. I live in Delhi where you can expect the temperature to rise above 45 degree, and sunscreen consisting of more than 30 SPF is appropriate for me. More SPF equals to less tanning effects. So you can select any lotion between 25 to 70 SPF ratios to protect your skin against any sun damage. VLCC Maximum Sun Screen Lotion SPF 70 is one of my favourite sunscreen that offers maximum protection against the sun. You can also try VLCC Skin Nourishing Sun Screen Lotion - SPF 40 PA+ which is suitable for dry skin types.",

        "a": "It is often the case that when a person falls in love head over heels, they forget about things like self-respect or personal boundaries. So they allow a person they \u201clove\u201d to treat them in a complete inappropriate way. This behavior is usually linked to lack of self-love and emotional dependence on someone. The problem is that the longer a person allows another one to treat him/her like $hit, the harder is to stop this relationship. We tend to overvalue things in which we invested loads of time and emotions. If a girl ignores a guy, will it make him chase her? When will girls begin to notice the nice guys? What does it mean when a girl plays with her hair while talking to a guy? Do girls get bored by nice guys? Why do nice guys get friend-zoned? Growing up, I'd always assumed that I would end up married to an abusive man, that after marriage everything would go downhill, because I thought that was a much more realistic fate than finding a knight in shining armor, sprinkling a little fairly dust, and POOF, happily ever after. So, I fell for just about every asshole who came my way. I thought that they might just be assholes because they'd never experienced love, so maybe I could change them if I could just love them with all I've got\u2014And if i couldn't change them, oh well, it's my fate to marry a jerk anyway. I figured that a perfect guy should have his own perfect girl, and I knew that I've never been perfect so of course I would have to settle for a jerk. Then, one day, I met someone who seemed like a funny jerk, an ass who knew how to be adventurous and have fun. He intrigued me and I needed a bit of excitement in my life, so I got to know him better. We've been together now for over a year, and as it turns out, he's not an asshole at all\u2014in fact, he's the sweetest, most loving man I've ever met and I wouldn't trade him for the world. He isn't who I thought he was, and I thank my lucky stars for that, because now I see that it's not my fate to have to settle for the most rotten apple at the bottom of the barrel. I thought that I didn't deserve anything more than a heartless jerk. I thought I was going to live the rest of my life with someone who would never love me, never treat me as a human being, and I was okay with that because I didn't think I could ever deserve more than that. Now, I can't speak for other girls. I don't know exactly why they choose to love an ass and turn a blind eye to the nice guy. But I can tell you that I did it because I thought I wasn't worthy of a nice guy, and I was afraid that I would cheat the nice guys I knew out of finding the perfect girls for them. Also, bad boy personas are kinda hot, so there's that :D Nice guys find it difficult to express themselves sometimes and girls want those who can actually show them what they feel about them. So girls end up believing those fake gestures and promises made by assholes and then regret meeting them whereas the nice guys still don\u2019t know how to express their love for them Define asshole and a perfect guy first. Firstly,love is an emotion that can be aroused for anyone. It doesn't takes your permission before falling for a person, does it? And loving a person is the most beautiful thing one can do. Coming back to your question, this kinda situation can occur with anyone. Even boys can end up falling for wrong girls. You are just generalising shit maybe because you have encountered the situations like above more in your life or probably you yourself were a part of it. you just think about yourself and not other stud guys. You play the role of a good and set example for others. All the luck to you! Short answer. A father is supposed to model the type of person or behavior that he wishes and hopes his daughters will look for in their own future partners. If that model or template is that of an asshole, its difficult for the daughter to see passed it, because its is the long established template for what a man is supposed to be. Thats why women, and men, habitually keep dating the same types of people. A string if assholes instead of looking for a keeper.",

Real Estate & infrastructure is showing negative growth.

IT & BPO sectors have also seen layoffs eg; Cognizant, TCS, Wipro etc. Ask your friends the kind of yearly appraisals given to them. Auto sector is down. Major companies like GM are looking for an exit route from India. They have already made the announcements of layoffs & their exit from India. Banking sector is doing poorly. Most banks have a complete freeze on recruitments. Even the insurance sector is bleeding. Try searching for branch offices of insurance companies near your place & you will know the situation. Look out for companies like 'New york life, Standard life, ING etc and check if they still have business interests in India. Aviation sector is again badly affected.

        "a": "It is important you get along with your coworkers and it is possible to build positive, professional relationships with almost everyone. Why is it important? I can not think of a job in which you don\u2019t need to interact effectively with others to achieve organizational/career goals. Even the fire spotter working alone in the woods depends upon the people who take calls and respond to possible fires. Whether you are starting to work with a new team or find yourself in a 5-year standoff with you arch nemesis, there are steps you can take to make a challenging working relationship positive and productive. Start by trying to understand the other person\u2019s point of view; do they feel threatened by you? Do you remind them of someone who was abusive? How do you find out? Ask. Something like, \u201cIt seems that whatever I do or say upsets you; I really don\u2019t want that to be the case. Could you share why I evoke that reaction?\u201d Then stop and listen; no matter what the person says do not be offended or reactive. Listen actively and when they are done repeat what you think they said; do not tell them they are wrong to feel that way; recognize/honor their feelings and thank them for sharing. Sometimes that is all it takes for someone to realize their treatment of you has nothing to do with you and the way the act towards you will change. If their comments are about a behavior you have control over, after listening, say \u201cThank you, you have given me a lot to think about.\u201d Then in a quite place, where you have time to think, ponder what you can do to change the relationship. Remember; the only person you have control over is yourself. If you are not able to change the nature of a relationship from hostile to professional on your own you can ask if there is someone in the organization trained to mediate this type of situation. The fact that you take the initiative to turn a negative into positive relationship is a career building accomplishment whether or not you are successful. Good luck. How do I get along with colleagues? How can I get along with a colleague whom I dislike? How do I get along with others? I am getting 75% success in my career. Is there a way I can improve? Why are successful people so despised? Why can't we all just get along? How can we all get along? How do we manage our lives best in this worl... Everyone makes mistakes at work, including the ones that directly affect our relationships with the people we work with but these are not necessarily going to \u2018ruin\u2019 a career because we can learn and recover from mistakes. It is very important to respect others and being respected by others. I have worked with people who were very much respected for their unmatched expertise at work but not much liked because their emotional intelligence skills were not well balanced. This didn\u2019t ruin their careers but it very definitely stalled it at a level that they were unlikely to move beyond unless they developed those skills. I have also worked with people who were very well liked by their colleagues but their work performance was not well respected. This also stalled careers and made getting promotions or jobs with new employers more challenging. Sometimes the learning is to develop the missing skills and sometimes the learning is to recognize that the type of work or the workplace culture one is in is not well suited to who they are. One can develop skills by identifying what is needed and getting the help needed and this can reset the career track. If it is an acknowledgement that the type of work or the workplace culture is not well suited then one can work towards awareness and assessment of determining what is a better \u2018fit\u2019 for them. Absolutely critical. There are five things that determine your success: who you know, your attitude including self-confidence, what you know, a little luck, and persistence. And the most important of these is Who You Know. Those people you work with are you peers; some of them are going to go on to do big things and if you are in their good graces they may drag you along with their success. If not, they may sink you like an enemy torpedo. I\u2019ve seen it countless times: I even wrote a book about it (Amazon: \u201cLessons on Success from a Failure\u201d by Jay Howard). It\u2019s important to make, massage and develop contacts throughout your career. Nothing - and I mean nothing - propels you to success faster than your contacts. Make certain that you always try to maintain good working relationships, that your attitude is always stellar and that you keep your mouth shut as much as possible - having a reputation as a gossip or a bigmouth will sink you fast. I cannot stress this enough. Good luck. A2A. It depends on the field and the level of talent which is required. If it is a very specific type of talent that only you possess, well, then by golly, it really doesn\u2019t matter if you murdered your colleagues. The Italian mafia is a great example of this and if you are that guy with THE charisma, everyone else is screwed. If you wanted to enter banking, it depends which region of the world you are in. Most of the time, in countries that have a higher level of social conformity, it is expected that you at least PRETEND to get along VERY WELL. In Asia, colleagues are expected to go out and socialize after work. In the US, it really depends on where you are because the inherent cultural difference between San Francisco, Seattle, San Francisco, LA, Chicago, Manhattan, or Boston, is tremendous. At that point, you really would have to observe what others do, though in general, it is more of a professional relationship in the larger cities than something too chummy.",

        "a": "An alternative view: Entire space, outside basic 3D matter-particles, is filled with an all-encompassing universal medium, structured by quanta of matter.Photons (corpuscles of radiation) are the most basic 3D matter-particles. Each photon has a disc-shaped 3D matter-core that spin about one of its diameters. 3D matter-core of a photon is created by universal medium from free quanta of matter available in gaps in universal medium. Universal medium gather free quanta of matter, compresses and molds them into proper shape and moves the 3D matter-core. In order to sustain stability of universal medium and the 3D matter-core of photon, it is imperative for the universal medium to spin it at spin speed proportional to its 3D matter-content and move it at the highest possible (hence constant) linear speed with respect to itself. 3D matter-core and surrounding distortions in universal medium together form a photon. A photon will cease to exist (die), when it loses its 3D matter-content. Photons gradually lose their 3D matter-contents while travelling through great distances. Attempts to decelerate a photon will lead to loss of its 3D matter-content. See:  http://vixra.org/abs/1103.0026  , \u2018MATTER (Re-examined)\u2019 ,  MATTER Do photons, the particles of light, have mass? Do photons die? Are photons considered to be matter? How do photons get trapped? Do photons know I exist? A photon is not a living entity. It isn't given birth to; a photon does not live, and similarly a photon does not die. Photons are discrete packets of energy, or quanta. They are both particles and waves, having energy proportional to their frequency of propagation. Photons are created through many means, like an electron falling from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, or through the energy released from nuclear fission. Photons are absorbed by certain substances. This has a variety of effects, like excitation of electrons, or even the phenomenon of colour. TL;DR : Photons are merely created and destroyed through physical processes. They do not live or die. As photon moves with the speed of light (cosmic speed limit) So time doesn't exist for him Hence it will always stable And hence photon can live as long as universe itself. Photon dies when it collides with any particle and it's velocity becomes  zero.",

What should I do to pursue the career? I have done B.E in Power Engineering. I want to pursue a career in analytics. What are the best institutions in India to go for? Can one do a B.S. in astronomy/astrophysics and an M.S. in Aerospace Engineering? I am a B.Tech (mechanical) graduate and want to pursue my career in astronomy/cosmology. What should I do? What are the best fields in CSE to pursue a career in India? It would be engineering in electronics and communication. Electronics has wide applications in whole multi-messenger astronomy. Second best would be engineering in data science or computer science. Astronomy is going through challenges of handling big data (particularly radio astronomy) and also observational astronomy includes loads of programming (especially research based on astrophysical simulations ) so familiarity with data science and programming would certainly help if u make transition from engg. to science (astronomy). Well the answer is diverse my friend. It basically depends upon which field you want to pursue your studies in astronomy. If you want to go for computational and mathematical astronomy, you should choose Engineering in Mathematics. If you want to go for simulation Astrophysics, you should pursue Computer Science Engineering.

Here are a few that i would like to list out: if you are all set and have a good past record then directly go for a good question bank. So test series like Doprep and embibe will be good. Their papers are a bit tougher at times. So they will keep your preparation a notch higher and you can enhance your score through them. Also a slightly lower score in them would equivalent to a better score in BITSAT so don\u2019t demotivate yourself. If you are not very confident and took a fresh start and motivation after JEE Mains then go for easy tests at start then after 4 to 5 easy tests go for embibe or doprep. So you can start with tcy online. it has slightly easier tests and will help you in getting a start and motivation too. The arihant CD is also a bit tougher than bitsat and can be used for practice since it has solutions too but yes, their papers have certain wrong answers so they might add to your frustration.

I'll work on the assumption that the question refers to being discovered in the pop culture sense. Yes, it is possible. People have varying tastes in music and you can find just about anything in the Internet so it shouldn't really be a question of possibility but that of probability. While I do admit that there are very few people who get discovered because of their low singing voices despite the connotation that low and deep voices are \u201csexy\u201d is due to many factors. One of which is that people with low singing voices shine the brightest in groups so they are not that known to most people.

The group rose to prominence after winning the third season of The Sing-off. Scotty McCreery is someone who I'll mention as well. He won the tenth season of American Idol.

        "a": "A primer on your height & what you can do about it Your height is determined between 60%-85% by your genetics. The remainder of that is environmental, primarily nutrition [1] . If you're malnourished during your growing years you won't reach your full potential. If you get enough nutrition you'll likely reach your genetically predetermined height, possibly a little taller. There is some indications that getting enough protein through your developmental years can add to your height positively. In Japan after the war, the population had access to more fish protein and the average height of the country increased 3 inches [2] . Denmark has become one of the tallest countries in the world, and it's rise in height is strongly correlated to it's wealth per capita . [3]  The most likely take away here is that people that can afford to eat, and eat well, will be taller over generations. It\u2019s easy to make this connection between these two long term correlations. Nutrition can slowly cause an increase in height between generations. It's no guarantee that you'll be taller through eating, but proper nutrition through your formative years, can add a bit onto your genetics. A good, balanced diet of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates -- eat food, not too much, mostly plants -- you'll do fine. They've been doing some research on fraternal twins to try to determine what the specific gene is that determines height. The reason that they're looking at fraternal twins rather than identical twins is that their exact DNA is different but most of the environmental factors are the same (what the mother ate while they were pregnant, probably how they were treated after they were born, etc). They can then compare the genomes of the twins after they reach their height and see what is different between them. They do this for thousands of fraternal twin pairs to determine which parts of their genomes are different. As of writing this they think it's partly in the X chromosome and chromosomes 7, 8, and 20. Scientists haven't narrowed it down entirely, genes are pretty complex and it's not as simple as it's explained in your general science classes with recessive genes and dominant genes. [4] As you grow up, your bones get longer. Everyone has  Epiphyseal plates  at the ends of their bones. As you grow, these plates are added onto. When you go through growth spurts, particularly puberty, they are added onto rather quickly. Some people experience growing pains in their bones as they expand. When you're done growing (mostly by the time you're 18-25), your bones  Ossify , the epiphyseal plates seal themselves, and you stop growing taller and longer. At that point you're done. No more growing. That's it. How do I know if my Epiphyseal plates have sealed? I\u2019m going to quote this answer:  Thomas Johnson's answer to How do you know when your epiphyseal plates are sealed (disregarding age)?  (Please go and up vote his answer if you find this portion illuminating) When looking at an x-ray of your limbs, look for the line between the diaphysis (shaft of the long bone) and epiphysis (rounded articulation/ where the joint lies). Here is a picture of the epiphyseal plates of the distal tibia and fibula in an ankle: You can easily see the dark line above both \"ankles\" or malleoli. These are the epiphyseal plates you are looking for. Here is a picture when the \"growth plates\" are \"sealed\": You can see the white line on both sides of the knee, known as an epiphyseal scar. The white line means the area is more dense, whereas the dark line from before means it is the less dense, growing cartilaginous tissue. If the white line exists, it means the epiphyseal plate has \"closed\" and no additional bone will grow from the cartilage. Daily fluctuations Your height actually decreases slightly through the day. In between your spinal disc s there are fluid sacs. When you stand up your head and shoulders put axial pressure on your spine and cause these sacs to compress. You can shrink by as much as 1% of your height this way (this will not accumulate beyond 1%, 1% is the most you will lose, even by standing up for a month straight) . Simply lying down will allow them to expand again. This isn't a big deal, though there are several sites out there than claim otherwise and claim that they can create extra space between your spinal bones. Additionally there are claims that stretching and hanging can increase your height. This is a quarter true. Hanging and stretching can reverse the compression, making you slightly taller until your spine compresses again. Spinal compression can reduce your height temporarily by 1%. In tall people this can be as much as a half inch. Stretching and hanging and lying down can restore this 1%, but won't make you taller. [5] For this same reason, astronauts can be as much as 2\" taller in space. There's not enough gravity putting axial pressure against their spine to compress it. Additionally, the fluid pressure in the sacs can exceed any forces pressing against them allowing astronauts to expand past that 1%. When they come back to earth, they return to their normal height over the course of months. [6] Your height and sports Because of the growth plates, and the fact that your spine can compress, people got the idea that weightlifting and high impact sports could cause you to not grow as much. They're not quite right. There has been no evidence that weightlifting can stop your growth [7]  . The origins of weightlifting being a thing that stunted your growth came from a couple of places, most recently a 1970s study of Japanese child laborers. The children that did work all day ended up shorter than average [8] . The truth behind the stunted growth is, of course, malnutrition. Child laborers worked long hours and didn't make much money...not nearly enough to feed themselves well. Another reason people used to think weightlifting was bad for children was they didn't develop muscles like you do as an adult. Children don't have enough hormones yet for muscles to develop properly, but what weightlifting can do for them is put stress on the bones encouraging them to grow as well as help them develop their central nervous system allowing pathways to be created for them to do more work as they go into adulthood. A lot of lifting weights is in the head. Recent studies have shown that weight lifting at any young age can help build bones and stave off obesity for children leading into their adulthood. Weight lifting at a young age has also been shown to prevent injuries and osteoporosis into old age. Sports have a tendency to self select. I've seen so many questions: Can basketball make me taller? Can swimming make me taller? These questions are based on the fact that professional basketball players are tall and well known swimmers are tall. The well known players are tall because being tall gives them a distinct advantage in these sports. I swam for 15 years, all through my growing years. I'm 5'7\". It doesn't work like that. Further, basketball is pretty high impact. Short sprints, stops, starts, jumps. If someone thought weight lifting would stunt your growth, basketball would too for the same reasons. Every time you jump you put several times your body weight against your muscles and bones. Much more than you would be weightlifting at that age. The same thing goes with gymnasts. They're not short because the sport makes them short, they're short because it's easier to be a great gymnast when you're short. [9] But it's not quite as simple as that, either. Studies on female gymnasts revealed that in their youth, they show slowed height growth, primarily in their legs. When they stop doing gymnastics, they are able to reach their full potential...gymnasts who start young have decreased bone age compared to people who start later, when they quit, their spine height and legs grow more and fully catch up to where they are predicted to be based on genetics within 8 years of quitting. Men did not experience this at all. Through out their entire growth within the sport, they don't suffer from abnormal bone ages or strange growth patterns and actually end up being as tall as they should be based on genetics even while continuing the sport [10] . The gymnasts they analyzed reached their full genetic height under the conditions analyzed. Most of them were actually just supposed to be short -- their parents were short. It's mainly a correlative link between the sport and the height, possibly connected to nutrition. Several other studies relating to particular sports (ballet, wrestling, distance running) linking to height issues. These sports, along with gymnastics, particularly for females, have rigorous training requirements limiting the time children have to eat. Additionally, the sports themselves put particular demands on the participants weight [11] . It's likely these growth impediments are due more to nutritional deficits rather than something intrinsic to the sport. Studies performed on swimmers, gymnasts, and tennis players also support the  correlation  to height but  not causation  because the participants are actually reaching their appropriate height, not exceeding it. As far as the sport goes, they're just self-selected for their height. Sleep During Developmental There have been a few studies that I was able to find relating to sleep patterns and growth. It's well known that when you sleep your body releases all sorts of hormones and most of your growth and recovery happens at this time. [12]  One would think that a lack of sleep would cause stunted growth. For children aged 5-11 and 1-10 there were a couple studies done. One found a very weak negative correlation between sleep time and height. In neither study did the researchers concluded that the correlation was significant enough to say that sleep correlated with height growth at this age.  [13]   [14] Other studies involving interviews over a couple of years with adolescents found that sleep problems were correlated with lower \"puberty scores\" (that tracks their development to adult-hood). However, an association between height and sleep wasn't noticed, but the researchers noted that more needed to be done [OP Note: I could be reading that wrong, It's possible it wasn't tracked at all, if someone knows better, let me know]. [15] Finally, and much more indicative of likely issues, A study performed on children diagnosed with sleep apnea showed their height was affected negatively by the apnea condition. [16] Based on this research it looks like, based on the apnea research that there could be an issue related to height growth and a significant lack of sleep. In any case, based on the overall benefits of sleep, I'd recommend not skimping on sleep during your growth years, and getting checked out for  apnea  if you have noticed any of the symptoms. Myths Concerning Growing Taller and Stunted Growth There are tons of old wive's tales out there about strategies to grow taller. They might not all hurt you, but they sure won't help. If anyone has any studies that back up any of these strategies, I'd gladly move them from my myths section to my realities section: Skipping . How this is a thing I have no idea, particularly when you look at the myths (and realities) laid out earlier about gymnastics and weightlifting. If weightlifting makes you short (myth) and gymnastics makes you short (partially true, as detailed above), how would skipping (relatively high impact asymmetric leaping from one foot to the other) make you taller? Sports  like: Swimming, basketball, cycling, any others, making you taller, dispelled above. They're amazing activities and can help you grow stronger, faster, smarter, and build team work and leadership skills, but they won't make you taller. Stretching and yoga . Things like \"Growing Tall 4 idiots\". They can help your posture, but as you're growing they won't add inches, they'll just help you express your height. Hanging exercises . They'll decompress your spinal disks allowing you to gain as much as a half inch in the middle of the day, but the gains will only last a few hours. Salt in your shoes . Praying  and  wishful thinking . They might make you feel better, but you won't get taller as a result. Miracle pills  -- things like Ayurvedic Urea, Ayurvedic \"Step Up\".  Snake oil  is a unsubstantiated claim applied to medicines and supplements. Even actual Ayurvedic practitioners will tell you that there is nothing in any Ayurvedic textbook on height increase. All height increase supplements are snake oil. Particular diets and foods (milk, etc) will make you taller . While eating enough is essential to realizing your full potential, there's no evidence that any particular food will have more effect than anything else. There's also no evidence that other animal's growth hormones (like trace amounts of bovine growth hormone in milk) will help you grow taller or stronger. The only diet you need is one that contains a good balance of carbs, proteins, fats, and contains all the vitamins and minerals you need. Particular foods will  stunt your growth .  There is  NO evidence  that coffee stunts your growth [17] . Diet coke does not stunt your growth [18] . The major problems with diet drinks and coffee are that they contain very little in the way of nutrients and can fill up a kid's stomach. Plus, caffeine can be used as an appetite suppressant. All of this adds up to a child not getting enough nutrients. Sodas aren't great because they're packed with sugar. While you need sugar, you don't need the amount a couple sodas give you, and you need other nutrients just as much: proteins, fats, vitamins and electrolytes like potassium and calcium. I kept my kids away from these drinks to keep their appetite going so they have enough room to eat. That particular  activities like weight lifting will stunt your growth , as mentioned above. Exercise releases HGH which will help you grow . Studies on this phenomenon have shown that HGH release through exercise only has an effect on the localized areas that are exercised. Lifting legs releases much more GH than lifting arms. If you work legs and arms in the same day, it will not make your arms stronger than if you lift your arms by themselves even though your body is coursing with GH [19] . There is no reason to think that your height will be affected by GH released through exercise for that reason and there is no evidence to back up that claim. Exercise and weight lifting during puberty is a great thing, it could possibly set you up to be much stronger and healthier throughout your life...just not taller. What can actually be done about your height? There are few things that can be done, and most of these treatments are only responsibly given in cases of abnormalities. As stated above, the best thing you can do is strive to be as tall as you can naturally be by eating properly through your childhood. As mentioned above, by eating a balanced diet with plenty of protein, carbs, and fat, you may be able to exceed genetic expectations by a small amount -- possibly more over several generations of proper eating. Exercise and sports can be helpful in keeping you healthy and generating strong bones, but in the end it won't make you taller than your genes say you will be. Hormone treatment Occasionally, there comes along a case where a child is short, inexplicably. When you bring a short kid into see the doctor, they'll eliminate diet first. Most of the time if the child isn't eating right and then they start eating properly, they'll shoot right up. Some cases, the kid is eating right, but they just aren't growing. To qualify for these cases you usually have to be in the bottom 3rd percentile of your age but you should be higher, based on genetic predictors. In those cases HGH treatments have shown that they can grow over 9 centimeters over the adjusted predictions [20] . If this is the case for you, see a doctor and ask them about it. They'll usually do tests to determine if your body isn't generating enough hormones. If it is generating enough, a responsible doctor won't give you more. It's not safe to mess around with the endocrine system. Too much of different hormones introduced artificially can make glands stop producing normally and shrink. Spinal Conditions There are a number of conditions that can make you appear shorter. Scoliosis : Kyphosis : Getting these conditions diagnosed and treated can add several inches to your effective height, making you appear the height that you are. Posture Additionally, a lot of people experience bad posture. Later in life you won't grow taller, but if you get in the gym, start being active and focus on standing up straight and tall you can fully express your height. There's no special exercise you need to do (back exercises can help like Straight Leg Dead Lifts) but it's more a focus on being active and standing tall. Keep your head level, looking forward, not up or down. Chest out Shoulder blades back and tucked down, like you're trying to make your neck longer Slightly flexed abs for support Pelvic floor neutral Surgery There is a controversial, expensive, painful, high risk surgery with a very long recovery time called  Distraction osteogenesis . They break your tibia and fibula then affix a device to keep them separated: You while this is taking place you cannot put weight on your bone and you have to undergo 1-2 hours of physical therapy daily to keep the bones from getting stiff. This process can take months to complete. After the new bone is formed there is another 6 months strengthening time period where you need to carefully strengthen the bone without the lengthening device. The entire process can take as long as 2 years. Even after all that there are dozens of complications: The new bone may not form solidly and there's a good chance of breakage within 2-3 months The new bone may not form in the proper angle You might not grow the expected 2-3 inches Your leg lengths may not be even afterwards An infection can be catastrophic Nerve damage could cause you to lose the leg entirely. Usually the only time they do this surgery is to correct cases where one leg is significantly shorter than the other. Because of the recovery process any credible doctor will have the patient go through a psych evaluation prior to the surgery to validate that they can handle the recovery process. Personally, it sounds dangerous, risky, and pointless.  [21] Look Taller There\u2019s a few strategies to help you appear to be taller as well. Shoes Wear shoes with bigger heels. At certain point you could be pushing the bounds of traditional fashion, but if you feel like you can rock it, by all means: Insoles/Risers You can get insoles called risers that can make a normal shoe act like high heels and push you up without having anything look different externally. Combine the two and you could add several inches. Clothes that fit When you wear clothes that actually fit you, it can make you appear longer than normal, particularly skinny jeans and shirts that aren\u2019t baggy. Going along with that one: Working out You don\u2019t need to get massive or muscular and you don\u2019t need to get super skinny. Keeping your body fat down can contribute to your looking lean (not to mention being and looking healthy). Getting your body down below 20% body fat for a man should be a goal for both health and looking good. At this point clothes will fit better and give you longer lines. Wear horizontal stripes This one\u2019s a little counter intuitive, but it\u2019s been backed up by science [ What Makes You Look Fat: Vertical or Horizontal Lines? ] Horizontal stripes actually make you look thinner and taller than vertical ones. Taller hair Putting your hair in a more vertical alignment will make your face look longer helping give the impression of height. Exude confidence Easier said than done, but a self-confident person always appears larger than they actually are. When all else fails: Get some painting stilts. The Outliers Finally, in contradiction to everything I said above, there are some people who have conditions like a tumor affecting their pituitary gland which controls certain growth hormones. They often experience uncontrollable growth. The tallest man in the world, Sultan Kosen --  Tallest man - living Before you start researching how you can give yourself a pituitary tumor, people afflicted with this after puberty will see their hands and feet grow continuously along with their skin thicken, soft tissues grow and organs increase in size. It's not a pleasant condition. [22] Height is not everything In closing, there's nothing wrong with being short. Some of the most powerful men in the world have been short. Your height doesn't make you a better person, it doesn't make you more attractive or less attractive, at least to people that matter. What matters more than anything else is how you project yourself. The more confident you are, the more you can accomplish and that has nothing to do with your height. Tom Cruise 5'6\" 5'5\" (4th President of the United States and Father of the US Constitution, only 5' 4\" (the statue on the campus of JMU is supposedly true to life, he was short, but powerful) Nick Saban  5\u20326\u2033, Current Football Coach of Alabama Crimson Tide, rated by Forbes as \u201cThe Most Powerful Coach in College Sports\u201d, highest paid public employee of the State of Alabama, only coach lead 2 schools to 5 National college football championships. Muggsy Bouges, 5'3\" 15 year NBA veteran. Make the most of who you are, it doesn't matter if people physically look down on you right now if you can make your mark on history.

Does weight loss lead to height increase? How can I increase my height after I'm 23 years old? Does hanging temporarily increase height at all? Does jogging help to increase height? I wish someone had advised me as a teenager, t he things I am going to suggest to you.  As you're a teenager you will continue to grow till you get to around the age of 20. When you get beyond 20 years of age, then research suggests the chances of growing are remote.  However I have heard of some people who have claimed they have grown an inch or two even in their twenties. As you said  genetics  plays a great role in determining your height, but so does  diet, exercise, lifestyle and where you live. The Netherlands is known to have the tallest average height for both men and women, just over 6' and 5'6'' respectively. Their average height has grown rapidly over the past 150 years and a good diet is suggested to be part of the reason explaining why this has happened.  (Source:  www.theguardian.com ) Diet I have two relatively tall sons. In terms of  diet  I give them a balanced diet for their meals, but ensure they get plenty of proteins in the form of  eggs, chicken, fish, red meat, lentils, beans  and so forth. It is also important to eat plenty of  fruit and vegetables everyday, either cut and served or in the form of fresh juice or smoothies.   I made this smoothie today. I also include lots of  nuts and seeds  in our diet. In addition, I\u00a0 have learnt from experience that both children and adults benefit from drinking  milk  too. As it contains calcium it is very important for growth and development. In some countries including the USA,  vitamin D is added to milk for added benefits for bone growth and health . However if you're from the UK as I am, milk is not fortified with vitamin D. I also check and buy  cereals fortified with calcium, iron and vitamin D . If you're from a country with a warmer climate, then you can naturally obtain the benefits of the sunshine vitamin. Exercise It is very important to include stretching into your exercise regime. I follow a famous yoga guru from India and firmly believe in the benefits of yoga and the science of ayurveda, Yoga exercises you could include are  the cobra,  which stretches your spine. The surya namaskar (sun salutation) should be practised in the mornings. It's not only excellent for stretching its also a great way to start your day as it exercises your whole body. It is also known to make the  pituitary gland which controls growth and development  to function properly. However it is important to start this exercise either with a professional yoga instructor or through a step by step video guide. I learnt this from a yoga instructor when I was living in India.  Lifestyle I remember reading an answer by  Jimmy Wales  outlining the importance of a good nights sleep.  How many hours per night generally does Jimmy Wales sleep? \u00a0 Another reason to get a good nights sleep (around 8 hours) is because it can help you grow taller. The pituitary gland is known to work and release hormones to aid growth whilst you sleep.  In addition I would suggest including a sport into your lifestyle for aid your growth, enable you to stretch your full body and for general well being.  Basketball  players are all tall, maybe its a sport you could consider. I know of someone in our family who took up this sport recently and his height shot up!!  Swimming is also a good total body workout. I would end by adding that these suggestions are merely courses of action you could include in your daily routine which may increase your height, however the main thing is that implementing such measures into your lifestyle can only make your healthier and happier.\u00a0 In any case a persons height is only  one  way to measure how attractive someone is, as is physical appearance.  Other non-physical characteristics and traits such as intelligence, honesty, loyalty, self confidence and so forth play a bigger role in defining a person's true level of appeal.  I'm not entirely sure but I think even  Jimmy Wales  is around 5'6\", but this fact is so insignificant as he his famous for his personality and social contributions not for how tall he is. There are so many other famous personalities across the globe whose height has not stopped them from achieving their goals in life.  If you would like to  appear  taller, might I suggest  holding a gun According a UCLA study titled \"Weapons Make the Man (Larger): Formidability is Represented as Size and Strength in Humans,\" men holding guns appeared to be  17% taller  than men without a gun.   Why? We view foes as larger than they really are. Nonverbal cues tied to perceived dominance come into play. If you are unarmed and see someone armed, you are more likely to view them as larger in order to persuade yourself to not engage them as a foe. The full study is available for free  http://www.plosone.org/article/i... Disclaimer: Don't try this at home. I will make this a modified combination of my 2 previous answers as they fit just perfectly. You don't, you can't. There are no proven \"exercises\" or magical pills that will make you taller. You are still 18, you can still grow taller; I did. And here is what would be your best bet at supporting and increasing whatever chances you still might have: First of all things, even if not for height, but for just general well being - eat healthy, sleep moderately and rest plenty. You can never have any negative effects from doing this anyway. Secondly, you can add few inches to your height simply by improving your posture (note that most people have a bad posture). Here is the video by Elliott Hulse explaining how to fix your posture and appear taller. Exercises that Make You Taller by Elliott Hulse (Note that this is just how Elliott named the video and he himself says exercises like that do not exist in the first few seconds of the video) And lastly, as much as I do not recommend it, it has to be mentioned: Bone Lengthening surgery. This is something should not never be performed at all in my opinion for how many risks it carries... But it is people's money, life and it is essentially for them to decide. Just searched  Advanced search - PubMed - NCBI  comprising of 23 million citations from scientific biomedical literature, no hits when searching for niacin AND growth hormone, neither for niacin AND growth. So,  no scientific studies to that effect . What \"studies\" are you referring too? A web search only came up with the usual unscientific \"natural\" promoting websites.\u00a0 Be aware that glowing testimonials aren't proof nor science. As docs we have been prescribing niacin for a long time to try to improve our patient's serum lipid profile by raising HDL cholesterol (\"good cholesterol\"), unfortunately trials didn't support us doing so since it didn't lower cardiovascular morbidity/mortality  Effect on cardiovascular risk of high density lipoprotei...

        "a": "Hi! Every customer is a backbone of every business. Reality shows that heavy percentage of clients refuse to deal with the company just because of bad customer support experience. 80% of companies think they deliver best support practices, but only 8% of their customers think the same. Customers are the lifeblood of every company. Your client is your future revenue and feedback on your services. (Statistics shows that more than 75% of customers leave their good feedbacks, and only 45% leave feedbacks of dissatisfaction). In such case, every CEO should create an amazing customer service management to provide clients with best support solutions. If you need some tips to conduct such process in the best way, just read our blog: How To Manage A Customer Service Team - read our 5 tips Thank you for your attention) What influence do customers have on a business? How can a customer influence a business? How do managers influence a business? What is the sphere of influence in business? What are the external influences in IT based business? Your question implies that they do, whereas in fact the relation between customers and company is a subject to a multi-layered dependencies in many contexts. Therefore, assumption in the question is a little defying its purpose.  Much like asking \u201cWho is the most beautiful woman in the USA and why Kim Kardshian?\u201d For a small shop in a village, sourcing its produce from local farmers it is important to be perceived as local (think \u201chipster\u201d and way before it got trendy).  For the big corporation providing services in a highly competitive and fast pacing environment it may well be still important. That however, largely depends on how their clients were \u201cconditioned\u201d to be consumers. Not so much so in a highly regulated bank sector or a compulsory financial product such as car insurance (which in fact in its modern form is shaped like a delegated tax duty collection, this time by a private business or perhaps a cartel). In a very idealistic/simplistic model, say in so-called \" agile \" you are talking about a \" feedback loop \" or \u201c product ownership \u201d which has three-fold meaning: it provides a \u201c guestimated \u201d, incremental, fit-for-purpose check for new products under development, creates illusion for clients that they influence the process ( but they don't, for it's a largely prescriptive and highly technical process, hence very hermetic to most of the outsiders without domain competence ), and - by the conjunction of the two, it builds an effective marketing vessel going under the radar of usually suspicious clients. There is also a number of non-product or service specific influences like \" corporate responsibility \" or \" ethical \" codes of conduct. All this however can be accounted for as \u201c bogus \u201d and again, it serves largely as a catchy narrative to diversify the product from it's background - to give it an edge over competition. Another major bullshit aspect of \u201c you are in charge \u201d illusion is the  surveys conducted by the businesses themselves . At best it serves an early warning system, but usually it only gives a forum to a disgruntled client to vent his negative emotions so that his harmful potential as a source for bad \u201c word of mouth \u201d is suppressed or defused. The only market I can imagine the influence to be somewhat real  is the professional services between companies. But in order to see this working they both need to have an organisational capacity to screen and evaluate each other\u2019s performance and satisfaction. With the ever-growing outsourcing, driving costs down through economic \u201c externalization \u201d it is not likely to be around for much longer. Customers determine the continuity of one\u2019s business. If no one is patronizing the latter\u2019s venture then there would exist no sales therefore no profit for the business and no fund to continue such. Customers are the reason why offshore call centre solutions are established. By outsourcing customer service to them, since they are trained to do such, the client\u2019s business would be able to efficiently handle customers\u2019 concerns to keep them loyal to the business. I believe that customers are a great advertising influence. My small business Gotcha Covered Sheds, Gotcha Covered Sheds Needs customers that are happy with a service, they then tell other people about the service they got be it good or bad but preferably good. If 1 customer is happy and they know someone needs my product they will then sell that person on my product. It's a great marketing system by word of mouth but also using their experience to get others to buy. If I have just 1 happy customer and he tells his friend I've got an interested party that may be influenced to purchase a shed.",

        "a": "Publix blows past $30 billion record in annual revenue .  (granted, a year old) They\u2019re just damned good. (okay, that was clumsy \u2026 more on that in a sec). It\u2019s really hard to do well in retail. But here\u2019s the kicker, grocery stores that are well run will remain a necessity for the foreseeable future (and in a world with grocery delivery, local stores have the edge anyway). There was a time when grocery stores were considered the weak man of any brand (SuperTarget and Super Walmart included). Food is hard an it involves a lot of waste. As a former retail guy, I still have it in my blood. I once had a buddy who was a DJ. The real kind, where he spun records and mixed music. He told me that for people like him, there\u2019s no way to enjoy the music anymore. He habitually counts beats and it\u2019s basically all he hears. Once you turn on that mechanism, it\u2019s all you hear. Once you work in retail, Quora User can attest, it\u2019s there forever. You see the little things. Is that grime pushed up against the kickplate when they mopped? I see they forgot to strip the wax totally around that corner, you can see the darker color. Their pricetags are all fucked up, they\u2019re cockeyed and they don\u2019t align with the products. Oh look, somebody only faced the front row of the bottles rather than do a proper FIFO and pull the whole lot forward. Why are there five tiles (usually a 10 or 12 inches) between the aisles here but four of them in the next one, then back to five again? Someone didn\u2019t measure the shelf spacing properly. Jeezis people, take your shopping carts out back once every six months and power-wash them. (huge pet peeve of mine) OOh \u2014 is that a new display case? Looks fancy-schmancy! You see the little things. I\u2019ve YET to be in a Publix where the little things weren\u2019t taken care of. Granted, I\u2019ve only been here five months now. But I\u2019ve been to a number of Publix(es?). It\u2019s the little things that matter. You could perform surgery on their floors. They\u2019re that clean. The people are despicably kind. I have never been to a store where someone didn\u2019t pop out of the woodwork and ask to carry my bags out. Their team members on the floor are ubiquitous and fall-over-themselves ready to help you. Even when I told the guy, \u201cJust point me to the aisle where you keep the Mio and I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d [I am, after all, a retail guy] Nope. The young buck insisted on walking me to the spot, smiling and asking me if he could help me with anything else. The prices are very good, competitive and even when not, yeah. I don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t have that  frelling  \u201ccard\u201d that other grocery stores make you carry. Just put your number in the key pad and the coupons populate. Good selection on everything (nowhere near GiantEagle\u2019s Market District which I still insist is the Disneyland of Food). The quality on the stuff they make in the store (which, BTW, is where the real profit comes from) is all top notch. I **HATE** grocery store bakeries. HATE THEM. They all use the same gritty, insipid frosting. They all make the same boring bread. They all sell the same crap luncheon meats. Not Publix. Sure, I\u2019m not passionate about everything they make, but they carry two lines of luncheon meat: super-premium (Boar\u2019s Head) and kind of okay (Publix Brand). Their bakery makes some hideously addictive bread and dessert. The vegetables are all damned near perfect. Speaking of the Publix in-house brand. No reason to buy anything else unless you know unequivocally that it\u2019s way better. The Publix in-house brand is pretty damned good in everything. Speaking of Publix in-house things. They have a sub shop that is damned good and makes suspiciously good fried chicken. Why does Publix make you shave? What are the benefits of working at Publix? What are Publix digital coupons? Who makes Publix soda? How is it made? What is it like to wear the Publix uniform? Publix became successful, because it was the first supermarket with air conditioning. Something chains in Florida had never thought of doing\u2026 It made shopping a pleasure  and people loved being inside Publix stores. That combined with cold-cases for refrigerated/frozen foods, an in-store donut shop, and a flowershop allowed them to become the first grocery chain to dominate central Florida in the forties. Publix stayed successful by sticking to its values of making shopping a pleasure. Publix does special things like taking groceries to your car for you (and not accepting tips). It\u2019s even store policy for employees to walk you to an item if you ask where it is. Publix is pretty kind to employees too. They give stocks to people who work there a long time and everyone in management has worked in a Publix as a worker at some point in time. Fantastic marketing campaigns and accepting competitor coupons in some stores has helped tremendously. All of this combined has made Publix extremely successful in a very tough industry to compete in. They started out high end and worked to get prices down, which seems to work a lot better than the other way around. 30 years ago Publix was the more expensive of the Big 3 in Florida supermarkets at the time - Publix, Albertson\u2019s, and Winn Dixie. Over time they\u2019ve kept their standards while becoming much more competitive with pricing. They have the nicest stores. An old Publix is more cramped than a new one but it isn\u2019t any dirtier. They maintain their stuff like no one else in the business. Walking into a 50 or 60 year old Publix is like time travel. A new from the ground up store is like a cathedral of groceries. I don\u2019t like the Publix in Asheville (it was going to be a K-Mart until it turned out that there wouldn\u2019t be any new K-Marts), too warehousey, but they probably don\u2019t miss me since it seems their biggest problem is 200+ parking spaces aren\u2019t enough. They use their pharmacy as a draw and loss leader, just like Walmart. In fact they go toe to toe with Walmart when it comes to their inside pharmacy - same deals, same free prescriptions. They operate in markets that have significant populations of older people. The pharmacy is a big, big deal and they understand that. They don\u2019t have the best meat in town, but they do have one of the best meat counters. That\u2019s because of the employees. If you don\u2019t see it, ask. If they don\u2019t have it they\u2019ll butcher some for you. Most meat counter people practically run when they see someone who looks like they want something. Extremely reliable selection of very good produce at every store. A lot of recipe delivery services could learn some things from Publix. Everything you need in one case (the newest store I went to had the pans and utensils hanging near by). Pick up a free binder and laminated recipe card right there. It\u2019s actually more convenient than Blue Apron or Home Chef - you have to buy milk anyway so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re never going to the grocery store again. Super high quality private label products. I like most of them better than their branded competitors. Because some people are willing to pay what I like to call a \u201cSanity Tax\u201d. Yes, it's more expensive than Walmart, or Winn-Dixie in my area, but after having to deal with these and other lower-priced supermarkets in my past, now that I am making a little more money at my job, I am willing to pay the Sanity Tax. The last thing I want to do with my time after working all day is to go fight through the droves of people at Walmart, and then sit in one of only three lines so long my frozen foods have thawed enough to slush around. Or, because no one else is working the other six or so registers, I could try and take an entire cart full of items through their \u201cself-checkout\u201d lanes, in which I constantly have to fight the \u201c Unexpected item in bagging area!!! Holy shit we have a thief here!! \u201d announcments, which sometimes lock the whole thing up until the sole attendant can come over to each self-checkout repeatedly like playing whack-a-mole. So much fun. No. I work hard; I have gotten a raise for it\u2026I prefer to (when I can) go to where \u201cShopping is a Pleasure\u201d. I walk in, and am greeted by cheerful people. I show even the slightest hint of body language that I can't find an item, and someone on the floor is there to help without me asking. The selection and quality are commensurate with the higher price. The aisles are clean, bright (nothing like shopping practically in the dark because they're \u201cpassing the savings on to me\u201d), and wide enough for people to pass each other without jousting. Checkout is typically under five minutes, as all lanes are open. The cashiers and baggers are pleasant and bright-eyed. Most baggers in my area are students, and display none of the usual teenage indifference, and are instead very helpful. When I am by myself and have a particularly large load, the option to have someone help me out to the car is appreciated. Sanity Tax. I will pay it thankfully to Publix when I am able. The one I visit: Is visually beautiful. Its displays are inviting and colorful. The selection of products is extensive. They excel in variety. It's  freezing!  Escaping the blazing Florida heat into that air-conditioned oasis is simply delightful. It's clean. Military inspectors would be pleased with the level of cleanliness. The staff are folksy, friendly, helpful - really pleasant to interact with. It's expensive, but the overall shopping experience, as well as the variety and esthetic arrangement of foods, definitely make it worth the prices. I hope this is helpful.",

        "a": "The primary function of a futures market is to transfer risk. Think of two examples- You are a corn farmer. You will be harvesting 1000 bushels of corn in 3 months and will obviously need to sell it. In 3 months time, you cannot be certain what the going rate for corn will be You can lock in the price for your corn in 3 months today by selling a futures contract. In essence, you enter a contract that says you will sell your 1000 in three months, at a price that is determined today. You now no longer have corn price risk. You are protected from a decline in corn pricing, but you give up the upside if corn prices increase. Next example- You are a large company that makes corn tortillas You are always exposed to the risk of your main raw ingredient, corn You can lock in the price of corn for whatever timeframe you want, by purchasing futures contracts. You have the reverse of what the corn farmer did- you agree to purchase a certain amount of corn in three months, at a price that is determined today. You no longer have risk associated with the price of corn. You are protected from an increase in the price of corn, but you give up potential cost savings if the price of corn goes down. Both of those entities are called \u201cnaturals\u201d as they are in businesses that deal directly with corn. Speculators and market makers also trade in futures markets, and they take on risk (as opposed to getting rid of risk), providing liquidity to the market which makes it easier for the naturals to get their transactions done.

        "a": "Are you talking about large power grid systems or commercial and residential? For a home or individual building - solar, wind, geothermal, hydro. What you may not know is that there are also hybrid systems such as combo solar and wind. There are also micro-hydro systems and small-scale wind systems which are appropriate for homes. It is also very important to reduce your energy usage at the same time you contemplate renewables. That will take you towards net-zero-energy homes or even potentially beyond. There are many articles on different energy solutions and energy conservation for the home on our website -  Elemental.Green Here is the energy specific section  Energy | Elemental Green Be sure to click through to older entries at the bottom or search for your specific need. There are over 400 articles on the site covering a range of sustainable home building products and inspiration. What is the need of alternative fuels? What is the best alternate energy? Which plants or minerals can be used as an alternate to fuel? Which will be the best fuel for future? Which is the best site to check fuel prices? Electricity is not a fuel. Electricity is a means of moving energy from one place to another, from where it is produced to where it\u2019s needed. A FUEL is a substance that is by definition used up in a machine that produces power in some form, such as rotary motion, for example diesel fuel in a diesel engine, or coal in a power plant that uses the coal to produce steam, which in turn is used to drive the generators, etc. When the term \u201calternative fuel\u201d is used, it is generally used to mean alternatives to oil, coal and natural gas. For the moment, the most PRACTICAL alternative fuel for motor vehicles is ethanol, since it is easily produced and can be shipped and distributed using the same infrastructure used to distribute gasoline. But it is not possible to produce enough ethanol to use it as a substitute for more than a very minor fraction of all the oil we use these days. Hydrogen is a good alternative fuel, in some respects, but it\u2019s very tough to store and to transport it, and it\u2019s very hard to get enough of it into a tank that will fit into a car to go very far, unless the car is an electric car equipped with a fuel cell. So far, such cars are too expensive and only a handful are built each year, but someday they might be cheap enough to be practical. Hydrogen can be produced using electricity produced at wind and solar farms, and eventually, hydrogen will be pretty cheap, once we have enough wind and solar farms built. A couple of other alternative engine fuels are ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. Then there are biofuels such as oils produced by algae, but none of these last three are practical options at this time. Some people consider synthetic oil manufactured from coal to be an alternative fuel, others do not. If coal stays cheap, and oil gets to be expensive, coal to liquid works, but the environmental cost of it is high. One of the primary objections to nuclear power is the unfounded fear of it exploding or killing people with radiation. It is unfortunate that this false fear has developed and continues to be fanned by Hollywood and novels and the exaggerated or incorrect association with Chernobyl and Fukushima. Given the human psychology of not allowing facts to quell irrational fears, it is unlikely that we will change people's minds about this issue in the near future. There is some hope that the younger generation will be more receptive to nuclear power at some time in the future but that may be many decades from now. We will most likely encounter or pass Peak Oil and continue to exacerbate the climate change problem before we can count on general public support for nuclear power. Unfortunately, our demand for power may not allow us to wait that long - thus, creating a seemingly irresolvable problem. Perhaps not. It might be useful to try to imagine a compromise solution that will satisfy the irrational fears of the generally uninformed public with the technical issues of demand, base load and pollution issues. Until now, no such compromise has been proposed\u2026\u2026Until now. Hydrogen fueled power is generally acknowledged as the ideal fuel of the future. If can be created from water and when burned, it returns to water. Nuclear power is the only non-carbon based fuel that is capable of economically creating hydrogen from water using some of the more recent high temperature reactor designs. What if we put nuclear reactors at some far away location - Northern Canada - and use them to create hydrogen and then pipe that back to the States. The location would not likely engender a great deal of opposition since it could be placed far away from any population centers - far enough north that it could tap into the Arctic waters. Few would argue about a pipe line that transferred hydrogen since a leak would present only minimum threat of fire or explosion but not pollution or contamination. Using modular-built pebble-bed reactors or molten-salt IFR's would resolve most of the opposition arguments about excessive spent fuel or supplying nuclear weapons. These newer reactor designs are designed to be \u201cwalk-away safe\u201d, so meltdowns and explosions are essentially impossible. It would be possible to use the same nuclear plant to create fresh water from the ocean water and to retain the oxygen gas for other applications. Since it would not be primarily an electric power station, it would not need a distribution grid infrastructure but it could provide the power needed to support the immediate local economy of employee homes and businesses. There certainly would be a number of people that would be willing to work at a premium salary at a remote location to keep the plants operational. Once there is a ready and cheap supply of hydrogen, the cost-effective sales of fuel-cells for small scale power production (in the home), hydrogen powered cars and even hydrogen powered base-load electrical power plants would be viable options. Eventually, we could transition to a hydrogen fuel economy for most of our power production needs. **Of course, there are fuel applications that the lower energy density of hydrogen would not work for - like aircraft fuels - but it would eliminate fossil fuel use in perhaps 75\u201390% of its current uses. That would lower pollution and extend out Peak Oil for centuries. High energy density electrical storage would eventually solve most of our needs for a complete break from all fossil fuels.** The technology to accomplish this exists now. The arguments against it would weak, at best and the benefits to do it would be large and paradigm changing. It's worth considering.",

When Krypton exploded due to its unstable radioactive core, a piece of the planet containing Argo City survived, although like the rest of the planet\u2019s pieces it turned into kryptonite, which is lethal to Kryptonians. However, somehow the inhabitants of the city, including Zor-el and his wife, were able to wrap lead shielding around the land\u2019s surface to protect themselves from the kryptonite radiation. (There was never much explanation of how they managed that feat.) Some years later a meteor shower struck Argo City, ripping open the lead shielding and thus resulting in the deaths of all its residents except for Zor-el\u2019s infant daughter Kara, who like her cousin was sent to Earth in a rocket ship which was conveniently ready for near-immediate launch. She was placed in an orphanage under the name Linda Lee and later adopted by the Danvers family, while trained by her older cousin to become a super-heroine, although at first her existence as Supergirl was kept secret from humanity.

        "a": "I'll tackle the first part of your request in 2 parts: 1) \"How do you rationalize that it is OK to test (torture) animals if it may cure AIDS but not OK to test animals for makeup?\" a) It's not morally justifiable to test anything on nonhuman animals. Period.\u00a0 I'll explain why: Nonhuman animals have the right to not be tested on. There are no exceptions to this; they simply have that right. What happens is, we engage in the immoral action of testing on them anyway, even though we do not have the right to do this - we basically believe that because we have the ABILITY to torture them, that we have the right to torture them. This is not logically or morally sound at all - it violates Nonhuman Animals Rights in exactly the same way that testing on human babies violates Human Rights. To fully understand this, you first must understand that human animals are not morally superior to nonhuman animals. Here is something I wrote a while back on this subject: Human animals created moral codes because most of us believe that enslaving, raping, torturing and murdering other humans is wrong. \"Normal\" adult human animals are moral agents, while nonhuman animals, infant humans, and severely mentally challenged humans (among others) are moral patients.  In order to be a moral agent, one must be capable of abstract thought in order to have a minimum understanding of the meaning of morality. That is to say, moral agents can understand the concept of morality and can therefore make moral decisions. They can make decisions that affect the interests of both moral agents and moral patients. Furthermore, moral agents have moral responsibilities to both other moral agents and moral patients. Moral patients, on the other hand, cannot understand the human concept of morality and are thus incapable of giving informed consent. Informed consent means that an explicit meeting of the minds takes place (via spoken or written language, and no less) where both parties are capable of abstract thought, understand what the nature of the social contract is and what the general future ramifications of the agreement are. Moral patients cannot make moral decisions that affect either moral agents nor moral patients. They do not have moral responsibilities. This is why, for instance, it's wrong for an adult human to murder another human, and also why it's wrong for an adult human to have sex with a human child. This is also why civilized people believe that humans having sex with nonhuman animals is also wrong. Our moral code is there to keep civilized society from breaking down and becoming dictatorships and survival of the fittest scenarios. Justice has at it's core the idea of fairness. For instance, if we say that it's wrong to intentionally inflict suffering and death on a human animal merely because it suits our trivial, selfish interests (we want something they have, we don't like them, etc.) then it would be equally wrong to do that to a nonhuman animal, for the same reasons. This is because we believe that it would be wrong for any human to inflict suffering and death on US merely for their own pleasure, amusement or convenience. We don't hold nonhuman animals morally culpable to this code simply because we understand that, like severely mentally disabled adult humans and human babies,\u00a0 nonhumans are incapable of understanding and abiding by human moral codes (or at least, any truly rational human understands that they are not capable of this) plus the fact that, regarding their interactions with us, they almost always, by default, follow our moral codes better than we do regarding our interactions with other humans (and even moreso, with nonhumans). A universal code of conduct of this sort is called \"a moral baseline\" and the one that makes the most sense in terms of covering all our moral bases would be to cause the least amount of unnecessary harm to any feeling being that we can, aka \"The Golden Rule\" aka \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" The only reason we believe in justice as a society is because we recognize that without some system of justice, we would have much more suffering and death happening to US than we are prepared to accept. In other words, we recognize that with a justice system in place, we have a way to coherently structure a minimization of the unnecessary suffering and death that humans will seek to inflict on other humans merely for their own selfish interests. Although human animals created a concept of morality, many humans commonly break the moral codes imposed by society. This is why we have human slavery, rape, torture, murder, and all the other atrocities that civilized humans abhor. Nonhuman animals, however, while they cannot understand the concept of a moral code, almost always follow our moral codes better than we do. They do not enslave us, create concentration camps, weapons of mass destruction, torture chambers, or pollute or otherwise destroy our habitats. Nor do they wage war on humans, or any of the other atrocities that humans are guilty of. They merely wish to be left alone to live and die on their own terms. On the other side of the coin, humans enslave, rape, torture and murder nonhumans by the hundreds of billions each year, merely because we enjoy the taste of their dead bodies and secretions and the conveniences that it affords us. And we also are intentionally destroying every wild habitat that we can. We regularly treat nonhumans worse than we would treat the worst human criminals. So who is morally superior to whom again? The idea that we should be able to do these things because say, a lion eats a zebra is ridiculous in the extreme. A male lion often will kill a rival male and their offspring before copulating, in public no less, with the mother. If a mother lioness gives birth to a severly ill or deformed baby, she will usually cannibalize them. When applied to human contexts, do we think these are morally justifiable ways to behave? Unless you can explain how human animals are morally superior to nonhuman animals, whenever you try to justify humans exploiting nonhuman animals in the ways that we do, you can't rule out humans exploiting human animals for the exact same reasons (our mere pleasure, amusement or convenience). All you have to do is watch the nightly news to see that we're already doing this. As I mentioned, we very rarely hold completely to our optimal code of conduct. We claim, as a society, to believe in this Golden Rule, but we routinely inflict massive unnecessary suffering and death on innocent beings merely for our pleasure, amusement, or convenience. I mean, we enslave, rape, torture and murder upwards of a trillion nonhuman animals EACH YEAR merely so we can eat their flesh and secretions and use their body parts for clothing (among other things), which not only causes massive suffering for them, but massive amounts of chronic disease for us and massive ecological devastation as well. We should realize that if we don't follow this system of justice regarding EVERY innocent animal, human or nonhuman, then the same arguments we use to attempt to justify inflicting unnecessary suffering and death on them (\"that animal isn't as smart as I am\", \"they don't have souls\", \"it's how I make a living\", \"meat/fish/dairy/eggs/honey tastes good\", etc.) can also be used by other humans to justify inflicting unnecessary suffering and death on US (\"that person isn't as smart as I am\", \"I'm one of the chosen people and that person isn't\", \"I wanted their stuff\", \"rape feels good\", etc.). The idea that humans or nonhumans have absolute rights is called \"Deontology\" in case you're not familiar with terminology in moral philosophy. Seen in this context, we can tell that nonhuman animals have the absolute right not to be used as research subjects. It doesn't matter if we could save a trillion humans by torturing one nonhuman - torturing the nonhuman violates their right not to be tortured, for the same reason that torturing one human violates their right to the same consideration. The idea that we should be able to \"save\" a set number of beings by harming a different set of beings is a product of a philosophy called \"Utilitarianism\" which is itself a product of a philosophy called \"Consequentialism,\" which is a system whereby the ends justify the means. In other words, you should be able to commit harms to X amount of beings if \"more than X\" will benefit. So in Utilitarian terms, if I can save a billion humans by torturing a million humans to death, it's morally justifiable. However, since we think nonhuman animals are morally inferior to humans, instead of bothering to torture humans, we would just torture nonhumans instead... our double-standard in this issue shows that when we use Utilitarian methods to determine our actions, we are severely morally confused. The truth is, either both humans and nonhumans have the right to not be tortured to save some other beings, or neither of us do.  b) More humans are harmed because we use nonhumans as test subjects than if we didn't use them at all. In order to understand why, you should have a look through this post I made. It has many links, but in most of them, the gist is that we've actually maimed or killed many many humans because using animals in testing does not give accurate results: http://legacyofpythagoras.wordpr... 2) \"Regardless of the reason for animal testing, how do you ensure that it's safe for humans if you don't test it with animals or humans?\" The fact is that it's much safer for humans if we first test cures on non-animal models (computer models, human cell samples, etc.) and then graduate to testing on humans (we already test on humans for most cures - we just immorally and inefficiently test on nonhuman animals first). This is covered in depth in the link I provided above. To learn more about Animal Rights, check out this list: http://legacyofpythagoras.wordpr... Why do some people find it more ethical to kill and eat plants rather than animals? Why should I value animals more than plants? What are the arguments for and against animal testing? Is animal testing ethical? What are your views on animal testing? Why is animal testing considered to be good? What are some books on how to extract DNA? The ethics of animal testing is 3R which is Reduce, Refine, Replace. Reduce. This means that the usage of laboratory animal (in term of quantity) must be reduced as possible without compromising the experiment result (in term of statistical significance). Refine. This means that any methodology applied to the laboratory animal must be refined so that the method does not inflict severe pain/stress to the laboratory animal as possible. Replace. In case that the objective of the research can be achieved by other method than animal study, laboratory animal must not be used. This 3R concept is applied to all laboratory animal, which include rat, mice, rabbit and so on.",

So that means he loves us both? There is very little you can do to assuage her insecurities. Anything you do would be temporary in her mind, because the root cause of her insecurity is in her, not you. My best advice is to tell her that she has to love you and the relationship you both share for what it is, not what she wants it to be. She has to accept that there are not guarantees in a relationship. It may last forever. It may not. She may get hurt. You may get hurt. That is the reality of any relationship with passion and love. There is simply no way to tell the future, so both of you have to work on the present as best you can. And she should learn to experience the best of your time together when it is good, without worrying, because the worrying ruins those times together. In the long run, that will negatively affect your relationship. You can get a new girlfriend. This gal sounds like she has a real princess complex going on. She will drain you of all your affection.

        "a": "Anybody who thinks he KNOWS what the future holds, in terms of which technologies will be the most dominant knows a lot less than he thinks he does. Some people think the energy cost of using hydrogen as fuel is too high, and that therefore batteries will dominate. They reason that by using electricity directly to charge a battery, you use a lot less energy in total to move a car, etc. This is a good argument, but it\u2019s not watertight. The electricity needed to manufacture hydrogen ( separate it from other elements chemically and purify it for use as fuel ) may get to be cheap enough that the cost of it hardly matters. The people who believe in THIS scenario believe wind and solar electricity will eventually get to be dirt cheap you see. Other people believe the very expensive materials such as platinum used as catalysts in fuel cells are in such short supply and so expensive that fuel cells will never be built by the tens of millions. It\u2019s rather likely that platinum will always be very costly, but the people who are experimenting with fuel cells have already discovered several other substitutes that work well enough to be practical, and that will cost far less. And the actual cost of building fuel cells might eventually fall to the point that they are CHEAPER than batteries. It\u2019s true that batteries are getting cheaper these days, but stop and think about WHY. The raw materials aren\u2019t getting cheaper. Batteries are getting cheaper because as the industry grows up, as it scales up, the people doing the work are constantly discovering new ways to lower the cost of every single step in the job of manufacturing a battery, plus new designs are cheaper to manufacture and use less materials per unit of capacity. This same continuous process of lowering the cost of production applies to fuel cells as well. Some future day, fuel cells may be CHEAPER to build than batteries, and they may last longer, and be more reliable. But for what it\u2019s worth, my guess is that batteries will dominate in the electric vehicle market for quite some time, especially in the light car and truck markets. I think this is a safe bet because even if fuel cells do get to be cheaper than batteries, there isn\u2019t any infrastructure in place to distribute and sell hydrogen to the owners of cars and trucks, whereas the electric grid extends to even the smallest backwoods communities these days in modern countries. Upgrading the grid to charge millions of cars will be an expensive undertaking, but the electric company will be glad to spend the money, because you spend money to make money, lol. Supplying hydrogen at just one or two locations where the same vehicles can be refueled on a daily basis is easier, so if a city wants to use fuel cell buses, that city can put in just a small handful of hydrogen fueling stations to serve it\u2019s entire bus fleet. That\u2019s not so hard, and not so expensive as to be impractical. Is hydrogen the fuel of the future? Is metallic hydrogen going to be the fuel source of the future? How can the energy of hydrogen be harnessed? How safe will hydrogen gas be as a future fuel? Will selling hydrogen fuel be a good business in the future? It's not. Not at all. Where did you learn it was? It takes more electricity to produce the hydrogen required to drive 20 miles, than it takes to drive 20 miles in a 21st century EV. So why use the electricity to create hydrogen fuel? Just put it in a battery and drive. I know of no reliable knowledgeable sources that still advocate for hydrogen. All of the car makers have abandoned the efforts as far as I know. The one real moon shot car was the Mirai and there are now over 1,200 sold in the U.S. I think there were more DOT approved hovercrafts sold than Mirais The electricity required to produce the fuel is the technology's fatal flaw. I personally don\u2019t see hydrogen replacing all electric. The all electric car is just too convenient. You get up in the morning and you\u2019ve got a full charge and are ready to go. Beware, though, it will take time. The current electric grid infrastructure is woefully inadequate to support major turnover to all electric cars. However, the hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle still has it\u2019s place. For me it works better than all electric because I frequently need to drive long distances, and a 60 - 90 minute charge time just won\u2019t cut it (the longest time it has taken to fill my Clarity with hydrogen was 4 minutes 10 seconds). For buses, I think fuel cells might have a lock. They have lots of cheap real estate on top for (low cost) medium pressure storage tanks, and the near absence of maintenance is a huge selling point for the jurisdictions that have them. The up front cost has also fallen precipitously. Warehouse forklifts are another application where I think fuel cells will displace batteries to a great extent. There will be applications where the battery electric still makes the most sense, but we are seeing large warehouse operators making wholesale shifts from battery to fuel cell (Amazon, for example). Likewise, the indoor \u201cgolf cart\u201d vehicles you see around airports, hospitals, etc. might eventually be displaced by hydrogen. I\u2019m frequently in discussions with many of the major automakers, as well as technology developers, end users (consumer and institutional), infrastructure developers and operators, and others. It\u2019s still a shifting landscape, but it seems clear that there is not going to be a single winner. The benefits of diversity are just too great. Presently hydrogen is inefficient to generate, and there are issues with hydrogen fuel cells in cold weather. Fuel cells rely on expensive rare elements. In contrast the cost of batteries continues to drop. Unless there is some breakthrough, hydrogen isn\u2019t the fuel of the future. Hydrogen is not the future of fuel and energy. The future of fuel is a truly magnificent one and it is called renewable energy which coupled with utility sized battery storage will supply mankind with all of its energy needs. Do I need to say more?",

If he was doing it then, he probably does it regularly. Which is disrespectful to your relationship with her and to you. When you tried to tell her far more nicely than you should have, she had a meltdown and got angry. Not only did she get angry, but she yelled at you. She got defensive. Not only did she yell at you, she stormed out of dinner like a baby. See #2. Instead of telling her that he was being completely inappropriate, you took a tactful approach where you told her he may have bad intentions and she shouldn't let him push that far. It's true, but her willingness to let him behave that way is disrespectful to you. She needs to stop him and remind him that she's taken. I bet that if some female flirted with you, she wouldn't be nearly as polite and tentative as you were. I'd suggest you discuss her behavior with her. The flirting isn't ok. Storming out of dinner isn't ok. If she wants to behave that way, you can find a girl who will treat you better. Easily. I am deeply in love with my boyfriend, but I have cheated on him twice with this other guy and haven't told him. We are all friends. What shou... My girlfriend keeps on talking about other guys all the time. I feel jealous. What to do? My girlfriend calls other guys hot, and it makes me jealous. How do I deal with my jealousy? My girlfriend talks about how hot other guys are in front of me. Is it normal to get jealous? How can I fix it? Why do I get jealous if my girl talks to other boys? It seems to me there are two things here. First, your question about how to deal with jealousy. Second, the way your girlfriend talks to other boys. The psychologists say that jealousy is the emotional reaction to lack of self-confidence. I doubted this for a while, but it became clear that it is correct. So, obviously, the way to deal with jealousy is to do whatever is necessary to increase your self-confidence. (How is a further question.) Having said that, I don\u2019t think your problem is limited to jealousy. Your deeper problem is that any woman who reacts the way you describe doesn\u2019t care very much for you. I think you should have enough self-confidence to tell her that if she likes flirting with other boys on chat or in person or in any other way, you will find someone else who really does care for you. The \u2018green-eyed monster\u2019 jealousy should be avoided. It is truly dangerous - killed Desdemona. It does not follow that you should accept just any behavior from a woman you care for. Stand up for yourself and you won\u2019t have jealousy issues. If she doesn\u2019t meet your standards, then leave. I can tell you, she would do the same. Its one thing to be deeply in love with her, but is she deeply in love with you? Nobody here knows but you. Insecurity can be provoked, anxiety can be provoked and negative self talk, self blame and depression can be provoked if you remain in an unbalanced relationship, let alone an unhealthy one. By walking away from the dinner table, she has demonstrated a failure in communication and a lack of respect, also dismissive and avoidant. Now, may be you have been overtly clingy, and needy, may be you have been suspicious and are constantly prying into her life. Whether her behavior triggered you or your behavior triggered her is the central tenet of this issue, because you have described just a one of incident in your relationship, how were the both of you prior to this? Was this a first time incident? or has similar incidents happened before? What are your relationship rules? Every relationship has unspoken \u201crules\u201d. This incident definitely reflects disharmony and your relationship will undoubtedly head south if the both of you do not resolve issues, i repeat, the both of you. I don't think you are wrong. If someday she finds you ever chatting with other girls, ask her, what will be her reaction? \u201cYou won't decide, what should I do\u201d, Can she accept this sentence from you? Will she say sorry to you instantly? Will she like you flirting with other girls? If the answers for the above questions are\u201c yes\", then only you can think of dealing with your jealousy, otherwise you are fine. I mean, that is how possessive we all are,when we are in love.",

Thus, if we assume that this area was permanently\u200b covered with ice, it would have made ice to be much thicker in the interior of Antarctica. Thus Antarctica would have played much bigger role in controlling earth's environment. Of course, humans would hv discovered it much earlier . Also, the oasis regions situated at the periphery would have been much larger and very comfortable to live even on permanent basis. How much land has melted away in Antarctica? Is it possible to buy/own land in Antarctica? Can anyone claim land in Antarctica if they get there? What is the total area of Antarctica? How does a massive cargo plane land on the ice of Antarctica? What does the runway composed of? Is it only ice? How was it made? Generally speaking; for the continent to double in size, that even with global warming is still already a large mass ice; the weather pattern of the Earth would be altered in such a huge way that it is nearly impossible to speculate how history would have turned out. Given that weather does not change quickly on such a large scale; and assuming that Antarctica had been this size for many thousands of years, the weather patters would be so different that the specific requirements that led to Human kind to dominating the Earth might not have happened. It is always fun, yet impossible to speculate on such drastic events. But knowing the simple mass difference in weather, the impact on world history would likely be so drastic that many of the communities that went on to from countries that we have in the world today would simply not exist. Migration patters of people would be different and many people would build cities in different areas. For Antarctica to be this big, the world itself would need to be colder. A lot colder.

(details follow) So take 0xFFFF and add one (because we started at zero) and get 0x10000 which is 65,536 decimal. Now divide by 1,024 (1Kb) and you get 64.",

        "a": "No it isn\u2019t. If you don\u2019t care about others, and if you find it so easy to say you don\u2019t care about them, then this (and partifularly your question) suggests that your social skills will indeed be very poor. Why is this? To have good social skills, you need to (a) give a damn about people, and (b) be able to build a bond with others. In your future place of work you need to be able to do build a bond with people  genuinely , that is to say a relationship, in which you have forged a connection that enables you both to flourish and find win-win situations on a continual basis. It is reasonable to assume you won\u2019t like everyone that you meet, so yes, you will need to be able to do this authentically and not faking it, even with them. To be a good rapport-builder you have to be able to do this. If you fail to master this, you will be marked up as a bad or poor communicator or as a destructive presence in a team. No-one wants someone like that on their team because it means they have to carry the can for you and continually repair the damage you will be doing to internal and possibly also external relationships. The result? - People will give you bad performance reviews; promotions will be given to others; and people will not want to be with you socially either. You will become increasingly isolated because guess what - if you don\u2019t care about others, why would they want to care about you? So, in summary, you need A (to care) in order to be able to do B (build bonds) in order to have social skills, and as you clearly don\u2019t have A, this means you can\u2019t do B. When it comes to how little you care, it is of course your choice, but know this: people will know you are judging them, even if you are not saying it. Only 7% of what we communicate to others is verbal. The rest is non-verbal, and so consists of body language, looks, facial expressions and so on. What you think and don\u2019t say is like a perfume (if it is pleasant) or stink (if not) that you give off. People can easily sense your judgements and lack of caring about them, even if they are unspoken. This will predispose them against you, and others may not particularly like what you are doing either so they will avoid you and your indifferent attitude to others like the plague. I will let you work out whether in the light of these things, feigning interest in others is a good idea. Do YOU like fake people? How can I stop worrying about what other people think? Why do some people care a lot about leg room while others don't? What is the one thing you don't care about and are tired of hearing about? Why don't my parents seem to care about my lack of social skills? What are things you care about but most people don't? Is social skills all about feigning interest in others who you don\u2019t care about? At the end of the day, I don\u2019t really care if my classmate or librarian lives or die. a2a: You\u2019re mistaking and mismatching apathy with social skills. Ability to be social is the ability to respect, be kind and be able to carry a conversation regardless of whether you care about the person with whom you\u2019re socializing. To illustrate, I can\u2019t respect people who have little manners (not withstanding understandable and forgivable cultural differences); an example of this is people who cut me off in a heavy traffic and weaving in-and-out, endangering everyone. But when I don\u2019t curse him out regardless of whether he can hear me\u2014that\u2019s respect and a social skill. Another example, sometimes I want to be alone at church, but still want to go to church. Occasionally, someone would approach me to ask me for questions or advise. I entertain their questions and guide them\u2014not by giving them my opinions but by asking them questions and letting them talk through it (not unlike a talk-therapy) even though I have little interest in what they say. That\u2019s respect, kindness and ability to carry a conversation (though I\u2019m not the one talking much in that case). That\u2019s an example of social skills. Now at some point of the \u201crelationship\u201d you might or might not grow some care about that same person. But that really bears little, if none, to do with \u201cpathy\u201d whether apathy, antipathy, sympathy or empathy. To use a terrible illustration: some of the worst serial killers, predators or otherwise horrible criminals in history use their social skills to lure unsuspecting victims into their clutches. That said and additional answer as a slight tangent, at least you\u2019re honest about your apathy on the lives of your classmate or librarian. There\u2019s nothing about it that is or isn\u2019t acceptable, only that if you do want it to change one day and to grow a positive \u201cpathy\u201d the first step of it is by honing some sort of social skills so that you are able to better \u201cvirtually try to walk using the other person\u2019s shoes\u201d. Not all about that. But \u2018feigning\u2019 is a definite social skill. In order to be polite or appropriate, one must often feign interest in a boring topic or discussion. One must often feign various types of body language and expressions, e.g, smiling, nodding, posturing, etc. Social convention and the rules of polite society require that we do this. Basically, we are forced to be very effective and persuasive social actors. Because if we decided to not play along and instead decided to broadcast our true thoughts, feelings, and urges all the time, then polite society would quickly crumble. We have to \u2018feign\u2019 often in order to survive. Which means basically that we have to play pretend on a routine basis in order to peacefully co-exist with the rest of society. Not really, it just easier to block out others than feel for them. Indifference is the absence of love. Love requires effort and personal interest. Indifference requires nothing. Feeling nothing\u2026 for anybody. It\u2019s not a social skill.",

I think he had made about thirty films or so. Because he'd done it in his time off and used a stage name, there was some controversy. The clincher though was that in his contract with the US government, there was a clause which prevented him from moonlighting without explicit permission from his CO. Basically, this clause meant that he could wait tables at a diner but that he was supposed to clear it with his boss first. He didn't do that, and got busted. Using this as a precedent, if one got explicit written permission from a CO and it didn't interfere with his duties\u2026 then maybe he could. But good luck getting an officer to sign off on that. I don't remember seeing a follow-up on the story. Edit: So, I decided to Google the story. My memory served pretty well, except he only made 29 movies.

It helps to tell people you are quitting to make yourself stick to your goal. It also helps them understand when you are a bit more irritable than normal. Cigarette smoking causes an honest-to-goodness addiction. I smoked when I was young and was able to quit though a program. I thought the first 72 hours were the worse. It is really hard when people smoke around when you are quitting or just quit. After a while, if all goes well, you might even be irritated by the smell of cigarette smoke. I went to a free class that met at the hospital to quit. Here is a site that may have tips and provides a telephone where you can get real-live counseling from a person. Anti-smoking websites & Master index of anti-tobacco links Here is a online program that was developed in cooperation with the Mayo Clinic: Become An EX Smoker, Learn to Quit Smoking, Stop Smoking Cigarettes Good luck. Will smoking weed help me to quit smoking cigarettes? Is it too late for me to quit smoking again? How can I quit smoking if cigarette is not just like drugs for me, but also motivational process? I'm going to break up with my boyfriend because he started smoking cigarettes and lied to me for a month. He doesn't want to quit smoking; he ... Why do my parents smoke weed? How can I tell them to stop? I\u2019m not sure what you would expect your parents to do about it. Quitting has to be YOUR decision and YOUR effort. Obviously, your parents aren\u2019t doing anything to enable it, since you admit that they don\u2019t even know you\u2019re smoking. So what is it that you would want them to do to \u201csupport\u201d your efforts? Depends on your parents. Mine would overreact and try to support me in very unsupportive manner. I'd probably want to smoke after they try to \u201csupport me\". So if your parents don't seem to be the best people to support you, see if you can contact an AA counselor or a group online to find support groups dealing with quitting smoking in the absence of people who can support you. If they are the supportive type, go ahead. You probably know how your parents would react better than random people in a forum. You are 20 years old, you are no longer a child. I think they would be pleased that you were able to ask them for help, and pleased that you are reaching out to them for help to stop doing something they (I\u2019m guessing) disagree with. I would say go for it, 9 times out of 10 honestly is the best policy. If they have said something along the lines of \u2018As long you live in our house, you will not be allowed to smoke.\u2019 Then get in there before they can bring it up and say that you know they disapprove of it and you are trying to combat it and that you just need some support so you can kick the habit. Whatever happens, I wish you the best of luck!",

        "a": "As for the tan - use peelings once a week and rub the most tan places more thoroughly than all the others. You should also use strong sunblock (SPF 50 and higher) on those darker areas leaving the rest of the skin unprotected for a couple of weeks - apply the sunblok every day, even on cloudy days. And find at least one day to lay in the sun for a couple of hour in the afternoon wearing strong sunblok only on already very tan places so that the rest of the skin gets darker and evens out the differences. As for the legs - shave them, that\u2019s the only painfree option for hair removal. And don\u2019t forget to apply body lotion after shaving to prevent skin irritation and dryness. Eyebrows: watch some youtube videos on the subject, there are many there that explain how to do it yourself, if you spend enough time searching zou will find the one that answers all zour questions. Hair: to keep dandruff under control you need to use a special shampoo, you\u2019d better go to a drug store and get one there, the ones you can get at a supermarket are mostly designed for very mild cases. You should also change your pillocases once a week and wash them at 90 degrees Celsius to kill all the fungus off, wash your hairbrush several times a week with hot water and anti-dandruff shampoo. Once you have defeated dandruff your hair will probably stop falling out so much, but in case it doesn\u2019t try cleaning up your diet, taking supplements with vitamins A ans E and Calcium and try some hair masks to strengthen the hair roots, you can even make some yourself - the internet is full of recipes, the ones I found the most effective contain colourless henna powder, milk and raw eggs. As for the pimples try special facials with salt and mud once a week, use special day and night creams that are supposed to lessen acne, and if ill this doesn\u2019t help and acne gets really bad, go to your OBGYN and get a prescription for a birth control pill - those pills, especially the ones containing the hormone cyproteronacetate, clean up the skin better than anything else, because if creams and masks don\u2019t work the cause of your acne is most likely hormonal and there is no other way of balancing your hormones than to take artificial ones. How do I make my skin glow without going to a beauty parlour? Do women really care about skin color when it comes to male beauty? What are the best home skin care remedies? Who can help me restore my lips to their natural color, a doctor or beauty/skin care dermatologist? Where do I go for skin care in Dubai? Use sunblock. It will help. Buy a tweezers, tweeze from underneath. Go to the drugstore and buy a regimen suitable for your skin type. Buy a razor and shave your legs. Buy Head & Shoulders shampoo for your dandruff. Losing hair is genetic. A dermatologist has effective medication for that. No home remedies encourage new growth or stop hair loss. It\u2019s possible that it\u2019s an endocrine issue. For hairy legs use Razor or any shaving tool with a good shower gel. For eyebrows you need to use a plucking tool . You can refer to youtube .Millions of videos are there. Use egg white . Apply it directly on the affected area and leave it till it gets dry. Peel it of . The black dots will be removed along with that. Use Himalaya fairness face wash daily twice or thrice a day. You can use some home made face packs to get a fairer/less tanned skin tone. 1. Curd and honey. 2. Curd and oatmeal. 3. Lemon juice and gram flour /Oatmeal. 4. Tomato paste and lemon juice/rose water. 5. Baking soda and white vinegar. You need to take 1 table spoon of each ingredients for each pack and need to mix and apply on your face. Leave it for 15- 20 minutes or till it gets dried and wash it off with cold water. Do it daily. For dandruff use Head and Shoulders shampoo everyday .Even I used that and it actually works. Now its completely gone. Drink plenty of water. You can use the mixture of Aloevera gel and curd on your scalp. If you want to regrow your hair you have to use castor oil .Only castor oil can regrow hair. Eat a lot of carrots ,leafy vegetables and sprouts. Eat eggs and nuts/almonds .These helps to maintain healthy hair. Use the mixture of castor oil, olive oil and vitamin E capsule every night while going to bed. Make it lukewarm and Apply only on scalp with a cotton ball. Massage it gently. This will keep you calm and relaxed and help to increase blood circulation. Leave it overnight and wash your hair in the morning. Follow it for a month. You will regain your hair. hope that helps.",

So I am going to answer if on how to know if you are slow thinker. What is a slow thinker? Most people are not XIO thinkers. It\u2019s not because of their brain but because of their  brain software . Many people are slow thinkers, not because they are short on brainpower, but because they\u2019re using very sluggish, outdated brain software that favours only the left half of their brain. The \u2018thinking software\u2019 they were taught to think with slows them down. It\u2019s inside-the-box thinking. How fast can you think? Answer these five questions: - In any situation can you instantly know how you feel about it? YES NO -\u00c2 When criticised can you quickly defend your opinions? YES NO -\u00c2 Is it easy for you to see the logical errors in the thinking of others? YES NO -\u00c2 Are you good at convincing others when your point-of-view is right? YES NO -\u00c2 When faced with a decision can you quickly see the obvious alternatives and choose the best one? YES NO If you answered YES to any of these questions then chances are your thinking is much slower than it need be and you can easily double your speed of thought. What\u2019s the problem here? It\u2019s the 2500-year-old left-brained Greco-Roman software \u2013  logic  \u2013 which was spread around the world via the European education system during the second millennium and is so sluggish. It\u2019s black hat thinking. Many people are still stuck with logic, based on the  I-am-right-and-you-are-wrong  method, so that\u2019s as fast as they can go. Why is logic so slow? Starting from the conflict-based  I-am-right-and-you-are-wrong  premise logic traps the thinker into defending his viewpoint against any suggestion of change (because \u201cI-am-right!\u201d). It becomes difficult, even impossible, for the thinker to  escape  from his own point-of-view. To think outside-the-square. Programmed into your brain by the education system\u00c2 logic was designed by the Roman church for Europe and then spread around the world by missionaries. It was imported into Australia, along with rabbits, 200 years ago. Designed to defend \u2018truth\u2019 logic is driven by judgment.\u00c2 Once the thinker judges something as either \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 their enormous brainpower is then devoted to defending that opinion. This makes it very difficult for the thinker to escape from his opinion to find a much better one. Arguments are tedious and drawn-out. Change is slow, protracted and time-consuming. That may have been OK for Europe in the middle ages but it\u2019s not OK for Australia in the new millennium. In today\u2019s world the imperative is velocity. We need to be speed thinkers. What benefits you can expect from being a Speed Thinker? Pump up  both  sides of your brain. Your brain is a powerful machine. Like a Formula One racing car, it\u2019s more efficient at higher speeds. There are many benefits from accelerating your speed of thought. The faster you read, for example, the higher your comprehension because your brain is operating more efficiently at the faster speed. The same applies to your speed of thought. The faster you think, the higher the quality of your decision-making. Also, by doubling your speed of thought you will: - Be more open-minded. - Be able to see more opportunities. - Be better at solving problems. - Enjoy making better and faster decisions. - Be more effective at planning. - Get much better results. - Find it easier to be creative. - Be able to take advantage of changes in circumstances. - Get things done. - Think more efficiently and worry less. - Own a basis for a higher communication with others. - See information in new and more useful ways. - Learn the skill of XIO THINKING. -Generate better and better alternatives. - Raise the level of every other thought-based skill you possess. - Apply these new skills to your personal and family life. - Be more productive with business and work problems and opportunities. - You will be an XIO Thinker!",

Specifically, GR has defied all attempts at  Renormalization - Wikipedia  . There are two approaches to solve this:  Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia  and  String theory - Wikipedia  Neither seems close to being verified. What's a cool math fact you can easily tell a layman and look super cool? How is game theory related to quantum mechanics? How can I explain Einstein's theory of relativity in simple terms to a friend? Do we need to develop a new type of math to combine quantum mechanics and general relativity? What is quantum mechanics? You can\u2019t combine them. Einsteinians may try to convince you that special relativity and quantum mechanics are successfully combined in quantum field theory but this is a red herring. And you cannot combine them because you cannot reconcile Einstein's absurd relative time (a consequence of Einstein's false constant-speed-of-light postulate) and Newton's absolute time: https://www.quantamagazine.org/2...   \u00a0\"The effort to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity means reconciling totally different notions of time. In quantum mechanics, time is universal and absolute; its steady ticks dictate the evolving entanglements between particles. But in general relativity (Albert Einstein's theory of gravity), time is relative and dynamical, a dimension that's inextricably interwoven with directions X, Y and Z into a four-dimensional \"space-time\" fabric.\" https://www.newscientist.com/art...   \u00a0\"In quantum theory, a \"master clock\" ticks away somewhere in the universe, measuring out all processes. But in Einstein's relativity, time is distorted by motion and gravity, so clocks don't necessarily agree on how it is passing - meaning any master clock must, somewhat implausibly, be outside the universe.\" https://www.perimeterinstitute.c...   \u00a0Perimeter Institute: \"Quantum mechanics has one thing, time, which is absolute. But general relativity tells us that space and time are both dynamical so there is a big contradiction there. So the question is, can quantum gravity be formulated in a context where quantum mechanics still has absolute time?\" http://science.sciencemag.org/co...   \u00a0\"In Einstein's general theory of relativity, time depends locally on gravity; in standard quantum theory, time is global \u2013 all clocks \"tick\" uniformly.\" http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/06100...   \u00a0\"One one hand, time in quantum mechanics is a Newtonian time, i.e., an absolute time. In fact, the two main methods of quantization, namely, canonical quantization method due to Dirac and Feynman's path integral method are based on classical constraints which become operators annihilating the physical states, and on the sum over all possible classical trajectories, respectively. Therefore, both quantization methods rely on the Newton global and absolute time. [...] The transition to (special) relativistic quantum field theories can be realized by replacing the unique absolute Newtonian time by a set of timelike parameters associated to the naturally distinguished family of relativistic inertial frames.\" http://www.hindawi.com/journals/...   \u00a0\"In quantum mechanics, time is absolute. The parameter occurring in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation has been directly inherited from Newtonian mechanics and is not turned into an operator. In quantum field theory, time by itself is no longer absolute, but the four-dimensional spacetime is; it constitutes the fixed background structure on which the dynamical fields act. GR is of a very different nature. According to the Einstein equations (2), spacetime is dynamical, acting in a complicated manner with energy momentum of matter and with itself. The concepts of time (spacetime) in quantum theory and GR are thus drastically different and cannot both be fundamentally true.\" Pentcho Valev Modify quantum mechanics and/or relativity to make them combinable? Seriously, there is nothing simple about this. Scientists have been trying to combine these theories for more than 100 years now and have not succeeded so far.",

In our day-to-day lives, anyone who speaks in such a lawyerly manner is likely doing so because they are trying to get away with something; in her case, it's just because she has so many people trying to take her down.

Smart people who found they\u2019ve lied for something that is doing no one good (they didn\u2019t lie to save lives) will admit the lie. Smart people will admit to being wrong in the past and smart people will tell you that they will TRY to do better. Dumb people think that trying isn\u2019t good enough. You have to be perfect. They have unreasonable expectations that someone in a tough position should never doubt or fail or know when it is appropriate to lie to people. Real idiots vote for someone like Trump - a proven liar who never apologizes for anything because, in his addled brain, he is never wrong. No one is never wrong. If you can\u2019t recognize that, you have no business in a tough position.

Will divide the sections here namely verbal ability, quantitative aptitude and reasoning and outline the guidelines accordingly. Verbal ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC) Since last two three years, RC is the major lookout here because of its major chunk. 22\u201324 questions on RC out of 34. Primary focus should be mastery over RC. RC can be mastered if you have the key to crack this nut i.e READING. Read various newspapers, novels, blogs, magazines , articles and so on. Focus on vocabulary too since some exams like SNAP, NMAT , IIFT give straight questions on vocabulary. Refer Norman Lewis book, Wilfred funk , Magoosh flash cards app, Wordpandit vocabulary app etc. READING SOURCES are Arts & Letters Daily  ,  Daily Reads-2017 - Wordpandit  ,  Aeon | a world of ideas  , apart from daily newspapers. For TEST PREP SOLVING RC TIPS Ideal Test Simulator For The RC Section Found On All Standard Tests. https://cat.wordpandit.com/cat-e... https://cat.wordpandit.com/cat-r... https://cat.wordpandit.com/readi... https://cat.wordpandit.com/4-tip... https://cat.wordpandit.com/how-to-start-your-preparation-for-the-cat-verbal-ability-section tip : 1. Practise 4\u20135 RC\u2019s a day at a stretch so as to develop stamina and maintain your concentration on a particular section. Solve 1000 GMAT rc if time permits. 2. Focus on words like all, some,many,not , few, little etc while solving VARC. Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR) 32 questions here with almost 4\u20135 questions per set. For this section , much practise would be required. Prepare from TIME modules on Logical reasoning part. Take up arun sharma or Nishit Sinha for DI. Apart from this, Practise past AIMCATs and SIMCATs DI/LR from 2015 and 2016 mocks. Tip : Get acquainted with some better representations of circular arrangements, tables, criss -cross pattern solving , direction sense and so on. Focus on accuracy and selection rather than no. of attempts. 3. Focus while reading set so as to interpret correct. for eg. immediate left or left, extreme right or right etc. Quantitative Aptitude ( QA) Focus here on basics only. More and more sharpening of basics will fetch you good percentiles. Take up any institute\u2019s material for this section and practise on selection, speed and accuracy. Also refer Takshila shikshak videos on youtube for conceptual framework. Give more and more sectional tests here to analyze your strengths and weaknesses. tip : Just know what all topics you like and are good at. convert them into strengths and know them inside out. Focus on selection and have a rounds approach of solving easy then moderate and then difficult question. Do not waste time on a single question and move on if not able to solve in limited time. Apart from solving and testing part, take a good test series which has national level parameters on your performance. Ideally , TIME or IMS will be good to go with. CL is also great. Take up any and analyze mocks on a regular basis rather than giving more mocks. ATB I am a first year student. What are the ways of starting preparations for the CAT for the 2017-18 session? Should I give CAT again? I have given it twice without prep (As was working crazy hours) and have got 97.1 and 99.56 in 2015 and 2016 respecti... Is it okay to start preparing for the CAT in the month of June? I am new to UPSC preparation. How do I start preparing for Prelims 2017 from now? Now I am a 1st year BTech student in Chennai. What time should I start preparation for CAT? If you have an above average aptitude and have studied diligently in your school time, the time is sufficient. I am citing these 2 reasons because at the end of the day, CAT is an aptitude test. Aptitude is built over a period of time and not in a very short span of time. Provided you have good aptitude, the time is enough to brush up and build over it so that you can apply it faster and with more accuracy. School time is very important from CAT\u2019s perspective, because the foundation is being built there only. Your concepts of maths, reasoning etc are built in that time. So if you were a diligent student who was more interested in concepts rather than cramming, you have enough time to revise and apply them. I have answered a lot of other questions as well regarding CAT preparation and strategy. Please go through them. I hope that helps you. All the best..:) Yes Nishita i think there is no need to be worried about that you are starting too late for exam as six month tenure is sufficient for the preparation of cat exam, what you need to do is to make a strict time table for yourself and follow it intensely and inspite of all this make your own strategy by giving 2\u20133 mocks and plan your preparation in accordance with that. Yes it is sufficient enough if you work for it.

Here, you are not even sure it was done by Russia, so proving it was a conspiracy is near impossible. You had an insider turn states evidence in Watergate. No insider with testimony has appeared. Watergate was a criminal act from the discovery of the breakin. In Trump's case, we arent even sure a crime was committed. If it was done by a trusted insider, it may not have any connection, and may not even be a crime. And most of Wikileaks are by trusted insiders, not state actors. Without a crime, you have no criminal conspiracy. Is a comparison between Trump and Nixon fair? Why are people comparing Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler? What do you think about Trump firing James Comey? Why are so many people asking questions about why President Trump fired the FBI's James Comey? How did James Comey get fired by Trump? Thanks for the A2A! In my personal opinion there is too much wishful thinking by Clinton supporters (like me). Watergate was a massive, well known and understood scandal that almost no politician could defend. Trumps actions are not nearly as universally despised, in part because many Republicans are focused on fighting specific Democrat policies and not on the broader picture. I think the biggest contrast is the universality of Watergate verse Trumps Scandals which lack that. Jill Wine-Banks who was the Assistant Watergate Special Prosecutor along with former prosecutor Paul Butler share opinion on insight from Comey memo. The comparison with Watergate is fully obvious, yet uniquely challenging at the same time. Trump\u2019s Impeachment? Many of us say, hasn't there been enough wrong doing from the start that would have merited some sort of consequence? What will it take? More than what Nixon or Bill Clinton did? Though I believe Nixon was more intelligent and patriotic than Trump, the mindset of the people is different at this time, and Trump is quite skilled at creating diversions away from his unethical behaviors. Trump is more likely to have pre-planned his con and marketed his power to be unquestioned, from the start. Trump has divulged info that should have been secure, and he has impeded investigations that were key to lawful governing, and did so in a corrupt way from all appearances or common sense. It is \u201cDamning Evidence\u201d, yet don\u2019t underestimate the ability of White Collar criminals in power, to know how much they can cross the line without repercussion. The Russia private meetings, that were not intended to be featured in the news, slipped and gave us another puzzle piece to the collusion that is is likely the residue of the deep rooted covert action that we are unlikely to see the full evidence. (Eg. Many people are willing to overlook the funds paid to Trump via Russia that are minimized by White House) IMO this is worse than Watergate, because we are confused by information and misinformation overload, and now numb to lies. There are definite comparisons: 1) Suspicion of a crime involving the president 2) Cover ups abound 3) Investigation 4) More push back and cover ups We are just into stage 3 with Trump and his cohorts. And 4 is gushing in like Noah's flood. Other than that, no comparison. The motives seem the same, both for the theft of information and the obstruction of justice by inappropriate firing. Trump should be flattered by the comparison. Nixon may have been a crook, but he was also a patriot and a way more intelligent man than Trump.",

Every faculty associated with GBO has excelled in his/her field. someone has written 5 books on Economics. Another is a double P.hd and working on his 3rd P.hd. Someone did a 6 month course from HARVARD. A retired ARMY COLONEL takes lectures on Communication and International trade. The Principal himself takes classes on Financial Management.

The information related to exam dates and the application process can be found at the college website. It provides a diploma in global business but the college authorities have already applied for a permission to run a proper MBA course on the lines of IIMs which will be able to award a degree.

It\u2019s in the absolute interest of such institutions to gather intelligence about ISIS as much as possible and no stones will be left unturned. If it turns out some ISIS members on Quora are actually based somewhere in Syria or Iraq, then the possibility of their approximate location being pinpointed and struck with an airstrike or two shouldn\u2019t be ruled out either. Quite honestly, ISIS members using Quora might even be a \u2018gold mine\u2019 for Western, Syrian and Iraqi intelligence agencies, as they can promptly investigate and arrest individuals planning attacks or moving throughout Europe or the Middle East. I\u2019m also going to go my way to say that the problem with  Suhas Hoysala \u2019s comparison with ISIS to neo-Nazis, homophobes, white supremacists etc. is that ISIS is actually a  terrorist group that is at war against numerous countries as of now. Name me one group of neo-Nazis, white supremacists or homophobes (especially ones at Quora) that are doing the same thing. Last I checked, these kinds of people tend to not last very long here anyway, given how left-leaning Quora is in general. It is actually a massive threat, especially to Western Europe, Iraq, Syria and Russia. They are an extremely dangerous group that have slaughtered tens of thousands of people and to think one can \u2018change\u2019 them into a more \u2018peaceful path\u2019 is outright silly, naive and delusional. Play stupid games, you win stupid prizes. You don\u2019t win wars by being nice to the enemy.

Is there any person from ISIS using Quora? Do people use Quora in Britain? How many people use Quora? Why does Quora allow people to fly the ISIS flag on this site? When people from new areas start using Quora, we can expect a whole new set of questions. \u201cGot 5 followers today. Maybe because of the latest beheading video I wrote about.\u201d How can I join the Jihadi Training Institute in Raqqa? What are some tips to hack someone's life? I said that an AK47 is better than AK57. My buddy disagrees. How should I kill him? What guns did Al-Baghdadi play with during his childhood? How can I feature in the next execution video? What happened to Jihadi John? My friend is advising me to use a new weapon. Should I trust him? What are some mind blowing car bomb techniques? My 15th wife fights well. Where should I post her? A colleague of mine just waved at me. Is he going to kill me? Al Baghdadi : What is your view on car bombs? Did Obama say, \u201cA drone a day keeps the Jihad away? Will add more as I feed my imagination. Cheers! Honestly, if ISIS militants could use a medium where rational thought and educated discussion were promoted, I would be happy. The only harm they could do here is post offensive content, and then that would get them banned for BNBR violations. Perhaps reading why their harmful, disgusting ideology is so horrendous could convince them to move past their hatred toward unity and tolerance. There are many neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and homophobes here on Quora. If ISIS were to join these groups (or, more likely, trolls) by communicating their hateful rhetoric, they could perhaps take any criticism to their views to heart and move toward a more peaceful path.

        "a": "The school I studied is a more traditional  school. So ,they gave more importance to yoga and meditation.I studied in that school from my 1st grade to 4th grade. So usually our classes will start at 9am followed by a prayer. Then there will be two classes upto 11am. After that we'll go to ground where each section have separate place for  Gardening.  In that hour we should maintain the garden and take the grown vegetables. Every week the vegetables are given to one student. We are not supposed to call our teachers as teachers. We are supposed to call them as sisters and brothers and each section is like a family. After gardening the lunch will start around 12.30am. After that games period and slogam class. The meditation is at 2pm to 3pm. After that yoga,untill 4pm. As a kid I always liked meditation. So every day during yoga class the instructor will say steps like 1 in which we'll sit in padmasana and the step continues. And every day after sitting in padmasana and closing my eyes I would never hear anything. And I would become conscious during the 6th or 7th step.This happened for a week. The next week in the yoga class , after sitting in padmasana and closing my eyes the same happened except for this time that I had gone for two and a half hours. The yoga instructor tried to wake me up but I didn't . Then finally I became conscious at 5.30pm. I didn't realise what happened and I searched for my friend. But what I saw is our correspondent sitting next to me. Then he said it's getting late let's leave. I got confused. Then he dropped me home in his car. Our correspondent is a very divine person(we call him ji) . It's a more traditional school that in temples our school students will be singing bajanas . The reason I like the school very much is that they completely taught us about Ramayana ,Mahabharata within our 4th grade and our teachers will advice us to act according to dharmam. For them education is the last preference. They got us involved in sports and other creative activities. But I never indulged in meditation like that again as i stopped closing my eyes during yoga classes. And I left for another school in my fifth grade as we shifted to a different place. Thank you.",

        "a": "This is a very delicate question and requires a smart answer. Love is always powerful than anything on this world, forget about money. But talking about today's perspective where in this new age of comfort and all luxurious life which every single person on this earth wants to live, love has somwhere lost its velocity. Love cannot buy you a luxurious house but money can, love cannot buy you super cars but money can, love cannot get you precious jewels but money can, love cannot get you comfort on super spongy bed but money can, love cannot help you in travelling around the world but money can. You see love almost loses everywhere against money, but love can give you something which you can never buy from money no matter weather you're a billionaire or a trillionaire, love can give you the power of faith, it gives you the power of trust, it gives you the power of emotions which are strong enough to help you getting enormous amount of money you want. So atlast you can say that its a one on one situation where sometimes love loses and sometimes money loses. Hope you find my answer satisfying. \\U0001f609 If you won the lottery, what would you invest in? What is the craziest or most creative (and non-violent) way in which you have gotten back at an ex- for wronging you? Is money needed to win the heart of a girl? Is it OK to love money? Is it OK to fall in love at the age of 19? Money my friend. I might sound ridiculous but that\u2019s the sole truth. People never respect true love. They use other\u2019s feelings and destroy lives. They usually go for the other guy\u2019s money and expect him to buy or complete their desires or wish list by buying them anything. Many destroy their lives believin true love exists.. Thanks to those stupid story writers who write stupid love stories for illogicalling films. That\u2019s why elders always advice us to stay away from love and distractions and concentrate to build their future, live their lives according to their will and earn as much as they can. When a guy achieves the heights if success, a lot of ladies come towards them like magnets. So eventually money wins\u2026 That's an interesting question. I personally feel that money can never give you what love can. Let's see why- So, a tired husband returns from office, his wife and children greet him with a broad smile on their face, that's love. Believe me or not, the thought of that love keeps him going the entire day, and not the amount of money he would receive at the end of the month. Consider the janitor/ driver at your office, who earn just enough to get them going. Ever tried talking to them politely, with a smile? That's something they would love and would probably give them a reason to be happy. Again, that's the magic of love! Ever fallen ill at home? Although money helps you get the medicine, but it's the love and care with which your parents treat you, that helps you recover faster. I am sure each one of us can think of plenty of such instances, where love wins over money! As romantic as it seems to fantasize about living with either of the two, life is almost  never  binary. What I mean is that its  rare  the occasion where one must live with one or the other. Neither  wins  on their own might. You need both, and you should  work/ask  for both. Cheers!",

S/he knows they wronged it is that state of affairs is terribly embarrassing. Could also be a sign of remorse, feeling bad they did betrayed you and not knowing how to ask your forgiveness. Keep your distance. Let him/her come to, then you can talk. If you wish to. Worst case? You may have to pull the plug on the relationship. My ex is getting married in few months. We are separated because she cheated on me for someone rich, I still love her madly. What should I do?... Is my ex mad at me? How do I forget my ex who cheated me? I think my boyfriend is cheating me with his ex , what should I do to know if he's cheating me? How can I be sure my ex didn\u2019t cheat on me? It's called \u201cblameshifting\u201d. Cheaters do this all the time to the person they are betraying. You are in the way of the new person of his/her desires. So they just piss you off so you that YOU\u2019LL act out, and that gives them permission to get angry back at you. It justifies the cheating in their own disordered minds. Cheaters are selfish narcissists. BUT they can't possibly admit that they did something wrong\u2026. they must persist with image management\u2014 meaning, they must present a \u201cgood person\u201d image to the rest of their circle of friends and family. They will make you out to be \u201cangry\u201d, \u201chard to live with\u201d, \u201ccrazy\u201d, even \u201cpsycho\u201d. This maintains to the world that YOU are the bad person, not them. So, accordingly they have to act angry at you to keep the smear campaign going. it depends who broke the relationship. As she cheated I take it you did. she can be angry - not so much with you but with the whole situation. She cheated but she did not get away with it. She didn\u2019t want to break up but she had to. she is displaying emotional immaturity by taking anger out on you. These people are very difficult to relate to because we cannot have an adult conversation with them. It\u2019s all irrational attack. It was the best thing for you that it broke - there would have been no happiness down the line for so many reasons It\u2019s not worth keeping contact. They don\u2019t make good friends either.

I was in a bit of a tough spot and didn't know what to do about suspicions of my husband\u2019s supposed affair until a co-worker recommended a Private Investigator named John to me so I decided to give him a shot at regaining my sanity.

        "a": "I am answering this question off the top of my hat, which is something that I rarely do, and usually regret doing, but\u2026 A Captain, in the context that you seem to be describing, is a misnomer. It is called an honorific, or a title awarded to a class of persons for the work in which they are engaged, a term of respect, if you will. In the military world this is formalized; it is a rank obtained through promotion and in most armed forces except the Navy it is the rank below major. In the Navy it is the rank below Rear Admiral (or Commodore, where that rank exists). On board military ships and submarines, the officer in charge is granted the honorific, but not the rank. In other words, a naval sub-lieutenant xyz could be put in charge of a small minesweeper with a very small crew consisting of a single digit. While he is the \u2018commanding officer\u2019 he is called Captain xyz. After he is transferred to another posting, he would be back as Sub-lieutenant xyz. On board \u2018civilian\u2019 ships, including private yachts, passenger vessels (including ferries), and cargo vessels, the officer in charge is the Master. That is what it says on the official papers, such as the job description, the Watch List, the Crew List and, most importantly, the Certificate of Competency (sometimes called a \u2018license\u2019). Please do not ask me about the \u2018ticket\u2019! He/she is frequently referred to as the Captain, but that is a holdover from the days of sail, when every vessel was armed and able to fight. The officer in command of deciding where the ship is going, what it is going to do and (theoretically) defending the ship in a fight was called the Captain, and it was not a rare event when a teenager would be the Captain. The officer in charge of getting the ship to the place where it is supposed to be going, getting the crew doing what the Captain wanted done and managing the day-to-day routine of running a ship was referred to as the Master, or sometimes the Sailing Master. Now that the boring lecture is over, \u2018Captains\u2019 of merchant ships (I will be using the correct term from here on, in case my head explodes from the internal pressure caused by using that title) became Masters by: Inhaling an enormous amount of book knowledge, several months of experience at sea, and sitting a series of examinations (including the horrendous Oral Examination), in order to become qualified to stand watch as officers in command of a navigational watch; After inhaling even more knowledge, having spent a few years at sea, with a good portion spent in charge of a navigational watch, and another set of exams, Watchkeepers can become Mates, in charge of the other navigation officers, maintaining the vessel\u2019s appearance and deck machinery, and ensuring that the deck crew are at work; and After more knowledge, more sea time, including some time as Mate, and more exams, Mates can, at long last, hold the certificate of Master in their hands. If the sea time was of the right type (far enough from shore, etc.) the certificates can be unlimited. They can serve as Master of any ship anywhere in the world, as long as it is flying the flag of the nation that issued the certificate.  They would be Master Mariners.  However, that doesn't make them automatically a Master of every ship they board, nor does it mean that they will ever sail as Master of any ship. All it does is assure an owner that the person who holds the certificate knows the technical side of the job. As is always the case, the critical aspect of determining whether a specific person can do a set job is personal suitability. People who can do the job effectively have to be natural leaders, with the ability to analyse a situation and determine the best solution very quickly, without consulting a stack of reference books or the computer. That is a skill that cannot be taught. A few years ago I answered a question very similar to this, and I happened to save it for a rainy day. This is that metaphorical day - \u201cIn the microscope management world of today, the concept of Master under God is pretty much done. The same, or possibly more responsibility exists, but the authority has been reduced by ISM and the other equivalent management oversight tools that have been put in place. Many are misused; in fact I am sure that the architects who created ISM would be horrified if they saw the abuses that have been created under that regime. No one can be expected to complete the amount of paperwork that has been created by these regimes and still maintain a reasonable level of oversight, but... It is very difficult to find much common ground for all Masters, given the number of companies, countries and trades involved. They are ultimately responsible, and legally accountable for the ship, everyone and every event that happens on board. The extreme size of the accountability bucket, compared to the frequently minute authority bucket, could make one wonder why anyone would take such a job. The hours of work are atrocious; you can be called at any time and not only be expected but be legally required to perform miracles. Failure is not an option worth considering. It is, in fact, the ultimate challenge for any hero worthy of the name. I have had hundreds of Masters report to me, over the many years that I have managed ships. The vast majority of them are truly heroes. Only seafarers can appreciate the circumstances involved when a Master is called to the wheelhouse in the middle of the night, having only a vague idea of the position of the ship and any nearby coastline, underwater obstacles, etc. and absolutely no idea of the relationship of the ship to any nearby ships or other floating objects. Nevertheless, he or she is not only expected, but legally required to immediately figure out all of the possible permutations and combinations involved in an alteration of course or speed, determining immediately the exact combination that will avoid a collision with the one that caused the officer on watch to panic, but not cause a collision or near miss with one of the other ships. And today, to make it even worse, if they are wrong they could very well end up in prison. The previous paragraph is very long and complicated, and intentionally so. I tried to put you inside the mind of a Master. The confusion you felt is not much different than theirs. Yet they are expected to make sense of it all in a matter of seconds, render an immediate decision, and be right 100% of the time. That makes them heroes in my book. How about yours?\u201d I hope that gives you a clear understanding of the requirements of a Master; please excuse my gender fumbles, but the he/she routine became very confused. Why is the captain of a team called a skipper? Who do you think is the best captain the Indian cricket team has ever had? Why? Why was Captain Jack Sparrow a captain? What did he do to earn the title? Who is the best captain of all time in cricket? What is a Captain? In response to your answers\u2026..yes, hopefully, again seriously yes, and finally, absolutely not. To expand a very involved and nuanced topic\u2026\u2026..Captains only exist as a commissioned rank in the armed services. All other Captains are using honorary titles, no matter how big your ship. The correct construction is Mr. So-and-so, Master Mariner. This has evolved from wind-driven warships when the ship was navigated by Petty Officers called the \u201c\"Master\u201dand \u201cMaster\u2019s Mate\u201d. Their job was to navigate the ship to the scene of the battle, after which the commissioned Senior Naval Officer, called the \u201c\"Captain of the ship\u201d, but only while he is in command of that ship, fights the battle. So, when he\u2019s ashore on leave etc he\u2019d be Lieutenant So-and-so, but on assuming command of the ship he would be known as it\u2019s Captain, and addressed accordingly. So every naval ship had to have a Captain. Remember that! Now, merchant ships had ranks similar to the Petty Offucers on naval ships. The Master would sign Articles of Agreement as Master, 1st Mate, etc on down the crew list. He was still known as Mr So-and-so, Master Mariner. This became more certain with the introduction of Certificates of Competency for merchant officers. So in order to be Master, one had to have a Master\u2019scertificate, and so on. At some point,probably connected with running prize ships back to port, Petty Officers started to take command of these vessels, and hence began to be called \u201cCaptain\u201d when they sailed a prize, a captured vessel now under naval control, home. Owing to the close relationship between merchant and naval ships over the centuries this practice became the norm, and now all Masters of Merchant ships are called \u201cCaptain\u201d. But you will never see the word Captain anywhere in the various Merchant Shipping Acts that govern commercial shipping. Being Captain of a tanker or cruise ship is rather obvious, but where does it stop when working our way down the ship sizes and types. Would it be OK for the owner of a 26 foot sloop to style himself \u201cCaptain.\u201d Well of course in life you\u2019re free to call yourself what you want, but to do so and be taken seriously? I have never heard a fishing-boat Master call himself \u201cCaptain\u201d. It\u2019s always \u201cSkipper\u201d. But l have seen some splendid uniforms (almost a gold arm) on some canals and inland waterways where these vessels are found. At this point it\u2019s a matter of personal vanity. You can dress up how you like, but don\u2019t expect to be taken seriously. Moving on, I\u2019ve often marvelled at how much the \u201c\"naming of parts\u201d on an aeroplane owes to shipborne conventions. We all know port, and starboard red and green lights, galley, numbering of engines, and so much more, owe their origins to the shipping world, but how? Well,,if you think back to the earliest form of mass-transportation. You\u2019ll recall the great \u201cClippers\u201d that operated off the water between the wars on international flights. According to the Collision Regulations, when an aircraft is on the water, I.e. Float-plane today, it is not an aeroplane, but a vessel, and must follow the rules to avoid Collission. So the Pilot-in-Command becomes, honorifically, the Captain of the flying boat. Once he\u2019s off the water he could go back to Pilot-in-Command, but give up that romantic title? No way. So they took it with them to the runways and airports of the world, and nobody even thinks about it. The four stripes are not a coincidence either, nor the peaked cap. Airline pilots are more bitchy about rank than opera singers and navy officers,so in a way we did the industry a favour, since Captain sounds so much better than PILOT-in-command, and worth scrapping and clawing and scratching over. So a line can be drawn from the humble Petty Officer Master of a ship-of-the -line, who navigates his Captains ship to the scene of the battle, whereupon the Captain and Officers take over and \u201cfight the ship\u201d ,before handing what\u2019s left to the poor Master to take home, to the spectacularly kitted out Pilot-in-Command of a 787 or Airbus 380, with his film star wages and concomitant airs and graces. It\u2019s a funny old world. Please don\u2019t ask me about quality. I\u2019ve sailed with some great Captains who were seamen to their toenails, and learnt a tremendous amount from them. I have also sailed with some absolute disasters, too pathetic or incompetent to describe here. Great seamen, i.e. Captains, are born or made. It all refers back to the kind of seamen who ran the UK\u2019s ships before the greedy owners chased them off with measly rations and wages. They had a way of looking at the world, at a situation or a challenge,and quietly summing It up and the measures taken to deal with it. It\u2019s an attitude of mind, towards life, what used to be called \u201chandy\u201d, practical, common sense, highly skilled and proud of their profession. They were definitely \u201cmen\u201d in the largest sense of the word. I salute them all, and have never forgotten what they gave me. You just get a license and then you\u2019re a captain, if that\u2019s what it says on the license. There is a wide range of abilities just as for anything else - many have a driving license but you wouldn\u2019t trust your kids with all of them. There are different types of \u2018captain\u2019 according to the country. In the UK the two most common types are Master, i.e. Master Mariner as in qualified to captain a ship, and Coastal Skipper / Yachtmaster (various grades), for leisure vessels. As the UK is the last bastion of freedom on the seas, there are plenty of people driving boats around who have no qualifications at all, as there is no law that states you have to be qualified to pilot a small boat (it kicks in above 20 metres LOA or commercial). In some cases these are old boys who started before there were qualifications for leisure vessels, and have decades of experience so are often safer than newly-qualified people with a ticket of some kind. Experience is needed more than anything else. The theory helps too but it won\u2019t get you out of trouble on a rough night on a lee shore. Mind you with enough experience you probably wouldn\u2019t be there\u2026 Schedules are the biggest killers though: trying to get home for Monday morning. That and yacht tenders :) After that comes tiredness and trying to make harbour at any cost. You perhaps imply the question: what makes a  good  captain. That\u2019s probably someone who you and the vessel are safe with. All captains have limitations though, and sometimes they don\u2019t know them. \u2026. My knowledge is limited to boats under 50\u2032, mostly sail. That\u2019s all I can reasonably comment on. A Captain, in practice, and at law, is the person responsible for a vessel underweigh, whether it\u2019s a rowboat or an ocean liner. We hope that the Captain is qualified for the position. That is not always the case. Captain is a general term that covers a lot of different people with varying abilities. My experience in the U.S. Navy, merchant marine and private yachts is that the best captains exhibits calmness under pressure, considers safety of the crews as top priority and is mentor and model for Junior personnel. Age doesn\u2019t matter but experience and leadership do. You can find captains of various tonnage licensed by the Coast Guard but this does not make a person a captain. Experience and ability are the makings of a Captain.",

I am a trasngender woman, but i also feel attracted to woman, I know that hormone therapy can go incredibly wrong or leave me be something i never wanted to be. . . The thing is i know i wont get any women in the future, and at this point i dont know what i want as someone that never had a couple. I understand your fears. I've experienced all of them. First, you can't change your gender. You tell us that you are a woman. Nothing you do can change your gender, but transition almost always makes it easier for trans people to live more comfortably within their true gender. Our hormones don't have the kinds of drastic effects that you fear. You can expect Some slow growth in breast tissue Some slow redistribution of fat towards your butt and breasts. If you have male-pattern baldness, it will stop progressing, but it won't reverse. Your body hair will likely become somewhat thinner than it is now. You may be more prone to gaining weight. You may be more prone to the ailments that affect women most. You may be less prone to the ailments that affect men the most. Your mood may be affected in ways that I can't remember anymore. I found the change very affirming. And, you may be significantly less miserable, because you will be on a path to living as the woman you are. All the changes above will be slow, gradual, and reversible, especially early on. Dating for queer transgender people isn't easy. Dating isn't easy for cisgender queer people. Dating isn't easy for anyone. But the people who struggle most with dating are miserable people. Everything is hard for miserable people. As far as finding love after transition goes, you might be surprised. I was. I assumed that I would be alone for the rest of my life. Imagine my shock in discovering that a happier more balanced trans lesbian is much more attractive than a miserable, apparently straight, apparent man fighting gender dysphoria. Individual mileage will vary, but my love life has been exponentially more full than it ever was before transition. To put it in crass numerical terms, before I transitioned at age 45, I had been with six women sexually. In the seven and a half years since my transition, I have been with 24. More importantly, I have found love, profound, passionate, world-shaking love, multiple times, usually with more than one person at a time. And yes, I've had my heart broken multiple times. Romance isn't easy for anyone, but with one exception, my exes are my dearest friends. This winter, my partner and I plan to marry. At 53, with a 16 year marriage and a two year domestic partnership behind me, I am finally shopping for the perfect wedding gown. Everyone' experience is going to be different, but the assumption that no queer women will love a trans woman is simply not true. Your fears are real and understandable. I hope you can also see the hope that is available. How do I change my gender? How can I change my gender? How can it be ok to change your gender? Why did you change your gender? Men: I'm a man and I wear panties, pantyhose and a girdle to work everyday. I want girls to know. What does that mean? There are lesbian transgender people, and I even personally know one who is in a relationship with a woman. So it definitely can be done. I think you should see a gender specialist and talk about your concerns regarding hormone therapy, and decide what (if anything) to do about the medical side of your transition. If you identify as a woman, I would be inclined towards advising you to transition. But this is something to talk over with your gender specialist. One caution: make sure that your gender specialist understands that it is possible for transsexuals to also be homosexual. If they don\u2019t, find another specialist who does understand that. I think you have a lot of misconceptions on your head. First off, what is your justification for your claims about hormone replacement therapy? What do you mean it might make you into something you never wanted to be? Or even go horribly wrong? Where do these thoughts come from? And the claim that you won't get any women in the future? Wow! I mean you could be right, but what if you are absolutely wrong? If I were your therapist, I would not sign a letter for you to begin hormone therapy. If you area a transgender woman, you have to first decide if hormone therapy is right for you and if it would alleviate any dysphoria. It should not be done based on how many women you are going to get! Second of all, you have given up on yourself. Life is an evolutionary, not a creationistic, process. The third thing I see is that you have no knowledge of the safety of hormone replacement therapy. So here is my simple advice for you because I see so many transgender women like yourself in the world and few like myself in the world. The advice is: Get to know yourself, learn about HRT, attend support groups and get a gender therapist. And lastly, with the proper information, think for yourself. I wish you the best. You can absolutely be a transgender woman and a lesbian at the same time! Why don't you think you'll be able to find any women in the future? As to the risks of hormone therapy and the questions about what will happen there, it would be good to consult with a doctor-- you'll have to anyway to get a prescription for hormones; you might as well find someone you're comfortable working with ahead of time. If you don't know what you want, talk to someone supportive or look for a mental health professional-- but make sure you find one who won't be more interested in \"curing\" you than actually helping you without bias. That happened to an old friend of mine when we were younger, and it was terrible. They can also help you determine what feelings are related to your gender identity (who you are), and which are about your sexuality (who you're interested in). Check online reviews of mental health professionals in your area to see how you think they would handle your questions and what their specialties are, or search for a website or hotline with information for people asking the same questions you are. Most importantly, stay safe-- transgender women are at a higher risk than most people for being the victims of crime, unfortunately. It might help you to find a supportive community online or in your area as well. I'm going to go a bit against the grain here. Until you need to transition more than anything else in the world, more than family or friends or love or a job or even life, until you are willing to lose ALL of that, don't transition. Transitioning might not make you lose all of it, and if you live in one of the western democracies that accepts us, you probably won't lose all of it. But if you have to ask Quora about this, then you are definitely not ready.",

In that grafting a branch or, indeed, the whole trunk of the plant onto another, it is a fantastic method of \u2018cloning\u2019 a plant (particularly with fruit trees, in that an apple tree will produce highly randomized fruit when it is allowed to seed naturally, and, an orange tree might not have a resiliant root structure, but, it can be grafted onto a tree that does.) Check out wikipedia; it\u2019s been with us for a while. Quite beside, plants can be CLONED through taking a small part of an existing specimen (preferrably newer growth) and giving it a very tender environment, while it develops it\u2019s own roots. While grafting is more a matter of the plant \u2018healing\u2019 another plant onto itself, CLONING is more a matter of it\u2019s birth and growth mechanisms. Fascinatingly, there is a powder called \u2018root hormone\u2019 which can be used to \u2018hack\u2019 the physiology of the plant and increase the viability of the clone! Interestingly, Dear Ol\u2019 Charles Darwin had a hand in the discovery of root hormone, through an experiment that found newer growth, when occluded, would always prevent the parent arm of the plant from leaning toward light. Later research discovered that the new, sprig growth produces chemicals which modify the behavior of the plant as a whole (leaning towards light to support that young, happy, green growth and producing roots to support the new flesh.) So, by introducing rooting hormone to the cut-end of a cutting, the plant dutifully follows the chemical message it receives and puts out roots asap. :-D In answer to your question; it happens all the time, and, for a few bucks, you can do it at home.

        "a": "What happens to civilization once our means of production greatly outstrips demand? That\u2019s a good question. The honest answer is that we don\u2019t know, because there has never been a time in the history of human civilization when production has greatly outstripped demand. If we consider human society before civilization, during our long prehistory (which was many times longer than our civilized history to date), the argument could be made that the productivity of nature greatly outstripped human demands at the time. Marshall Sahlins called our hunter-gatherer past \u201c the original affluent society ,\u201d though obviously this was an affluence without any consumer products, and with only the demand for food, water, shelter, and clothing. This is not a time in human history without dangers and difficulties certainly. You could be killed and eaten by a cave bear or a smilondon (saber-toothed cat), and you might go hungry if your hunt is unsuccessful. But this is a very different scenario than that of an industrial civilization becoming so efficient and automated that consumer society demands could be outstripped by the productive powers of industry. Since this has never occurred on a mass scale, involving millions much less billions of people, we can\u2019t predict on this scale what would (or will) happen. The most that we can do is to outline many possible scenarios that might follow, any one of which, or none of which, might be what actually happens. For example: populations might become very lazy and no one would be wiling to do anything if they didn\u2019t have to work for it. populations might become very active in creative endeavors when freed from the necessity of making a living. people being what they are, wouldn\u2019t change much even if their circumstances changed. We experience the worst recession imaginable because recessions are what happen when supply exceeds demand (also, serious deflation). These economic consequences could be so severe that they destroy the economy and we have to start from square one, as supply no longer exceeds demand. We all get buried under a virtual tidal wave of useless but free garbage. Apart from these and similar scenarios, we might question the very idea of whether it is possible for consumer demands to be outstripped by production. Demand might be related to production exponentially, so that every increase in production produces a greater increase in demand, in which case demand always spirals beyond the reach of even the most productive economy. Implicitly, this is one of the central arguments of environmentalism against consumer society. There are other problems as well. When we think of consumer demand we tend to think of consumer products satisfying this demand, but demand is not only for products that can be produced by industry, but also for services as well as experiences. Significantly here, some experiences cannot be mass produced. Personalized service, for example, is by its very nature custom to each situation, and no productivity of industry can replace it. Unspoiled nature cannot be mass produced. There is a strictly limited area of wilderness in the world, and the number of people in the wilderness has to be limited or it would no longer be wilderness. An experience of hiking in the wilderness might be a consumer demand, but it cannot be met by industrial production. The ultimate limited commodity is time. Although our lifespans are longer than in the past, and will continue to get longer as medical science improves, the time we have on Earth in a healthy and vigorous body is limited to a few decades, and nothing will change that at the present time. In the event of productivity rising to the point of outstripping demand, we can expect that those things which cannot be produced by an industrial infrastructure, as in the examples above, will only gain in value. If anyone can own a Ferrari or an Armani suit on demand, but only a select few can experience personalized service, wilderness hikes, or an extended lifespan, then these latter things will become prestige items reserved for the privileged. Indeed, it is not difficult to imagine a time when people have all the junk that they need until they really don\u2019t want any more junk around (don\u2019t we already have enough garbage in storage that we don\u2019t use?), but what they really want are those things that are still limited in availability, like being able to take time off of work to slow down and smell the flowers.",

NAFTA immediately lifted tariffs on the majority of goods produced by the signatory nations. It also calls for the gradual elimination, over a period of 15 years, of most remaining barriers to cross-border investment and to the movement of goods and services among the three countries. The following U. S. NAFTA Web Site information is advisory only. The site is not responsible for damages caused by following the links and any information contained therein. NAFTA Summary Advance Rulings An advance ruling is a written document received from the customs authority from a NAFTA country. It provides binding information on specific NAFTA questions you may have about future imports of goods into Canada, Mexico and the United States. Certificate of Origin Ruling This is a trilaterally agreed upon form used by Canada, Mexico, and the United States to certify that goods qualify for the preferential tariff treatment accorded by NAFTA. The Certificate of Origin must be completed by the exporter. A producer or manufacturer may also complete a certificate of origin in a NAFTA territory to be used as a basis for an Exporter\u2019s Certificate of Origin. To make a claim for NAFTA preference, the importer must possess a certificate of origin at the time the claim is made. How can I export t-shirts from Egypt to the USA and Canada? As a US citizen, how do I get a loan from Canada? How do I export goods from the US to Canada? Is NAFTA a good deal for the US in 2016? How can the us legally get out of NAFTA? A NAFTA certificate is completed and signed by the exporter. Here are the instructions for completion and there is a link there to the blank form. B232 - North American Free Trade Agreement - Certificate of Origin This form should not be taken lightly, it is a legal declaration and people have gone to jail for completing fraudulent certificates. Determining if goods actually qualify for coverage under NAFTA is not as simple as most people think. Is a television assembled in the USA from parts made in China a U.S. television or a China television? Preference criteria are complicated and no your goods (probably) don\u2019t qualify under criteria A. The net cost column is not asking for a number, it is a yes or no question.

        "a": "No, because of air resistance. The K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line (about 100 km) is the altitude at which it takes less energy to accelerate into orbit than it takes to fly aerodynamically. Below that point no object can orbit without constant thrust. Even if the atmosphere were not an issue, however, a satellite might not be able to maintain such a low orbit. Mountains, seas, and tectonic plates all have different densities and pull with slightly different gravitational force. In low earth orbit (100\u2013200 km) these variations average out and are, at most, a nuisance. At 20 km, however, they would distort the orbit, likely making it unstable. The moon\u2019s (far greater) mass concentrations do the same thing at much higher altitudes than that, and there is a band of altitudes in which a stable orbit is only stable if inclined to avoid passing over these mass concentrations. What is the lowest possible stable Earth orbit? How many satellites are there in the sky above us orbiting the earth? Does it posses a threat to humanity? Is it possible to drop a rope of some sort (or wire) from a geostationary satellite to Earth so that it reaches the surface? How fast does a low Earth orbit satellite travel? How many miles above the Earth's surface are satellites? As  Walter Brameld  mentioned, it\u2019s yes without an atmosphere and no relative to Earth. Let\u2019s look at the simple math a little bit. First, say we\u2019re \u201corbiting\u201d around an object like the moon (no atmosphere), but with the same size and properties of Earth. Assuming a circular orbit, we\u2019d need a velocity of:  [math]v=\\sqrt{\\mu/r}[/math] , where u is 398,600 km^3/s^2 for Earth and r would be 6378 km (radius of Earth) + 20 km (altitude). Call that about 7.9 km/s for a circular orbit assuming no degradation due to drag. For later, we also note our orbital period is ~1.4 hours. Now let\u2019s add the atmosphere\u2026 at 20km the speed of sound in the standard atmosphere is about 300 m/s, so the Mach number of our hypothetical satellite is  [math]M=u/c[/math] , where u is our satellite velocity and c is 300 m/s. So just over Mach 26, sustained for 1.4 hours per \u201corbit\u201d. The Space Shuttle was said to reach around Mach 25 in the upper atmosphere, however, that was upon re-entry with no propulsion. I believe the fastest aircraft was the X-43 at around Mach 9, however, the propulsion system was only run for a matter of seconds and this was achieved at a much higher altitude . Long story short\u2026 you find a way to sustain Mach 26 flight for even a few minutes at 20km, call up the DoD, you\u2019re about to be rich. No, and yeah you got it in the question detail. The only thing preventing it is air. Something moving at orbital speed 20 km up would burn up like a meteor. You could do it on the moon though. It has negligible atmosphere. The highest point on the moon is 10.786 km according to NASA. So you\u2019d be safe at 11 km. If you planned your orbit carefully, you could even orbit lower than that and watch mountains whiz by you to either side!",

There\u2019s no point crying over spilt milk, instead  do something  to address the issue. I failed maths and physics in class 11. Will my school let me do the tests again? What should I do now? Who are the mathematicians who failed in some math tests? How should I do well on math tests? Should I fail my class XI maths retest? How do you pass a math test? You stay calm for 1.

        "a": "This is something what I believe \u2013 There is a god who has created the universe and earth. It has also created us and all other organisms. Why?? Most of the answers comes from different Religious Structure (Hinduism,Islam,Christianity etc\u2026). Religion are very strong pillars of humanity. These exists from very longtime in regards to universe have kept human beings as groups. Generally these group have developed a common thinking and Leader.They develop culture, Literature, Social structure, a patterned communication system. All together a belief system and made us different from animal beings. This gave humanity the most important weapon for survival power of unity. Bigger the group more powerful were they. But individual had to agree to the beliefs of the group. This way individual and groups were making each other stronger. Still there were day to day problems which were not solved by religion or group. It required some brainwork and help from nature to solve it. Research and development \u2013this is called science. Invention. There can be instances where in Groups overpower a scientific invention to be motivated by their Leader(God). The seeds of the invention were sown by god in the inventors mind. So the credit goes to Leader(God). What I believe Religion/Group has helped Humanity to establish and Science has taken it forward. It is going good. The only challenge is different Religious groups at times get into clash in regards to superiority. Generally fight is about Whose God is real and strong and the irony is never in the history any god has came down to save humanity. The fight has stopped either one side is completely destroyed or mutual agreement. One thing that I am sure of God has no involvement in Religion and Science. I believe god has created this world. Lets look at the creation little closely in Earth. Living and non Living organism, Atmosphere, gravity etc. It is a beautiful and comfortable place. But no one can escape easily. A sort of a golden cage everything is available but you cannot escape except death. Every Living organism that takes birth has to die. Whatever healthy lifestyle they may have. Yes there is an term for individual organism. If you look closely there are 2 important cycles food cycle(Hunger is the most i-resistive feeling) and reproductive cycle(one of the strongest feeling is orgasm). Common to almost all organism. There are very strong and different emotions but most of them created by social structures. The other point that one has to focus is on the gender. There are specifically 2 genders male and female present in almost all the organisms. For a new life to be created both the gender have to meet. Feeling wise orgasm and Parental love will be at the top. Orgasm so that organism can reproduce and parental love because without that infants who are weak cannot be raised or taken care off non selfishly. After birth organisms growth is important so we feel hungry and eat. So what I feel is we are all part of an invisible food cycle we are just like crop reproduced to be eaten. Eaten by our creator. Earth is just like a beautiful farm. So how do we are eaten or what part of our body is eaten in my view Soul is eaten. Just like we wait for a fruit to ripen and then we eat that similarly our creator waits the organism to gets mature and then eats it ripen soul. May be our ancestors were aware of this that is the reason sacrifices and offerings were done to gods. Its always seems God is never interested in what we are doing \u2013 no involvement in good or bad. His presence is observed only when world is about to end \u2013 injustice is prevailing \u2013 People are killing each other \u2013 there is a big chance God\u2019s source of food might get exhausted. They come to earth as avatar . So we are just a kind of crop upon death we are harvested. I also believe apart from God somebody else accompanies us as well. The other being is more helpful than god. So whatever we do in are daily life \u2013 impacts our soul gives it an experience. May be good deeds makes it more tastier and bad deeds makes it less tastier. Ageing of soul also adds the taste. Certainly there is some connection. As we are moving ahead in time we are going far away from truth. May be our ancestors knew this exactly. god is not perfect so its creation is not perfect the only purpose to human life is to become a healthy fruit. We are just carrying a soul and passing time in this world to get ripen.",

        "a": "You\u2019re putting way too much importance on sex. Is sex good? For most of us, yes. We enjoy sex. And it does play a part in enriching our lives and relationships. However, if I go a whole month without having sex, does that mean that month was wasted? Of course not. I have hobbies I enjoy. I have a job I go to where I play an important part in helping the company be successful. I have a wife who, even though I may not have had sex with her, I can share other experiences with and enjoy her company. Doing little things like making her laugh or seeing the smile on her face when I tell her she is beautiful, make me happy and in turn make my life enjoyable. A life with happiness is a life with meaning, sex or no. Who wins at life? What is the meaning of life? What gives life meaning and purpose? Has a person ever said something to you that made you rethink your life? What is the purpose of life? Listen\u2026 we\u2019ve made it possible for a human life to begin without sex\u2026 society has increasingly seen it as impossible to enjoy a human life without sex... The basic premise of recent Hollywood comedies like  The 40 Year Old Virgin  and  40 Days and Nights  demonstrates this \u2013 the first chronicles a man\u2019s increasingly desperate attempts to have sex for the first time; in the second another younger man struggles to last just 40 days and nights without it\u2026 So, for many in our world today, to call people to more than 40 days and nights without sex, to more than 40 years, in fact to potentially a whole lifetime without it, sounds totally implausible, even comical\u2026.sometimes the implication is almost that I\u2019m not quite human because I have yet to experience such a basic human right and experience as sexual intercourse\u200b\u2026so be a human and have sex like animals\u2026 Yes. It has the purpose and meaning that you give it. If you spend all your time sitting around and feeling bad because you aren\u2019t having sex, then you are: A: wasting your life. Go have some fun. B: much less likely to actually have sex, because nobody wants to bang someone who is always depressed and super-desperate for human contact. C: much more likely to end up with someone just because they have sex with you. This is a very bad idea, and leads to terrible misery. The remedy? Go have some fun! And remember the age old wisdom: \u201cSex is fun, sex is great, sex is why we masturbate!\u201d Do you mean reproduction? Then probably not, from a biological perspective. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t contribute to reproduction by servicing the economy or becoming involved more directly in reproductive services (medical, educational, etc.) I'm a living example to prove that life definitely does have a purpose without sex. There was time I didn't have sex for 7 years straight in my life and yet have a purpose. By the way I'm 32 good looking lean and active guy, so it wouldn't have been hard to have sex all those years. But I don't not because I was more into my career and exploring life without sex. Having said that, I now indulge myself in sex as much as possible as it is part of human life,while I still bring meaning into my life.",

        "a": "A2A. The Champions League final will have no room for error this year and will be decided on the slightest of details. Some particularities jump to my mind as a Real Madrid fan: Juve are the last team to eliminate Madrid from this competition. There obviously has to be revenge in this final. Morata, the guy who eliminated Real Madrid in Juve\u2019s favor, has switched back jerseys. He\u2019ll be itching to repay Madrid for that. He owes us one. Higuain never scores in finals so far\u2026 Ronaldo always scores against Juventus. Every match. Zidane has realized that Benzema plays better on the wing than he does in the center. Hope he sets it that way in the final. I fear for Real Madrid in the case Bale returns for the final. The chemistry the team has developed up till now would be broken. His return is usually synonymous with a mini-crisis. Real Madrid will likely concede a goal, as has been the custom all season. Juve will not be as incisive as Madrid, but they will both create chances. Real Madrid has been showing an astounding level of desire all through the season. I don\u2019t think any other team has shown as much desire as Madrid. This Champions League has taught me that desire, added to quality, wins matches. Case in point; Barca-PSG fiasco. The winner will be the team that is more clinical with their chances. Who will win the Champions League this year (Real Madrid or Juventus)? Is Real Madrid the favourite to win the Uefa Champions League 2015-16? If Juventus wins the 2017 Champions League, will Buffon win Goal Keeper of the year? Who will win the UEFA Champions League 16/17? Will Neymar ever become the best player in football? I think  Real Madrid  will win  The   Champions League  because they are in great form and their players are in form too at the right time. Because, I am a  Madridista,  so hoping for  Real   Madrid  to win. But it is football anything can happen. Juventes are in great form too. They have won  Copa Italia  already and in position to win the  Serie A  2016\u201317. So they are in good momentem and willing to complete  Continental Treble . But the superstar form  Madrid  \u2018Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019  ending the season on a high having scored  8 goals  in last  4  Champions League  appearences and back to back  braces  in  La Liga  will do his best to win his  4th Champions League  trophy. As for pressure is concerned, In my thought  Juve  will have more than  Real . Juve have lost  6 UCL  finals  most recently in 2015. So they have more pressure and for  Real  they have not lost their last  5 UCL  finals  but they have a little bit preaaure of winning the trophy back to back because no team has done it before in  UCL  era. So wiiling for the best team at that night to win. I am with  Madrid.  Are you? Thanks for reading. The Messi and Barcelona fan in me is pushing me to say Juventus. But if I'm being completely honest, I think Real Madrid stand a better chance of winning. R. Madrid always seem to be a completely different team in the champions league. And there's the issue with their current form. They're playing some great football at the moment, with Ronaldo particularly being terrifyingly on form. People might argue that Juventus have been great defensively especially against the likes of Bar\u00e7a. It should be pointed out though that there's a directness in Madrid\u2019s play that is clearly missing in Bar\u00e7a\u2019s and it would be interesting to see how Allegri deals with it. But in the end, I only always trust Bar\u00e7a to deliver against Madrid in recent times. And while Juventus is a good team, I still think Real Madrid would win. PS: Would be a Juventus sympathisers during the final, because football is after all unpredictable! I\u2019m quietly confident in Juventus winning. They outplayed Barcelona majestically. If they can pull up that tight defense against Real, they have every chance of winning. Higuain is itching to get revenge over Real, and Dani Alves is no stranger to matches againt them. I think it will be Juventus. They\u2019ve been very consistent during the whole season and showed up in big moments. Also, history is on their side because no team has defended their title in the Champions League era. Real Madrid is the current champion so\u2026",

Good Backlinks It\u2019s very important that the backlink is coming from a relevant website in your industry. Links inside the content are better. Links from long and quality articles are worth more. For SEO, the backlink has to be dofollow. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t mean that nofollow backlinks are bad. They can drive referral traffic, but they will not give you an SEO boost. You shouldn\u2019t categorize nofollow links as bad. The backlink is good when an editor added it. The website that\u2019s linking to you has a good domain authority and a solid social media presence. Bad Backlinks The link is coming from an unrelated website to your niche and industry. Relevancy is very important. The backlink is on a page with very thin and low-quality content. A backlink is bad if it\u2019s from a website that was penalized by Google. Dofollow site wide and footer backlinks can trigger Google penalties. Link exchanges are bad. The website linking to you has a very low Domain Authority. The backlink is from a blog network. Widget backlinks are bad and should be nofollow. A backlink is bad if you paid money for it. Advertorials should use the nofollow attribute. A backlink is bad if it\u2019s coming from article directories. A link is bad if it\u2019s from hacked websites or it\u2019s hidden in CSS.

One is Dangal\uff0cwhich is called \u6454\u8de4\u5427\u7238\u7238 \uff08The translation is weird and crap. If you traslate it back to English, it\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Wrestle! Dad!\u201d And at the beginning, such a name indeed kept people from watching it.\uff09 Another is Guardian of the Galaxy 2. \u94f6\u6cb3\u62a4\u536b\u961f2. It\u2019s just a Hollywood name. Today is 5.18, and let\u2019s see the ticket sale. As you can see, Dangal(\u6454\u8de4\u5427\uff01\u7238\u7238) ranks at the first palce. But about cumulated ticket sales ,Guardian is 600751k yuan, and Dangal is 536142k yuan. It seems Dangal lags behind. But this is unfair. Because Hollywood movies always have an advantage over other kind of movies. And if you look carefully enough, you would find Guardians seems to lose strength while Dangal is gaining momentum. I mean, daily ticket sale for Guardians would only go down whereas Dangal would go up and up. Here is the ticket sale on 5.11 to 5.17. As you can see, this week Dangal leads everyday, and the difference is widening day by day. That is typical movement of ticket sales of excellent movies compared to pop-corn movies. Pop-corn movies usually has a large ticket sales in the first few days due to their marketing or just their Hollywood origin. But after these splatters and fuss, their ticket sale drop dramatically, maybe into oblivion. There might be only one peak of their movement. But movies like Dangal are different. Due to their excellence, Dangals would enjoy peak after peak of ticket sales, because people who have watched them want to watch them again and again and recommend Dangal to their friends and relatives. So the ticket sale would continue to soar. Another important factor is Chinese social website like Zhihu \u77e5\u4e4e and DouBan\u8c46\u74e3\u3002 These sites just offer great channels to promote Dangal. Personally, I have watched both movies. This is how I feel when I was watching Guardians:(Because as a native Chinese\uff0c I have never heard about the movie before) And this is how I feel when watching Dangal: \uff08when Geeta won the gold medal\uff09 (when Geeta phoned Amir after she failed in the games) \uff08when Amir Khan was training his daughters\uff09 An interesting fact is that Amir Khan came to China to market Dangal\uff0cChinese people seemed to forget that this is the actor in 3 idiots and Amir failed to get much attention\uff0cat least not much as expected. Turns out that when it comes to foreign movies that is not Hollywood, you have to be excellent to intrigue Chinese audience. About PK, I watched first half of the movie, and even though I find it deep and impressive, I don\u2019t think it will appeal to Chinese audience since the majority of us are not interested in religion. By the way, can anybody teach me how to say the lines when Amir confronted the coach? the basic meaning of these lines are like: Coach: Then you tell me how to win the wrestle game! Amir: With your permission I will show you how to wrestle right now. Who do I like most in Dangal? Not Geeta, not even Amir Khan, it\u2019s him! He is the nicest guy throughout the movie. He got beaten and punched by his sisters,his uncle and his aunt, and had his clothes tailored for his sisters, and forced to train with his two sisters, but he never complained. He just loves his uncle and sisiters so much. Why did the Chinese love the \u201cDangal\u201d movie? Why do the Chinese like Dangal, the movie? How many times did you watch Dangal movie? For the Chinese, is Dangal really a hit in China? What is your opinion about the movie Dangal? Yes , \u2018Dangal\u2019 has gone really wild in China. The total box office in 14 days since its release on 2017\u201305\u201305 has reached \uffe5535 millions (22:35 2017\u201305\u201318 GMT+8:00 ), and still growing repidly (Box office today is \uffe525.3 millions). I think the final revenue will reach $100m and beyond. Yes. It is extremely popular in China. The box office revenue so far amounted to 460 million RMB, or Rs. 4.6 billion (as of May 17, 2017).  http://www.chinanews.com/cul/201... It also received stormy critical acclaims. Excellent word of mouth enabled it to rival Hollywood blockbusters and made it to No. 1 box office star in China now. I have not seen it yet, but judging by Three Idiots and PK, I have full confidence in Amir. He is truly a genius with a heart of gold. Yes, it is. I watched Dangal last night, and have no doubt there\u2019ll be millions of others finding this movie enjoyable and inspiring. The box office is phenomenal for a non-Hollywood foreign movie, which is set to reach $100m by this weekend and has potential to approach $150m in the next few weeks. The only other non-Hollywood foreign film which ever enjoyed such popularity was the Japanese animation \u201cYour Name\u201d, on screen last year. For reference, the top record of box office for a foreign film in China is Furious 7, $390m, followed by its sequel The Fate of Furious, $380m. Yes it is very hot hot hot in China! Two reasons: 1 it is a good movie! 2 it is a good Indian movie that make many Chinese surprised( who only know Hollywood movies)! I have followed the dangal on twitter and as a Chinese I am surprised that your Indian movie fans are actually divided as south and north fans (e.g baahubali for south and dangal for north) and it seems that you don't like each other that much! The doubts for dangal\u2019s success in china are 100% from South Indian fans, which make Chinese laugh because nobody has the power to manipulate a film\u2019s b.o in china! For Chinese, baahubali and dangal are all Indian movies! I have watched baahubali 1 years ago which was also a good movie! It only got 75cr because there was no promotion for it at all in china! The success of Dangal will surely make film distributors spend more money to promote Indian movies in china! Chinese market is the second largest in the world! The total b.o is 45 billion last year compared with 75 billion rmb of US+Canada ! Judging from 2700cr for Hollywood fast and furious 8, Dangal\u2019s b.o is just good (if dangle were in 3D, the total b.o would be doubled, an average ticket for a 3D film is twice as that of 2d\u2019s)",

        "a": "When spoken in casual speech, I think it\u2019s okay. As others have said, \u2018words and works\u2019 being plural, \u2018they are\u2019 may be better than \u2018it is\u2019, but since conceptually you are discussing the \u2018ministry\u2019 of Jesus of Nazareth, I would think this instance of the singular it would be acceptable. You are also saying that those works and words are THE salvation, which is singular. Off topic, slightly, I would commend you for focusing on the words and work of Jesus. Far too many of his self-proclaimed followers ignore His words and works to focus on Old testament proscriptions or the rantings of Paul, when the ministry of Jesus was supposed to change all of that. The message is about God\u2019s love for us, and our love of our fellow man. What is the etymology of word the Jesus? Does the Tamil word Eesun referring to Lord Shiva become (J)esus? What word starting with Y can I use to describe a great person? Only with the appearance and work of the Lord Jesus has the significance of the redemption been completed. Is the sentence Grammatically right... Is it right to use \"look at\" here: \u201cOnce we look at the words of Jesus and hear the testimonies of the Church, we'll be clear on it.\"? What are the best one words used to describe a person? Yes, because it is only referring to the words, not to the person speaking them. Notice that \u201cthe words and works\u201d of Jesus isn\u2019t capitalized either. You would probably want to substitute \u201cthey\u201d for it, though, simply because \u201cwords and works\u201d is plural. Because \u201cwords and work of Jesus\u201d are plural, it would be preferable to use the plural pronoun,  they,  not  it.  However, as you point out, this is casual conversation; so our speech need not be perfect. It does not agree - there's not subject/verb agreement.  'It' refers back to - the words and work of Jesus' are - plural It should be 'they'-  They are the path to God's salvation.  Or this -  The words of Jesus are the path to God's salvation. Walk that path with faith and you will find peace and salvation.",

        "a": "I personally have not encountered this issue, but I have a couple of theories as to why someone might write a Quora biography in 3rd person: Many people on Quora come from academic backgrounds that discourage writing in first person. It\u2019s seen as informal. Writing a biography in 3rd person might be an extension of this habit. If you've ever been to a conference or event where biographies are presented (like for a keynote speaker), it'll always be in third person, even if the speaker wrote it himself. Writing in first person in these situations is considered tacky. If a user views Quora as an extension of his/her personal \u201cbrand\u201d or as part of a professional social media presence, writing in 3rd person may subjectively be seen as impartial. The assumption in the question is not necessarily correct. There could be hundreds of users who have agents and social media correspondents who fill out this information. You can\u2019t be absolutely sure it\u2019s the user in every instance. To go along with #3, it wouldn\u2019t be implausible for a person to take a blurb written about them by a third party (for a formal introduction, academic announcement, conference proposal, book dedication, or other text biography) and use it on Quora. Maybe they  are  just pretentious. As I said, I haven\u2019t noticed it, so I don\u2019t really have a strong opinion on the issue. Thanks for the A2A! Is it unethical for someone to write his own biography on Wikipedia? How do I write my own biography in 'second person'? How would you parody your own writing style on Quora? How can I add a topic bio for myself on Quora? How do I write a biography about a sports person in 500 words? Why do some Quora users write their own biographies in the third person? Grammarly  image search They do this to see their story objectively, which is hard to do in first person. In first person  you are you  and cannot distance yourself from the hurt or the absurdity. If it is \u201canother\u201d you being observed, you can edit the details or form a better explaination for your actions. You keep yourself from being in the moments of embarrassment , shame, lost, unhappiness, desperation and take on the \u201csafe\u201d role of narrator. Or you can become an objective observer of all that is playing out. The  other  is promoting  you . Biographies are still stories after all. Somethings you just don\u2019t want to relive or continue to lie about. This is liken to  dissociation  but is moreso a  depersonalization . Sources Writing and Publishing Science Research Papers in English Gigi has never written in the third person, and she doesn\u2019t know why other people would. If she did, she\u2019d find out it\u2019s quite a curious sensation. It does feel pretentious! (To make it even more pretentious, She\u2019s decided to capitalize Her pronouns. She hopes God doesn\u2019t strike Her down.) On the other hand, perhaps She just wants to find out what an out of body experience feels like. Purely as a scientific experiment. She\u2019s willing to try  anything , as long as it\u2019s completely safe, as a means to expand Her mind, and writing in the third person does just that. She will do no drinking of chemicals whipped up in the basement lab that turn Her into Mrs. Hyde. She will not step through an armoire to meet up with a talking lion who thinks he\u2019s all that. Nor will She talk to voices coming out of a television set when there\u2019s nothing on, making the family frantic trying to find Her show in the TV Guide. \u201cThey canceled her show? WTH? It was great! Now what do we do on Wednesday night?\u201d She saw a Twilight Zone episode where a little girl disappeared into another dimension right through her-the little girl\u2019s- bedroom wall. (There are downsides to existing in the third person. Pronouns can get hopelessly tangled, and may even lead to WWIII if One isn\u2019t careful during peace talks.) The little girl\u2019s parents called a friend to help them look, and after he\u2019d searched for awhile, he told them-get this- \u201dLet\u2019s call a physicist to come over and look into this.\u201d Can you beat that? Having a physicist on speed dial who makes house calls? At two am? They stopped making house calls sometime in the 60s, I believe. At any rate, Gigi has explored this subject now, and She thinks writing in the third person is a remarkable experience. Gigi thinks You\u2019re the Bottom,  Martha! Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) - Wikipedia As a supplement to  Justin Franco's answer , I'll give you my explanation, as I am one of these pretentious fools who writes third person bios about himself. In my case, it was never intended to be self important. On the contrary, I intended it to be funny and it reflects upon my particular sense of humor, which you likely find incredibly stupid. I find self-deprecation in the third person a bit funny regardless, and I consider myself so totally insignificant that the mere thought that anyone would write a profile of such a boring and trivial person as myself only adds to the humor. Here is my profile bio, which I wrote when I first joined Quora and had zero followers or recognition: Both too smart and too foolish for his own good. Knows all the Kings and Queens of England in order, knows off hand the top speed of an SR-71 Blackbird, but has never successfully remembered which tax form he's supposed to fill out without looking it up. Memory is a funny thing. Never take him too seriously\u2026 You might not find it the least bit amusing and that's fine, but I chuckled when I wrote it. That's just my sense of humor. It is further reflected in my personal blog, titled  Tom Robinson Should Not be Allowed on the Internet . The description for my blog reads as follows: This blog is dedicated to documenting the various tomfoolery of this miscreant in order to show that he is a menace to society. Hopefully it will help spread awareness of this hoodlum\u2019s various antics so that more people may protect their friends and loved ones from his nefarious influence. I sincerely hope that, through this compilation of posts and answers both written and supported by this nutcase, the purity of the children may be protected all over the world. You don't have to find any of that the least bit entertaining, indeed you are allowed to find it pretentious and extremely unfunny. Nonetheless, I feel that it gives a taste of the kind of writer I am and the nature of my sense of humor, which is what I saw as the purpose of the bio in the first place. Not everyone who writes in the third person takes himself too seriously. Some of us do it because we don't take ourselves seriously at all. I write in all person methods. Why? because it allows me to separate some of the pain. I also hide pieces of my own past within fiction. I will write in first person from another perspective (which is actually the easiest - and separates the reader from me). This distance allows me to write freely (or more free than not) about very painful subjects. I also use writing tricks (changing genders, names, places, ages) in order for people to feel like it\u2019s more fiction than not. In creative writing I was taught that even memoirs are about 80\u201390% truth, because we never remember every word of every conversation, but we can recreate the conversation from the emotional echoes. We can write from another viewpoint separating the writer and reader from the intensity of the event. I employ all these and more.",

        "a": "After all the allegations of dishonesty against Hilary Clinton, nothing has been proved worse that the sort of shading of opinions for different audiences that any politician does. There has been a huge amount of mud thrown, and you are saying that, for you, it has stuck. I find no evidence of her being more dishonest than any other establishment politician. Will Hillary Clinton go to jail? What is it like to be Hillary Clinton today? Why should one vote for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election? Did Hillary Clinton lie about Benghazi? Is Hillary Clinton a war hawk? Yes, and I did, given the alternative. (Though I'd say your statement that \u201cshe has yet to be honest with us today\u201d needs to be qualified. There's plenty she's honest about, though also some serious things she's not been honest about.) See, the thing is, \u201cbeing honest\u201d is not the same thing as \u201ctelling you what you think is true\u201d, which is what you apparently believe it to be. If I\u2019m convinced the moon is made out of green cheese, and yet all the scientists I talk with tell me it\u2019s made out of rock, they\u2019re not being \u201cnot honest\u201d, they\u2019re just reporting on what reality is. Hillary Clinton is as honest as almost all politicians, and more honest than most, going by what can be objectively proved, so when you say she has \u201c not been honest in the past and has yet to be honest with us today \u201d, you\u2019re putting yourself in the position of the Green Cheese Moon person. She persists in telling you that the moon is made of rock, so you claim she is not being honest with us. Given that as far as I can tell, she is both relatively honest and has a pretty good head on her shoulders, and I find many of her policy positions to be infinitely preferable to the anti-American lunacy of the modern GOP, I would certainly have voted for her again. I doubt that she will run for President again, even if we have actual elections in the future, but if she did, and if her opponent were not more to my preference, I wold have no trouble voting for her. No I would never vote for Hillary Clinton. TRUMP was not my candidate either but he was the one that happen to win the Republican primary to run for POTUS. I voted for Trump because I knew we needed a big change. Hillary, besides the lies her main promblem to me is you never knew what agenda she was pushing for. If she was at a conference and it was mainly people that were against gay marriage then Hillary was to. If she was at a conference and the majority was for gay marriage than she was for it. Now this is just a example way more important agendas she was two sided on. We had Obama for 8 yrs and Hillary didn't try to run her own campain she thought that since Trump was the Republican Primary winner than she had already won. No matter what Hillary ever does she will never have my support. One of the things that got me was also she thought that she was above the law. When you go to boot camp you learn then not to speak, write, or photograph anything classified or you maybe spending a couple years in the brig depending on the severity of it. She had no excuse not to use government approved server. I mean we pay for it all out of taxes. No she knew that Comey wouldn't charge her for treason if she was found out. Sad thing is alot of classified information was sent to Abadean and she sent it to Weiner so he could print it. Also Chris Stevens begged her for more protection in the US Embassy in Bengazzi but no she didn't even respond to him, well now 4 Americans will never see there loved ones again. When Hillary was the Secretary of State she was the last one to sign off on 20% of Uranium to be sold to Russia. The reason because the ones who were in the deal payed her millions to Clinton Foundation. So again she made millions off the same ones she says she hates. Now Trump was a buisness man so if he had dealings with Russia on real estate that was his buisness as a developer. She was a politician while she done buisness with Russia and so as her husband been paid millions for being a lobbyists there. People need to k ow the truth behind the Clinton scandals and also behind some of the murders thay are linked to the DNC. I could go on and on but I would never vote for Hillary Clinton. What has led you believe that Secretary Clinton has had some kind of epiphany and that the Hillary Clinton of today is radically different than the Hillary Clinton of the 2016 campaign or any other previous time? Hillary Clinton has psychological problems, and those don\u2019t just go away because she wants to stay in the game and lead \u201cthe resistance.\u201d In fact, those problems are part of the reason you might think she\u2019s suddenly changed. She is an habitual liar, even when she doesn\u2019t need to be. She has a terminal tendency to hide things, to cover up, even when she doesn\u2019t need to. She is motivated by money and power, even as she is decrying both out of the other side of her mouth. She refuses to accept criticism or to take the blame for her own terrible decisions. She will tell you what you want to hear, even if it\u2019s contrary to something she told someone else two days before. The fact that she seems to be gearing up for yet another Presidential run in 2020 should be all you need to see the depth of the delusion on the part of Secretary Clinton and those that are advising her.  The Republicans ran the worst candidate imaginable, and she lost . And her takeaway isn\u2019t that she was the worst candidate that the Democrats could have run, it\u2019s \u201cthe Russians,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cDirector Comey,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cWikileaks,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cthe Bernie Bros.\u201d She honestly believes that, with all of those things out of the way, she\u2019ll sail on to the nomination and the White House. Read  Shattered , it\u2019s an excellent examination of everything that was wrong with her campaign, and she\u2019s at the center of it, not all of her excuses. Post-election, post-analysis, post reading that book, I  still  have no idea why she thought she should be President, apart from some weird sense of entitlement. No, I would not vote for Hillary Clinton for dog catcher, much less for President. We need a good, no, a great, Democratic nominee in 2020, and she is not it, not by any stretch of the imagination.",

If you have visited a doctor and used their bathroom just to take a shit for 30 minutes, then it is completely normal for him to check on you. You taking shit for 30 minutes in your house is okay but not in a public place, that too, in a clinic. From the doctor\u2019s point of view, patients who come to him at the clinic are sick and anyone can deteriorate anytime. Hence, he is right to have done so. By the way, you need not be old or have a pre-existing disease to have a catastrophic illness within minutes. What if you had fainted which can happen during defecation or if you had a seizure? Why doctors don't take 30 minute history of patients as they take during their exams? If a teenager has diarrhea and nausea, and is going to the bathroom every 30 minutes, what is the best thing to do? If someone has very high level of TSH in his/her blood approx 30 times more than normal, then what stategy he/she should follow for their trea... For normal check up, what kind of doctor I should see? All men on my dad's side have bad diabetes so far. I am a guy. Does this mean my brother and I are at high risk? In others words, the question reads  \u2018I tell my brother I am doing something that should take max 5\u201310 minutes. If I am gone for more than 30 minutes he will check up on me. Is that normal?\u2019 Is it normal? For some people it is normal to not care. Some people lie dead in their apartment for weeks because nobody bothered to check they were okay. Barging in seems a bit excessive (especially if you have locked the door and he habitually breaks it), when a simple knock and \u2018you ok?\u2019 would do. You just happen to enjoy chilling in the toilet, but for all he knows you may have accidentally locked yourself in, passed out or be suffering from horrible constipation (which he as a doctor can help you with). Perhaps you should raise the issue with him and not the strangers on the internet? Its absolutely NORMAL ! Infact, its very kind and considerate of him with his busy schedule ! Furthermore, I\u2019d like to add: Firstly, Its excellent that anyone even cares to check up on you at all in life !  Secondly, why are you defecating for more than 30 minutes ? Constipation Issues ? Thirdly, If you are blood related and he is a medical professional, shouldn\u2019t you be glad to have someone around considering your odd bowel movement habits/unhealthy lifestyle ? Lastly, You should get yourself medically checked if you need more than 30 minutes to defecate ! Or is it a Isolation Issue ? Checking by knocking on the door would be the correct thing to do. Your entire gut area (Stomach, intestines, etc.) are contained in and tightly bound integument, with the exception of your\u2026 butt. When you sit on the toilet, the pressure of your entire gut area presses on your anus, and can prolapse, or internal rectal intussusception, or at the minimum cause hemorrhoids. So, yes, sitting on the toilet for 30 minute stints is very unhealthy, and your doctors concerns are quite correct. (Don\u2019t put your TV in the bathroom). You\u2019ve heard the expression \u201c  Either sh*t or get off the pot \u201d\u2026 they were talking about  you . The act of defecation could take time in a wide range, some take the dump in 2\u20133 minutes while some others might as well take an hour altogether. Many a times it\u2019s not usually the act of dump itself where people pass their time in. And, it\u2019s surely wrong to say that everybody must take only 5 minutes to to do it. It\u2019s not a call for a doctor. But there\u2019re a few people who have wrong practices and may pass abnormally longer time. Here, they could be helped by lifestyle physicians like me who could change your styles and see if you\u2019re not doing anything that might make you a prospective patients in time to come. So, yes if you\u2019re taking way longer time and doing something wrong you yourself are not sure about, it might lead to GI problems.

China would need to give a pretty strong and real incentive that Taiwan can\u2019t match for Vietnam to stop having relations with Taiwan. It\u2019s not worth going to through the trouble for something quite minor. What are the benefits? Vietnam is one of targeted countries in the phase of Taiwan New Southbound policy which seeks to forge closer trade and economic ties. Vietnam is a sovereign state, so literally no one can forced us to do this or that. What\u2019s next ? Stop having relations with Japan ? Stop having relations with USA ? Stop having relations with India ? \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Oh pff Yes Vietnam adheres to the one China policy , but we will not stop having relations with Taiwan ! This is a false question. China won\u2019t force anyone to stop relations with Taiwan except diplomatic relation and military relation. Vietnam does not have sucn relations with Taiwan. A few days ago Vietnam re-announced it\u2019s against Taiwan\u2019s independence and support China\u2019s re-unification. So it\u2019s already happening. Also note China supported Vietnam otherwise there would be 2 Vietnams today.",

        "a": "That article is click bait. It attempts to compare two things that cannot be compared. People without children have no idea what it\u2019s like to be parents, so they have no basis for comparison when reporting their happiness. And it certainly seems that quite a lot of people just shouldn\u2019t be parents, since they underestimate the amount of time, energy, and sacrifice required. My daughter is 27 years old, and I raised her myself. My ex-husband decided, when my daughter was 7 months old, that fatherhood wasn\u2019t for him, even though we had planned the pregnancy. He made three minimal visits between that time and her 4th birthday, then disappeared. I didn\u2019t bother to go after him for child support after that, feeling that his yearly visits would be much more damaging than his complete absence. There has never been a single moment when I have been disappointed, either with my daughter or with being a parent. It\u2019s just as difficult, rewarding, frustrating, amazing, challenging, heartbreaking, and awesome as I expected. There have been incredible highs and life-changing lows. Mostly, there have been average, regular days. I always treated her like a human being, explaining my decisions to her as appropriate to her age. When she was a child, I made sure I was never too busy to play with her. I did my best to remember how I felt and how the world looked to me at whatever age she was, so I didn\u2019t fall into the trap of being overprotective and controlling. When she was a teen, I made sure she was never afraid to talk to me. I passed on to her as much knowledge as possible, because knowledge is power. Now that she\u2019s an adult, I\u2019m infinitely proud of her on the daily. Raising a child is the single most difficult thing you will ever do. It\u2019s a 24/7 job with no pay, no training, no benefit package, and no retirement. Yet it is also the single most rewarding thing you\u2019ll ever do\u2026if you commit to it. I guess I can\u2019t actually answer your question, because having a child and being a parent has never been disappointing to me. What is the weirdest thing you have seen a child draw? What is the one thing you regret doing or not doing the most in your life? Are there any lies that your parents told you as a kid that you believed for longer than you'd like to admit? What is the most interesting thing people have said about you for being an IITian? What is the weirdest or most disturbing thing that a kid has said? *When they don\u2019t seem to have that many of your genes, both physical and mental. When they seem to have mostly inherited your husband\u2019s genes, not yours. Vanity I know, but still off-putting somehow. *When you love them, but don\u2019t particularly like them that much (sometimes happens). Not projecting here, just an observation based on years of experience talking to other parents. *When, occasionally, they are just very ungrateful (\u201c How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child\u201d - William Shakespeare). *When they seem to go out of their way not to take your advice on much of anything, particularly if they are mildly autistic and totally out of touch with reality anyway! When you know that if they don\u2019t take your basic health advice you will probably outlive them (happens). Sigh. (personal experience here) *When, despite your best efforts to inculcate into them honesty, they lie and steal anyway. When they lie and steal despite a good number of years attending Sunday school also. (So both of us- individual and institutional- failed miserably). Seen it happen, not with my kids but other\u2019s kids. What people don\u2019t realize is, your children are not born blank slates, but are the result of dozens, if not, hundreds of past lives so bring with them those influences, however subtly. Finding out I didn\u2019t know everything Finding out the parts of myself I did not like Watching them grow up, and realizing I didn\u2019t have a cuddly baby any more.

        "a": "There actually has been a language created for \u201ceveryone\u201d, and it's called Esperanto. Esperanto was created by L. L. Zamenhof in an attempt to make a language that is: The easiest to learn. \u201cMake it's acquisition mere play to the learner\u201d. A true, lingua franca for the whole world. He wanted Esperanto to allow everybody to speak together, even if Esperanto was not universally accepted. A language that could bring together the world in peace and harmony. \u201cTo find some means of overcoming the indifference of mankind\u2026\u201d Its been around since the late 1800\u2019s, early 1900\u2019s, and for a period of time it was really quite influential. The Leauge of Nations almost accepted Esperanto as their working language (just  one  jealous French delegate vetoed it), and the Leauge of Nations recommended that the language be taught in their member countries. It was also pretty big in Germany and Russia, though in Germany it was mostly protested against due to the fact tha L. L. Zamenhof was a Polish Jew. The Soviet Union gave the language government support. Today the language is less popular, but there a few Micronesian nations that have it as a second language, and China has state sponsored television and radio broadcasts in the language. The language is very Slavic influenced, but it is exceptionally easy to learn. It would not be too much to become vaguely fluent in the language, maybe one or two years of daily study to become totally fluent, even for non indo-European language speaker. The main problem is logistics. No country wants to support the learning of this language, and not enough individuals are personally motivated enough to learn it. There  is  a language for everyone, but not everyone wants to learn it. What one word in one language, if any, does everyone on Earth know? Is the Tamil language slowly dying? What is the first language spoken by humans? Why are there so many languages in the world? Considering the different properties among programming languages, why don't we just pack all of them up and implement them in one programming ... Forcing one language upon the entire planet would be impossible to execute, especially in areas with poor educational funding and a lack of resources. Not only would it be impractical for this reason, but it would deprive entire societies of a defining aspect of their cultures. Many people identify with each other ethno-linguistically. To deny them an important part of their lives due to a unifying, globalist program would deprive them of their cultural identities. To do this would be to lay the grounds for fascism. In  1984 , Newspeak was designed to be a global language \u2013 simplified and easy to understand. The dystopian, totalitarian society in this novel promoted it in order to restrict freedom of expression and creativity. In this age especially, linguistic diversity and reasoned use of language is critical for democracy. Additionally, individual languages are possessed of their own unique sonorities, which may be employed in the crafting of poetry dependent on those sonorities. To have a global language would be to eliminate the beauty of individual languages \u2013 destroying the unique euphony of English, French, Persian, and other languages which have contributed immensely to the realm of poetry. Indeed, many linguists, disregarding this reasoning, have attempted to construct universal languages \u2013 the most notable being Ido and Esperanto. These languages, however, have failed to gain a significant number of speakers \u2013 and remain more curiosities than popularly practiced tongues. There\u2019s an ambiguity in your question: whether by \u201cone language for everyone\u201d you mean, \u201cThere is one language and every person speaks that language\u201d or \u201cFor every person, there is a unique language they speak.\u201d Since the latter formulation (which I happened to interpret first) would be useless, since everyone\u2019s private language cannot be used to communicate with others, I\u2019ll assume you are asking about the former. One doesn\u2019t generally invent languages for people. For every relative success in inventing languages like Esperanto (and by \u201csuccess\u201d I mean \u201cabout 1000 native speakers, all bilingual with another language), world history is littered with failures. Sure, conlanging \u2014 inventing languages as a creative activity \u2014 is popular and fun, but getting other people to adopt your constructed language is far more of a challenge. And getting people to raise their children in your constructed language \u2014 acquiring native speakers \u2014 is much harder still. Of the 7,000 languages you mention in your question, at least half are not gaining native speakers. And that\u2019s natural languages with histories and cultures attached! (I suppose a counter-question to your question would be: Well, if you ask, why aren\u2019t you getting on this and raising your children in Esperanto? We did invent a language for everyone, so why aren\u2019t you using it?) Because, as I\u2019ve said before, a language is not just a communication tool. For communication, having one language for everyone would make sense. But a language is a marker of group identity. It\u2019s a way of distinguishing people who are like you from people who are not like you (even within \u201cEnglish\u201d there are thousands of subtypes and variants like \u201cYorkshire English,\u201d \u201cEnglish spoken in Andhra Pradesh,\u201d \u201cLondon upper-class English,\u201d \u201cChicago rappers\u2019 English,\u201d \u201csoftware engineers\u2019 English\u201d...) Not every one of the seven billion people on earth is like you. And they don\u2019t want to be. So adopting a single language of Earth would mean erasing your identity as a member of a particular specific group, a group that you have ties to, a group that you love. It would only work by force (check various histories of trying to legalize languages out of existence, from the attempts to erase Native American languages in residential schools, to the history of Breton in France, to Ryukyuan languages in Japan; none of them left people happy, ever). Even adopting a second language as a lingua franca to speak with others who have different first languages results in the lingua franca becoming different in different sources. Second-language speakers of English in India speak differently from second-language speakers of English in Sweden. Not just because one or the other group hasn\u2019t been taught properly, or just because their first language influences it; but because other members of your group would look at you very strangely if you started talking like another group. So no, even if we can invent a language for everyone, it will not be adopted by everyone.",

        "a": "What are some legitimate reasons a cash buyer could delay a closing on a house? Among the possibilities: The cash buyer doesn\u2019t have the cash him/herself.  The buyer was planning to borrow the money from a hard money lender and, for any number of reasons, the money hasn\u2019t come through yet. The \u201ccash buyer\u201d really is wholesaling the property.  That is, he\u2019s putting it under contract, then assigning the contract. However, it\u2019s possible the wholesaler hasn\u2019t found anyone who wants the property. There\u2019s a problem with the home inspection.   Even cash buyers should have a home inspection contingency. There\u2019s a problem with the title.  It may be clouded in some fashion, and needs to be cleaned up before the sale can occur. The seller agreed to deliver the property vacant, but there\u2019s still a tenant in there.  (Usually, the tenant is entitled to remain in a property for the full term of his/her lease, even if the property is sold . . . unless the lease specifically addresses the sale of the property. In those cases, the seller often tries negotiating with the tenant\u2014\u201ccash for keys. But the tenant may say no, or may ask for more money in order to terminate the lease early.) If  the seller is obligated to perform certain actions (such as providing condo documents or HOA documents to the buyer) and hasn\u2019t done so yet,  the purchase agreement actually might become void. At the very least, this could delay closing until the required documents are provided. If there's an \"on or around about\" closing date, can a cash buyer delay a closing because he's having trouble getting all of the cash together... When there's an \"on or around date\" set for a house closing, can the buyer delay it by 60-90 days due to financial problems? Do house buyers keep the home staging items? What are some good tips for first time house buyers? I live in Orlando. For some reason, I have to buy my father's house. Is there any home buyer in Orlando? Usually it's financing related when underwriting comes back with certain conditions that must first be satisfied before closing the loan. When issues arise during the transaction, both agents work together with their client to extend and resolve items should more time be needed than the original contract outlined. You might've heard the term, \u201ctime is of the essence.\u201d Well in a real estate transaction, these different dates and deadlines are critical to ensuring a smooth transaction and ultimately what gets everyone to the closing table. If a date passes without a resolution, the party loses that right and the transaction either moves forward onto the next contingency or in some cases, if both sides cannot mutually agree on something by the specified date for example, the contract becomes void and is no longer a valid, legally enforceable agreement. Most of the time both parties act in good faith since it is in everyone's best interest to keep the deal together and is generally preferred to amend/extend rather than terminating and restarting the process from scratch which can be both costly and time consuming when you consider now that EVERYONE is basically restarting the whole process over from beginning; putting the home back on the market, finding a qualified buyer whose loan will close, the Buyer now needing to find another home, and essentially going through everything else over again. In some instances if the Buyer used FHA financing and is forced to terminate the contract there are additional negative implications to the Seller now (in Colorado at least) because going forward, should the Seller put the home back on the market, FHA guidelines require that that FHA appraisal valuation remains with the home for 6 months, which in turns lowers the Sellers negotiating power and leverage since they can't justify a higher asking price because the appraisal valuation remains and is disclosed to future potential Buyers. The loan objection deadline is usually the last recourse for your buyer before the closing date to terminate should some financing related issue come up and it is their last chance of having their earnest money returned. There are a number of other reasons for amending the original purchase agreement to extend dates or make changes (inspection and appraisal are among the biggest negotiating points and parts of the transaction between the parties should there be an appraisal discrepancy, or if the Buyer & Seller can't agree on repairs after inspection, for example. The \u201con or before\u201d term is generally used when both parties first agree to the extension, and then should whatever issue there was be resolved sooner than both parties originally may have anticipated, the Buyer & Seller can agree to close on an earlier date. The term \u201clegitimate\u201d itself would need more analysis. In Colorado where I work, closing dates are firm and contractual unless both parties agree to an extension. There are times when practicality supersedes the letter of the contract and the parties will agree to an extension even if they don\u2019t want to. For example, in recent years we have had significant issues with appraisal delays due to appraiser shortages. We have had to extend many contracts to provide more time for appraisals to be completed. Nobody likes it, but if the seller wants to sell and the buyer wants to buy, we extend the contract to keep the transaction together. Same for loan processing/approval delays, funding delays, and other delays beyond the control of either party. Many delays and issues are actually within the control of one or both parties, with a little anticipation and pro-active approach. So we have to be careful when asking for extensions because if the other party perceives that the problem could have been prevented with proper planning, they may or may not agree to extend and many buyers have lost their property of choice because a seller refused to extend the appraisal, loan, closing, or other dates in the contract. Most times because there\u2019s a mortgage delay of some kind, a credit issue needing fixing, a co-signer problem, a title search matter, an old property lien found, a hesitancy/problem on the buyers buyer of their home which has to be closed prior to your closing, etc. Mostly though, the \u2018on or around date\u2019 is really just a legal way to extend time IF needing it without an automatic cancel of agreement.

        "a": "Go back in time ten years. That\u2019s when oil prices were high and there were lots of jobs in oil and gas firms. IT efficiency was a bit of a joke because its cost compared to the oil fields was negligible. Globally the oil and gas industry is in a serious cost-cutting mode. That includes outsourcing most of their IT, which isn\u2019t their core competency, to firms such as IBM and Accenture, who have significant numbers of their resources offshore. Oil towns like Houston and Calgary that used to have a lot of jobs going begging for people now have empty office towers. And those jobs aren\u2019t coming back. Structurally, oil and gas is challenged by multiple different factors which mean that it\u2019s in its end game: Climate change  - governments globally have realized that they have to get off the fossil fuel addiction. This is leading to policy and taxation changes which are no longer nearly as supportive of oil and gas expansion, and policy changes which support fossil-fuel free alternatives such as wind, solar and electric cars. Pollution  - While the developed world has mostly cleaned up its air compared to the bad old days of the 1960s, the developing world mostly repeated the same mistakes and are now suffering the same consequences of citizens who are refusing to accept their kids choking with asthma and their parents wheezing in their beds. Innovation  - Unconventional oil and gas extraction like fracking and EOR are technologies which spread easily around the world and are increasing supply. Increased supply reduces price. Efficiency  - The things which consume oil and gas just keep getting more efficient at eking the finite amount of energy out of it. That keeps the curve flatter. Electric cars  - Emerging now is the long term threat that electric cars are going to kill oil expanded demand, and in fact shrink it. Everyone is in agreement that this is going to happen in the next few decades, but projections of when are all over the map. But investment in major oil fields is a decades-long investment, so the projections of 13 years out put a big chill on oil field exploration and expansion. Wind and solar are cheap  - Natural gas killed coal and nuclear. Now wind and solar are as cheap or cheaper and are killing natural gas. It has maybe a decade or two of expansion, and that\u2019s a pretty obvious trend. If you are starting a career, oil and gas isn\u2019t where to start it. If you are in IT, oil and gas aren\u2019t the places to get jobs. Like my content? Help it spread via  Patreon . Get confidential consulting via  OnFrontiers .  Email me  if you\u2019d like me to write for you. Where can I find a job for an oil and gas company in the UAE? How do I get an oil and gas job in UAE from India? What is the best way to getting a job at an oil and gas company? How do I get a job in oil and gas sectors? How can I get an oil and gas sector job in Australia? Go on the websites of the major companies such as Exxon, Chevron, Shell and search for computer science just like I did below\u2026. You need absolutely nothing in the way of anything different to get into an oil and gas company other than find one who is hiring and having the skill set required to do the job. Look are for IT jobs in Houston TX, If you want to see how many IT positions are available in that sector. The last company I worked for was an global oil and gas company looking for a Sr Infrastructure Engineer, I had a phone interview with the director, a face to face interview the following day with him and his team, had a verbal offer the following day. They were a platform company and owned about 40 other companies including the one who capped the BP oil spill in the gulf. There are so many job in that sector in Houston I was turning down 7\u201310 offers a month for a while, but be very aware if the price of oil drops from $80 dollars a barrel to $30, people lose their jobs by the 10\u2019s of thousands.",

As for the aid, we survived during sanctions, there was no aid then. Many of the politicians are calling for a refusal to take aid. I too am against taking aid from any country. If only we could get rid of the political dynasties we could actually thrive better. The only thing that has us in a mess is this aid. It doesn't even serve us and yet we tend to take it. History might forgive many people but never the political elite of Pakistan nor those who vote for them. Are the Pakistani people physically strong? What do Iranians think about Pakistanis? What do the US and developed countries think about Pakistan? Pakistan: Why do so many people think we Pakistanis are Middle Eastern? What do Pakistanis think of Zaid Hamid? Because it won't collapse, pakistan can survive on its own. If it's not for the corruption pakistan don't even need any us or any other aid. The aid pakistan receives in name of military aid is peanuts to what pakistan army had spent in the name of war on terror, as a matter of fact there's still money which us owe to pakistan armed forces to balance the sheets but it still is fighting no matter what. So the army won't collapse but the corrupt politicians would definitely collapse if we pakistan stop getting foreign aid. What American aid we are talking about here? As far as i know buying equipment is not count as aid. Well there is another miss-concept here that Pakistan have been supporting NATO and US force which in return they compensate them which many of people think of it as AID. Another thing is Pakistan was in under sanction in 1999 and forward for few years and faced global ban and they survive it with no much hurdle. I am still thinking of which support you are talking about but for sake of question lets suppose there is one then they can handle quite well because Pakistan have a good friend in form China and newly growing good relation with Russia too. Its a fashion in Pakistan to lie and lie in unison. Since reality is too hard for them to accept and be proud so they prefer to live in dreams and feel proud in dreams. The aid which Pakistan gets is more like a compensation for the suffering due to taking the side of America after 9/11. If you are getting your information from Indian media then remember that their narrative is highly biased. Off-course Pakistani military can survive without taking aid from any country. Americans give the aid to our military because they are doing what America wants. Pakistanis are generally against taking aid from any country and then working for them . But as you know the world we live in has some big boys and those big boys are the care takers of the world. We have to listen to them. There were no blasts in Pakistan before 9/11 or more correctly when America attacked Afghanistan. It would be too stupid to think Pakistan suffering in war on terror and no country which want Pakistan to fight helping Pakistan.",

Vast majority of Indians on Quora are Males (sexually frustrated teenage and young men below 30 who never had any sexual exposure :) 4. All of a sudden they get to read detailed (Read: titillating) sexual encounters of  escort  girls and sexually liberated women and they get sexually aroused :) 5. Then a lady by the name  Sal Rose  comes on Quora and starts sharing her  gangbang  experiences and get lapped up by perverts :) The funny thing is most Indian men would mistake a Japanese for a Western woman but does that matter? Not till they get to read lascivious stuff (and that through women) for free ;) Why are my questions not answered on Quora? Is it possible to get notified about every new question posted in some of the topics of Quora via e-mail? Why do some people ask questions on Quora that could easily be answered by using a search engine? Why is every third question on Quora is related to sex? How can I make it better? Why do people answer questions on Quora? Indian male here\u2026 so, I guess I qualify to answer. Indians have been known for their sex and sexual traditions since centuries\u2026 we actually wrote the book of love, Kamasutra. As Indians sex was never considered taboo or dirty, rather it was celebrated and infact we have monuments depicting sexual \u200bintercourse, some of our religious text mention it as a holy rite!! Then came the British\u2026 and they forced the Victorian mindset on us. So in a matter of 150 odd years of their rule, it was imbibed on us that sex is sin, and talking or practising sex openly (read outside of marriage) was considered a crime. Now, this is human tendency\u2026 the more you try to suppress anything, the more it will burst open or resist. Till the advent of internet, sex was not easily accessible in India. Not in the movies or magazines or even Sex education. Not even a lip kiss or french kiss!! So the population was hungry, almost ravenous\u2026 On the other hand, the western world was more forthcoming and open on matters of sex\u2026 thanks to the seventies (hippie movement) or the McKinsey report of the US. So, sex was casually depicted in movies and magazines as well\u2026thank you, Hugh Hefner :) Now, thanks to the internet and the uncensored and free content available on tubesites, we are trying to make up for the lost time\u2026 literally!! I, myself, follow you, Laurie, Anna, Alice and your post appear automatically on my feed. Call me curious, perverted or a prude, I can't stop myself from reading them, as I am sure you won't be quoting verses from the Bible :D Ohh\u2026 did I mention, I also jump on posts talking about gyms and workouts, astronomy, physics, mathematics, comic books, philosophy\u2026there is no end, and that\u2019s what really pulls me to Quora (where else would I go, I have no facebook or instagram or Tinder or anything social\u2026bummer) I am pretty much sure that many of my fellow Indians would agree with me. Those who don't\u2026 well, they are acting like a true Indian\u2026 calling it a sacrilege but yearning for it from within. With love and respect from an (horny, perverted, prude, creep, stalker, _____ add adjective(s) of your choice) Indian.

        "a": "On the contrary, Vietnam is one of Russia's strategic pivots to Asia with others being China and India. This is exemplified in the fact that our country successfully negotiated the first external FTA with the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). The agreement signed in 2015 promise to boost trade between Eurasia and Vietnam from the 4 billion USD in 2016 to 10 billion USD in 2020. Russia in particular plans to sell technology, mineral resources and cars to Vietnam. In turn, our nation will benefit from new market for export of agricultural, aquacultural products and textiles. The list of cooperation between Russia and Vietnam can go on and on with energy sector, telecommunication and most importantly military. We are after all comrades of the same ideology. Why does Taiwan invest so heavily in Vietnam when Vietnam doesn't even recognize Taiwan as a country? How come Russia doesn't sell any of its cars in USA? Why doesn't the United States invite Russia to join NATO? What do you think about Russia? What form of military aid did US provide to south Vietnam before signing the gulf of Tonkin resolution and what were the restrictions of this ... As a rule, we shouldn\u2019t expect governments to do logical things or act in ways that make sense from either a humanitarian or a practical standpoint. For example, instead of developing its infrastructure for the last 15 years, the US has been massively involved in unnecessary and suicidal wars. Similarly, the US government has for 50 years missed a great opportunity by not investing in Latin America. In short, we have to get over the tendency to ascribe to government properties of individuals. We think ethically. Governments do not think at all. They are, to a large extent, terrible, impersonal machines that work for special interests and manifest the collective dark side of citizens. Perhaps the real issue is how to get foreign individuals and corporations \u2014 not governments \u2014 to invest in Vietnamese businesses and infrastructure. As far as I informed we do invest in Vietnam. For example one mobile phone operator in Vietnam belongs to Russian operator MTS. They probably do, but not on, like, a large scale. Also, we are doing pretty well; although unemployment, high mortality rate and poverty might still be a problem, they are some of the things that are not worth it for Russia to invest into, they have priorities too, you know.",

I\u2019ve known medical residents who, after a long night on call and working the following day, enjoyed exercise as a way to \u201cde-stress.\u201d As to the type, time, or amount of exercise, you\u2019ll have to determine that for yourself. Why do I feel tired and lazy to go to work everyday? Why do I feel more tired after a two-hour nap? Is it normal to feel tired after a 15-minute fitness exercise? Why do I feel tired after emptying my bowel? I feel tired and dizzy after running in an empty stomach early in the morning. What should I do? It is almost always good to exercise. You will never NOT feel \u201ctired and lazy after work\u201d until you start exercising, and you will never start exercising if you wait until some time when you don\u2019t feel tired and lazy. If running is your preferred form of exercise, then run. Run till you get back to where you started. If you don\u2019t like running, do something else. As an old, fat, healthcare provider I have to say the recommendation is to walk briskly, not to run. Running regularly will give you heart healthy benefits, but you will need knee replacement surgery when you are in your sixties. Walking briskly for 20 minutes five times a week is an excellent heart healthy exercise that will give you the same benefit as running, but it will save your knees. I see this line of thought quite a bit with wannabe novelists. They feel like they can't get in the  zone  and so wait to feel inspired, and wait, and wait. And so they remain wannabe writers. You need discipline, not inspiration. Once you do something for a few weeks, it becomes a habit, and you'll feel off if you  don\u2019t  get to it. You don't look for inspiration to brush your teeth, right? The same applies here. Go for a run tomorrow. Then the day after that. You'll soon have more energy than you've felt since you were a little kid, but your body won't pump you up until you give it a reason. Consistency is key, in this as in everything. Good luck :)",

        "a": "Interesting, I have missed much about this study! It seems that it was not a development project but rather a research project concerning what characteristics a future generation of fighters should have done by SAAB. Apparently SAAB wanted other nations like South Korea and Turkey to join the study. I have seen claims that in a way the Gripen E fulfils some of the alternatives in the study. Reading some papers from the Swedish defence department (in Swedish at  http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sit... ) is seems that the project has been replaced by a new study called \u201cFlygsystem 2025\u201d that is targeting 2040 and beyond (the 2025 being the year that a concept development would need to be initiated). Speculation is that we are not looking at an fully autonomous fighter but autonomy is in the scope as an option. What is known about Titan Aerospace? Should the USAF make a stealth tanker? How much of the ocean does a USN carrier battle group occupy? During WWII, the B-24 Liberator was by far the most-produced Allied aircraft. It flew faster and farther than the B-17 with twice the payload,... How do fighter pilots typically earn their call signs? The format of the name* makes me think this is not a project to develop an aircraft, but rather a project of \u201cStrategic Outlook\u201d-type. The Swedish armed forces and the swedish armament industry usually have projects running named by a type of equipment and a year 20\u201340 years in the future. E. g. \u201cRPAS f\u00f6r territorial\u00f6vervakning 2030\u2033, \u201cStridsvagn 2000\u201d These projects serve as knowledge bases of a subject, keeping abreast of changing technology and adapting old plans so they stay relevant, and are not necessarily R&D-projects, but rather serve as \u201cMarket Research\u201d determining what the armed forces need, and what the industry is capable of producing. I could be wrong though, and some of the projects I know of did (\u201cStridsfordon 90\u201d et. al.) result in development of new products. *Flygsystem does not mean aircraft but rather \u201cFlying system\u201d which would mean not only an aircraft, but aircraft, spare parts, logistics, hangars and so on and so forth. Very little is publicly known and it will be some time before much detail comes to light. From the concept art produced SAAB haven\u2019t even finally decided the aircraft\u2019s wing shape, because I have seen several different designs in SAAB images. When they do decide they won\u2019t release any real detail, only images that show in a general way what the plane looks like. Since the principles of stealth are now so well known it is likely that the shape won\u2019t be a secret but a lot of information on the aircraft will be classified. This means that only air forces that buy the plane will know all that it can do. It will need to be a networked plane and will be highly agile so it can dogfight. It will also feature good BVR capability and probably all-round IR sensor equipment similar to the DAS on board the F-35. It is almost certain that it will be designed to operate from austere strips, stretches of public road with mobile maintenance vehicles, so it can operate in Sweden even if the airfields are bombed. This is a standard requirement for the Swedish Air Force and even if it isn\u2019t a firm requirement for an export customer it is still a worthwhile attribute that has helped to sell the Gripen. Any fighter produced by SAAB should be taken very seriously, they always represent superb value for money and perform well, outperforming aircraft with much higher price tags. So one thing you can be certain of is that if development is funded the aircraft will be superb.",

        "a": "If you mean in Plato\u2019s  Republic , then you do, because Plato is really talking about inner philosopher kings who rule the city of your mind. The Republic: Plato\u2019s Allegory for the Human Soul Which philosopher has actually affected the way you act in life? Is God a philosophical construct? Who is the greatest philosopher of all time? What makes one a philosopher? What is a product philosopher? The biggest things would be for example: Having widely read publications in academic philosophy. This often involves having a new idea in the evolution of philosophy that you discuss to death. To some extent, earning a PhD in philosophy counts, but this doesn't automatically make you famous. Teaching philosophy courses at a major university might count, but this doesn't always make you the greatest of the great in your generation. Being remembered for a major work or movement might count. For example, Wittgenstein is remembered for the Tractatus and his Later Period even though he taught grade school. Lao Tzu is remembered for Taoism primarily because his Tao Te Ching survived numerous book burnings. Solving or more likely posing a major problem in a way that can be accepted might count. For example, Searl' s Chinese Room and Russell's Paradox contributed to John Searl and Bertrand Russell's fame. Traditionally, posing an important question might make someone famous if they were already known as a philosopher: here are some questions with the philosophers who may have asked them:  The Dialectic of Philosophy (Philosophy's Most Important Questions) I have noticed the success of a great philosophical idea is often preceded by a \u2018trough of ignorance\u2019 in which similar ideas are considered ridiculous. Then the new idea seems novel, and therefore worth studying, because of a phenomena I call 'philosophical exhaustion\u2019. Philosophical exhaustion contributes not only to novelty, but also to the comparative acceptability of ideas: the ideas to which a concept or system is compared. Keep in mind there are generally only one or two major philosophers per generation, counting PhDs. And, responding to important ideas like these  Programmable Heuristics  can be a kingmaker in the long term, if the ideas you respond to are important enough, and if your response is important enough. I feel very important. If I assume I'm important, future philosophers will have a tough time: A choice between elaborating coherence or proposing an alternate coherent system. Philosophical computing (omniscience, applied knowledge). Analyzing the formula for souls. Finding out what psychic prediction means for philosophy. Finding the objective symbolic meaning of creativity. Finding technical philosophical solutions to problems based on the general Paroxysm, or new heuristics. There are also a few other areas that are more traditional (now): Dimensionality / Philosophy of physics / metaphysics. Ethics and applied fields (philosophy of race, political philosophy). Religious philosophy.

        "a": "Do not ruin the magic of your first Disney World experience by marrying yourself to a specific vision of what you will do and how it will be. I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that very few people come back from Disney World and say: \u201cEh, it wasn\u2019t all that. I really don\u2019t see what the fuss is about.\u201d However, I think it can be a pretty common experience for newbies to read blogs, buy books, listen to their friends\u2019 must-do recommendations, and build themselves an expectation that it is impossible for reality to live up to. This might apply to the whole trip, or more commonly to particular experiences such as a character meal or a trip to Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique. They still have a great time in the end, but the special dinner or activity that they planned is marred from what it could have been by their [temporary] disillusionment that the expectation didn\u2019t match up to reality. Or, they read that planning is essential to a successful trip to Disney World, and they make a great master plan, and then they  stick to that plan, goshdarnit,  even when they see things that they might want to do that aren\u2019t in the plan \u2014 and that they might prefer to the things that are in the plan \u2014 because  this is the plan.  I know, it sounds really silly when I put it that way, but people do do this, even sensible people. They get caught up in the amount of effort that went into preparation, and forget that in the end it is satisfaction with the experience that should be the metric and not how well you stuck to the plan. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I\u2019m not saying not to plan. I do think it\u2019s possible to have a terrific first trip without any planning, as long as you take the attitude that you will be thrilled with everything that you are doing and shake off anything that you find is unattainable due to lack of planning. But a little planning can go a looong way, even if it is just looking up the most popular rides in each park and making Fastpasses for those in advance. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that planning is a way to build anticipation, and for many people anticipation is part of the enjoyment of a vacation. So keeping that in mind, here are my recommendations for how to plan and anticipate your first trip: Take the measure of yourself and use resources that are available to decide how much planning is right for you and that you know the areas where planning can have the maximum effect. Keep in mind that one person\u2019s must-do is another person\u2019s totally missable experience. Of course you should listen to other people\u2019s recommendations, but with the following caveats: This might be something that sounds like fun to  them , but from listening to their rough description, does it sound like fun  to you? Even if you decide to do it, remember that you may not have the same experience they did. Keep in mind that there is absolutely no way that you will be able to do all the things that people will tell you that you must do while you are at Disney World. It would be like trying to eat at every restaurant that serves a wonderful pasta dish on a trip to Rome. Don\u2019t stress yourself out by trying to cram in as many must-do\u2019s as you possibly can, instead pick just a few and make sure to enjoy them to the hilt. Quality over quantity. Keep in mind that planning for logistics can have as much or more value than planning specific activities \u2014 not bringing the right clothing so that you end up hot, sweaty, and miserable can affect your trip to a far greater extent than simply finding that Space Mountain is closed on the day you are visiting the Magic Kingdom. Blogs can help a lot with this, and I wrote an answer here that you may find useful as well:  Jennifer Edeburn's answer to What are some tips for parents to survive a long day at Disney World? Finally, after you\u2019ve done some planning and moved on to the anticipation, don\u2019t make your daydreams too detailed. Instead of focusing on a specific vision of how a particular experience will go, focus on your excitement over the newness of it, your anticipation of an event that is partly a mystery. If your only high expectation is that whatever you are trying will be fun and enjoyable, it is usual that Disney does not disappoint. What are some tips for visiting Disney World? What are the best days to visit Disney World? Why are those days ideal? What is the best meal you had at Walt Disney World? Can you buy tickets to Disney World from Costco? What is the best ride at Disneyland or Walt Disney World? Read all the resources you can before going. Work with an authorized Disney travel agent\u2026they can help guide you through the do\u2019s and don\u2019t and give you good advice on what to do, the best rates, where to stay, dine, etc. Check out  http://magicguides.com/disney-wo...  and other pages to get you started.

        "a": "This question goes to the roots of trigonometry itself, before the abstractness and craziness of complex trig functions and calculus come in. What is the value cosine of x really mean. It, before the graphs and the unit circle, simply meant to be a ratio- a ratio between the size of the adjacent side to angle x of a right triangle and the size of the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Or, as taught in high school trig classes,  adjacent/hypotenuse . Now what does this value cosine of x approach as we bring the value of x closer and closer to 0? The lines become parallel to each other, and slowly converge onto 1 line. They have the same length now, thus the ratio turns out to be 1. Therefore, the value of cos(0)=1. Or you could just look at the graph and not worry about this stuff- cos x - Google Search How can  [math]2^{2^{2^{2^0}}}[/math]  not equal 1? What is 0\u00d70\u00d70\u00d70\u00d70\u00d70\u00d70\u00d70=? How many zeros are in 3? How a raise to 0 equal to 1? How can we prove that 0/0 = 2? It is the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle after a 0-radian rotation (counterclockwise) from the positive x-axis (right). Since there has been zero rotation, the point on the circle is still also on the x-axis. The unit circle has radius 1, by definition, so cos(0) = 1. Thanks! There are many ways to think of it but the most  intuitive  is by thinking of a  Unit   Circle. If you haven't heard of them, don\u2019t worry! They are not some alien concept. A  unit circle  is just a circle having radius = 1 unit(any unit of your choice; cm, m or whatever). Now,  think  of a unit circle centred at the origin and then draw a radius making any angle with the positive direction of x-axis. Now you can think of  Cosine  of your angle as the  projection  of the radius on the x-axis. Now, when the angle is 0, the  cosine  will  be the  radius  itself  on the x-axis, and as we know will be 1 unit long (  coincidentally,   it is also the maximum cosine can be, and its clear to see it from the circle because the projection for any angle in the circle cannot be greater than the radius of the circle). Therefore, cos 0 = 1. Below is the  khanacademy  link where you  will  get to know the intuition about the other trigonometric ratios like sin & tan too, apart from getting detailed information about this. Good Luck\u263a. Unit circle The ratio cos equals base \u00f7 hypotenuse. Now, in a right angled triangle if you make the base angle 0, then effectively the hypotenuse collapses onto the base, and becomes the same height. So, the ratio of their heights becomes 1. Therefore, cos(0) = 1 Hope that helps!",

        "a": "Like its other 7 siblings, Assam is very backward. Although it has strategic and resources advantage, the corruption and lethargy are to be blamed. The North East fares soo well in the HDI and literacy but fails to turn it to development and growth. According to a study, at least 40% of the government projects are channelled to the corrupt officials. The North East is poorly connected by road, air and even digitally. The quality of education is poor. It is mainly bookish and not practical. The bureaucrats feel isolated and their enthusiasm waters down after few futile attempts and resort to corruption.. Being less populous the states have very less representation in the Parliament and so mostly they are unheard. Even though they get assistance from the center, most of it is diverted or misutilized. They are wholly integrated with India as there exist some resistance in the minds of some Indian. The resource tapping is hindered by the forest policies or people. The migration from the neighbourhood is also a major demographic problem. The unrest and unresolved territorial claims are a concern. Last but not the least, the standard time is also causing delays. The daylight saving is impossible as India wholly follows IST which is about one hour different from the mainland. Thus North East is backward and not connected digitally. The change has to come from the people. The proper leadership and inclusive development and citizen participation and peaceful arbitration of the issues will give very much appreciated returns sooner than later. So instead of blaming, people have the opportunity to be the change. All the best. Why is Odisha a backward state? Who is the richest man in Assam? What kept Pakistan from developing at the same pace as India? What is capital of Assam? Which city do you think is still backwards in India, and why? Depends on what your definition of backwardness is. If lacking a govt. email ID - or let me use a broader term - a fully functional e-governance system - is a sign of backwardness, then most govt. offices and staff all over India are backward, not only Assam. When it comes to infrastructure - road, train, air, or other such amenities that depends on central govt grant, Assam and the other N-E states used to be \u201cneglected\u201d by mainstream India and central govt in spite of being a huge source of revenue from petroleum, tea and many other natural resources, although now it is changing. Otherwise, if we consider education, social system, women empowerment, communal harmony, tolerance, fashion, literature, art, culture etc, most of the N-E states are way more advanced than many other Indian states or nations and in certain areas they can serve as role models for them. For example, concepts like dowry, honor killing rampant in all over India are foreign to the North-East states in India - beat that. Asaam is so backward? A paper work getting delayed, not using letterhead and not having a valid email id seems very strong reasons to tell it a backward state. Now let me give you some glimpse of our backwardness. The gateway to North-EAST starts from the same backward state. Even today we don't take dowry and rated in the list of one the most safest and respectful place for girls in the entire India. In spite of having the greatest diversities in the enthic origin of the people, we still strive to stay in harmony and peace. People ditch their homeland after using the same scholarship benefits given to them by the state government. They even try to belittle their homeland still people like Jadev Payeng, Papon are striving hard to make the state proud. Assam host the first place in the entire Asia to have discovered oil and use the cable run drilling technology. There isn't any state in the country where the lack of proper facilities is not a problem. It's not the fault of the State, It's the fault of people like us who don't know how to use the complains nd suggestions box in the office or talk to the higher authority to resolve the issue. I AM A PROUD ASSAMESE GUY. I HAVE DONE MY BITS OF TEACHING MY YOUNGER GENERATION TO SHOW SOME RESPECT TO THEIR HOMELAND. HAVE YOU? Assam is backward because of the political leaders of India who never gave any importance to the area as they thought it a region of tribal. British came to Bengal in 1757, developed Bengal keeping the region as Bongo-Bihar-Orissa. Education and culture came to Bengal and other regions but not to the Eastern regions of India (Undivided Assam). It was under Burmese army. It was Maniram Dewan of Assam, who took the help of British to get rid off of Burmese and developed the Tea garden. At the beginning of British administration it was under the command of Bengalis, who neglected the area and later after 1947, it was neglected by the Delhi Government, rather divided Assam into several states destroyed the unity and the economy. Otherwise it was a gate way to the East towards South East Asia as Bombay is the gateway to the West.",

Some scientists actually fantasize about phonons and neuronal membranes*, but the problem here is that the brain is a big blob of gelatinous goo. When you see Japanese Taiko drummers**, you'll notice they're not using brains on stage. That's because gelatinous goo dampens vibrations. So nope, the brain doesn't emit  neuronal  noise. It does emit vascular noises related to the heartbeat and circulation. That reflects the hydrodynamic power involved and the proximity of large blood vessels to the skull. Some comments: Brains are not electromagnetic. As already noted, they're electrochemical. The meme that they work on electricity mostly confuses people and leads to all sorts of \u201cbrainwave transmission\u201d nonsense. Electronics and computer analogies have some heuristic value, but they're not particularly descriptive. Individual neurons don't \u201cwork\u201d at \u201cextremely low frequency.\u201d They fire off the occasional action potential at rates of a few per second, but they're always squirting various goobers at each other and writhing their axon terminals and dendritic filopodia about. * A proposed dynamic mechanism of nerve action potential. ** What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain? How many brain cells are killed during a CT scan? Does the human heart have brain cells in it? Does sneezing kill brain cells? Is every cell division controlled by human brain? You are mixing every damn thing(electromagnetic waves and sound waves) up.Nope, nothing ever comes out of the brain( sound waves especially). Sound waves are variations in the layers of medium/air for now. These variations are in the form of rarefaction(less air) and compression(more air layers).  IT NEEDS A MEDIUM. IT IS A PHYSICAL ENTITY. Electromagnetic waves are a combination of electric and magnetic field which occur due to the other. These hit solidly and transfer energy in E=hv, when the object they hit has electrons which need exactly the provided energy.  The electric field hits at all the other other times-when the energy can\u2019t be taken by the electrons-this effect causes current in the antennas and these are amplified and decoded causing all sorts of information to be encoded and decoded((0 and 1)s).these are applied to speakers to cause sound waves. So, please understand physics. It\u2019s fun. and you can make a speaker/radio from just these basics, plus some electronics. Note: Please feel free to suggest any mistakes. No. The brain is not an electromagnetic organ; it is an  electrochemical  organ. It works by means of ion fluxes through gated ion channels.

Cheers, Mr. President! How would you say Donald Trump is doing as President so far? What grade would you give him? If you could limit President Trump to 4 words tomorrow, what 4 words would you have him say? How will the anti-Trump liberals react, if President Trump turns the nation around for the better, and they can't say, \"I told you so\"? Is Donald Trump trolling or does he really believe in his own rhetoric? Is he punking us? Is he just saying stuff to get elected? What are the chances of Donald Trump's impeachment? Think before you do or pay consequences. Trump needs to learn that just because he is the president and has been sucking on a silver spoon his whole life does not mean that he is above everyone else. Whether he agrees or not, we are all human beings and we are all equal. Before making deals with Russia, he should've thought that in such an advanced technological age, where everything I say and do as president (recorded) or before can be found, should I really do such a thing? Should I lie that I respect women when I've clearly done (and been recorded) doing nothing of the sort? If he was such a great business man than he would\u2019ve learned this truth a long time ago, but then again he has gone bankrupt multiple times, so I guess he's not as good as he claims to be\u2026. what else is new?

I would encourage him to be open minded about what people want, why they are protesting, listen to their concerns, and what issues are important to them. By surrounding himself with billionaires, he only hears what he can do to make them happy. But half of the population is poor. And millions are one paycheck away from homelessness.

        "a": "It would be utterly difficult to generalise the answer for entire youth of India. Hence, I will just tell about  my favorite Indian authors . (in no particular order) Rohinton Mistry A master storyteller who seldom goes into literary rhetorics, very effective in creating pathos with simple words. He had written 3 books and one short story series, all the 3 books were nominated for Booker prize (yes all the 3 books). His best noted book was  A Fine Balance (Indian Novel) by Rohinton Mistry  which was publicly Burnt by Shiv Sena people due to its depiction of Sena in negative lights. Whatever he stood resilient and I think he is a gentleman. Also he eschews limelight and its very rare to see him in an interview. truly a master. Amitav Ghosh A literary giant who writes great historical fiction and that too about South east asia and subcontinental culture. I loved his  The Glass Palace  and  The Calcutta Chromosome by Amitav Ghosh . Also Ghosh is very consistent with his work and he writes regularly. He also had written few good non-fictions. A good for the next booker prize from India. Also the man is great orator. Ruskin Bond A master of short story as well as novels, ruskin bond is the quintessential author from the Hills. I read his recently released collection of Fiction and nonfiction in  The Writer on the Hill , it was amazing. Also his love for Mussorie is commendable & deserves respect. Vikram Seth An all-rounder, his works span poems, Novels, non-fiction, long poems and what not. I has first read his  The Frog And The Nightingale Poem by Vikram Seth - Poemhunter  at Class X and I was instantly hooked to his narration. I waiting eagerly to read his travelogue  From Heaven Lake  . He is an inspiration. Jhumpa Lahiri The Namesake  and  The Lowland (2013 book)  , two great books. Great narrative style. An international presence. Definitely in the list. Amish Tripathi With his  The Shiva Trilogy  he demonstrated his ability to write great historical fictions that too based on detailed research and analysis. Also his ongoing  Ramchandra Series  Also looks good. He may not have literary skills similar to Vikram seth or amitav ghosh but he is definitely very effective in story-telling and doing an astounding amount of research. Anita Desai (the mother of Kiran Desai) Very prolific writer of the 70s, 80s & 90s. Nominated thrice for booker prize. I loved her  Fire on the Mountain  and a short story ( I just can\u2019t remember the name but it was great). Certainly one of my favorites. Chetan Bhagat Ya last but not the least CB. You are all familiar with him, yes his current works may not be as good as his first i.e.  Five Point Someone  or  Two States (2009 book)  and obviously in terms of literary merit he ranks much lower than the rest on this list. But one cannot deny that he was the  one who introduced the next gen to reading  it's because of him only I started exploring other authors and eventually I am reading authors who have won Nobel prizes and whole great stature. Currently I don\u2019t hold much expectation to him but still whenever his new book is released I do inquire about it and its rating/reviews. I last read his  Half Girlfriend (2014 book)  and yeahh it was terrible. Thus it was all from my side on my current favorite Indian authors. All the best and Enjoy reading !!!",

How held his childhood belief that humans should be interplanetary species. His company Tesla is a revolution in the automobile market with the latest Tesla Model making an impression all across the globe. Hyperloop, one of his other pet projects is planning to launch its services in India. SpaceX is one of the first private players to commercially launch a spaceship and have achieved something which only the people with government support have done. The Kaoboys of R&AW by B Raman. This book provides a first of its kind insight into the Indian Intelligence Service. The ups and downs of the Research and Analysis Wing during the regime of different governments and under the stewardship of different Prime Ministers. Shoe Dog by Phil Knight - This book is like an autobiography about the founder of the famous brand Nike. It talks about how Knight starts trading under a company \u2018Blue Ribbon\u2019 which almost gets bankrupted and how he manages to synchronise the outstanding creditors and investors. Phil Knight is a media shy person and doesn\u2019t appear in front of the camera that often. Einstein : His life and Universe by Walter Issacson - This book is all about Albert Einstein and how he became the world\u2019s renowned physicist with his quantum theory and other path-breaking inventions and research paper. I am currently reading, From Third World to First (Singapore and the Asian Economic boom) by Lee Kuan Yew. This book talks about a tiny colony smaller than the size of the Indian state of Kerela escaped communism and fought back for its sovereign integrity. It is a book about the growth and development of Singapore. What are the most important books for startup founders to read? What do Pakistani youths think about India? How do I read the India yearbook effectively? What is the best book series in India to read? How many books do you read in a year and what is your goal in 2017? Right now i am reading  hatching twitter by  nick bilton  it\u2019s a book that covers how odeo (now twitter) evolved from a mess to 15B$ social media platform. It\u2019s a book that covers all the drama , conflicts, struggles of the 4 founders of twitter A worth reading for those who uses Twitter who is interested in Twitter\u2019s impact and origins who works in a start-up Anyone interested in the dangers of mixing business and friendship.",

        "a": "What are some legitimate reasons a cash buyer could delay a closing on a house? Among the possibilities: The cash buyer doesn\u2019t have the cash him/herself.  The buyer was planning to borrow the money from a hard money lender and, for any number of reasons, the money hasn\u2019t come through yet. The \u201ccash buyer\u201d really is wholesaling the property.  That is, he\u2019s putting it under contract, then assigning the contract. However, it\u2019s possible the wholesaler hasn\u2019t found anyone who wants the property. There\u2019s a problem with the home inspection.   Even cash buyers should have a home inspection contingency. There\u2019s a problem with the title.  It may be clouded in some fashion, and needs to be cleaned up before the sale can occur. The seller agreed to deliver the property vacant, but there\u2019s still a tenant in there.  (Usually, the tenant is entitled to remain in a property for the full term of his/her lease, even if the property is sold . . . unless the lease specifically addresses the sale of the property. In those cases, the seller often tries negotiating with the tenant\u2014\u201ccash for keys. But the tenant may say no, or may ask for more money in order to terminate the lease early.) If  the seller is obligated to perform certain actions (such as providing condo documents or HOA documents to the buyer) and hasn\u2019t done so yet,  the purchase agreement actually might become void. At the very least, this could delay closing until the required documents are provided. If there's an \"on or around about\" closing date, can a cash buyer delay a closing because he's having trouble getting all of the cash together... When there's an \"on or around date\" set for a house closing, can the buyer delay it by 60-90 days due to financial problems? Do house buyers keep the home staging items? What are some good tips for first time house buyers? I live in Orlando. For some reason, I have to buy my father's house. Is there any home buyer in Orlando? Usually it's financing related when underwriting comes back with certain conditions that must first be satisfied before closing the loan. When issues arise during the transaction, both agents work together with their client to extend and resolve items should more time be needed than the original contract outlined. You might've heard the term, \u201ctime is of the essence.\u201d Well in a real estate transaction, these different dates and deadlines are critical to ensuring a smooth transaction and ultimately what gets everyone to the closing table. If a date passes without a resolution, the party loses that right and the transaction either moves forward onto the next contingency or in some cases, if both sides cannot mutually agree on something by the specified date for example, the contract becomes void and is no longer a valid, legally enforceable agreement. Most of the time both parties act in good faith since it is in everyone's best interest to keep the deal together and is generally preferred to amend/extend rather than terminating and restarting the process from scratch which can be both costly and time consuming when you consider now that EVERYONE is basically restarting the whole process over from beginning; putting the home back on the market, finding a qualified buyer whose loan will close, the Buyer now needing to find another home, and essentially going through everything else over again. In some instances if the Buyer used FHA financing and is forced to terminate the contract there are additional negative implications to the Seller now (in Colorado at least) because going forward, should the Seller put the home back on the market, FHA guidelines require that that FHA appraisal valuation remains with the home for 6 months, which in turns lowers the Sellers negotiating power and leverage since they can't justify a higher asking price because the appraisal valuation remains and is disclosed to future potential Buyers. The loan objection deadline is usually the last recourse for your buyer before the closing date to terminate should some financing related issue come up and it is their last chance of having their earnest money returned. There are a number of other reasons for amending the original purchase agreement to extend dates or make changes (inspection and appraisal are among the biggest negotiating points and parts of the transaction between the parties should there be an appraisal discrepancy, or if the Buyer & Seller can't agree on repairs after inspection, for example. The \u201con or before\u201d term is generally used when both parties first agree to the extension, and then should whatever issue there was be resolved sooner than both parties originally may have anticipated, the Buyer & Seller can agree to close on an earlier date. The term \u201clegitimate\u201d itself would need more analysis. In Colorado where I work, closing dates are firm and contractual unless both parties agree to an extension. There are times when practicality supersedes the letter of the contract and the parties will agree to an extension even if they don\u2019t want to. For example, in recent years we have had significant issues with appraisal delays due to appraiser shortages. We have had to extend many contracts to provide more time for appraisals to be completed. Nobody likes it, but if the seller wants to sell and the buyer wants to buy, we extend the contract to keep the transaction together. Same for loan processing/approval delays, funding delays, and other delays beyond the control of either party. Many delays and issues are actually within the control of one or both parties, with a little anticipation and pro-active approach. So we have to be careful when asking for extensions because if the other party perceives that the problem could have been prevented with proper planning, they may or may not agree to extend and many buyers have lost their property of choice because a seller refused to extend the appraisal, loan, closing, or other dates in the contract. Most times because there\u2019s a mortgage delay of some kind, a credit issue needing fixing, a co-signer problem, a title search matter, an old property lien found, a hesitancy/problem on the buyers buyer of their home which has to be closed prior to your closing, etc. Mostly though, the \u2018on or around date\u2019 is really just a legal way to extend time IF needing it without an automatic cancel of agreement. A way to keep both buyer and seller locked into an agreement where otherwise it would have expired. A very dangerous clause as terms move from specifics to reasonable (of which everyone has a different opinion of what \u2018around\u2019 is).",

These figures can be used to INFER information such as: - Holdings in Corporations, Small Corporations (S-Corps), LLC\u2019s, and Partnerships. - Other sources of business income that may be conducted - Sources of investment income (Banks in which he deposits money or makes loans) - Sources of interest income (loans to related entities, or unrelated entities - as the case may be) - How much in charity he spends personally - may not indicate how charitable his businesses are depending on their own tax structure. - How much he spends in mortgage or investment interest - How much he spends on real estate taxes There\u2019s plenty of information in there, DEPENDING on how he has arranged all his various business interests. If they are separate legal entities, then those entities might be filing completely separate tax filings, in which case you may possibly need to examine the tax returns of possibly over 100 entities (a search of the New York Secretary of State database revealed over 100 entities that had the name Trump in their registered business name - this could indicate Donald, his family, or other non-related Trumps) ( Search Results ) You won\u2019t be able to see things such as balances of debt - you might be able to estimate based on interest expense - IF you can correctly estimate what interest rate he might pay. To summarize - Individual Income tax returns only show certain, specific items as they are necessary and required to prepare an accurate income tax return. They do NOT typically portray net worth, total assets, total liabilities, or the source of them. You may be able to estimate, guess, or infer certain information, and use the return to then determine where else you might look to put together a picture, but it won\u2019t do it by itself. As far as obtaining the return - I speculate the only way that his returns can be obtained by the Public in some manner are by coercion or convincing Trump it\u2019s in his best interest. The only way a prosecutor or some other investigating committee could obtain it is through congressional or other subpoena or warrant, and even then, they might NOT be allowed to release it publicly- AND they\u2019d have to have some suspicion of fraud or other illegal activity (some sort of reasonable cause) to ask for it in the first place. Trump certainly has enough lawyers at his disposal to fight such a subpoena for some time. Otherwise, it would be considered an invasion of private information. Until Congress or the several states pass laws to require the release of certain information such as summaries of tax returns to get on the presidential ballot, I\u2019m not sure we have much recourse other than to continue to demand it publicly, and act accordingly.",

Some mesmerizing characters which i am fond of are: 1.Mad men(Donald draper) It tells about how hard he is striving to have a perfect life, though he is a womanizer the loneliness inside him is perfectly displayed. 2.Breaking Bad(Walter white) One of the most loved character in television history, started as a cooker to help his family but later found out his love of life. 3.Boardwalk Empire(Enoch Thompson) Notorious bootlegger, his bad childhood days shaped him into different person 4.Dexter(Dexter Morgan) Dexter, who always find it difficult to get balance in life. This character is so special to me, i always put myself into his place(but not in the kill) 5.Sopranos(Tony) Mob Boss, who loves his family very much. 6.Six feet under(Nate Fisher) This character tells more about a bondings and expectations in a relationship. The above characters were touched to move on, when i finished watching those series. Who is the coolest TV series character? What TV show do you wish would come back? Can watching TV series be a hobby? I have seen Prison Break, Sherlock, Breaking Bad, Suits, Game of Thrones, Arrow and Flash. Which TV series should I start watching next? What TV show can you watch over and over and not get tired of it? True Detective:  I hate slow series but loved this one because of character details. The lead, Rustin Cohle (Matthew Mcconaughey) is described in great detail. Impeccable writing, brilliant direction and vivacious acting gave birth to this character. I almost binge watched the entire first season. The character is a chainsmoker and left so much impact on me that I bought an entire pack of cigarettes after watching first or second episode and finished it while watching the series. Forgot to mention, I don't smoke . I have been watching Sherlock lately and trust me, now my deduction skills have taken a uprise. So Sherlcok has this great deduection power. He can literally deduce your Dog\u2019s age by seeing what variety of Banana you are eating. Amazing, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m trying that too but I haven\u2019t been able to solve a case. But one thing that show has has helped me in, is that now I observe the things around more carefully. By the way, did you notice that double \u2018has\u2019 I put after show in the third line?  You might have seen it  But did you notice the extra \u2018e\u2019 in \u2018deduection\u2019 ? You see I am noticing things around me more carefully, Okay how many Buttons are there on the Sleeves of Sherlock\u2019s Suit in the picture above? I bet you didn\u2019t notice it unless you scrolled up to see the picture again. These things are happening to me where I am noticing everything around me. Bonus: Did you notice that I missed a \u2018o\u2019 in my \u2018Sherlcok\u2019 in the first line? Okay, you saw it, but can you tell me the colour of the tie Sherlock is wearing with the Suit in the picture above without scrolling ? [P.S: He isn\u2019t wearing any :)] Breaking Bad\u2014\u2014learned chemistry True Detective\u2014\u2014read more philosophy Yu-Gi_Oh\u2014\u2014\u2014learned to play with the cards Looney Tunes \u2014 adapted a care-free attitude I could go on! cheers!

        "a": "Bodhidarma was a Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th/6th century and is traditionally credited as the leading patriarch and transmitter of Zen (Chinese: Chan, Sanskrit: Dhyana) to China. He was the third son of a Tamil king of the Pallava Dynasty. According to Chinese legend, he also began the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolinquan. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th century qigong manual known as the Yijin Jing. Little contemporary biographical information on  Bodhidharma  is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend, but some accounts state that he was from a Brahman family in southern India and possibly of royal lineage.However Broughton (1999:2) notes that Bodhidharma's royal pedigree implies that he was of the Kshatriya warrior caste. Mahajan (1972:705\u2013707) argued that the Pallava dynasty was a Tamilian dynasty and Zvelebil (1987) proposed that Bodhidharma was born a prince of the Pallava dynasty in their capital of Kanchipuram[4] Scholars have concluded his place of birth to be Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, India. After becoming a Buddhist monk, Bodhidharma traveled to China. The accounts differ on the date of his arrival, with one early account claiming that he arrived during the Li\u00fa S\u00f2ng Dynasty (420\u2013479) and later accounts dating his arrival to the Li\u00e1ng Dynasty (502\u2013557). Bodhidharma was primarily active in the lands of the Northern W\u00e8i Dynasty (386\u2013534). Modern scholarship dates him to about the early 5th century. Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian. He is described as \"The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\" in Chinese texts. The Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall (952) identifies Bodhidharma as the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in an uninterrupted line that extends all the way back to the Buddha himself. D.T. Suzuki contends that Ch\u00e1n's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had \"no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism\" and that Ch\u00e1n historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.

If you're playing in live instruments, synthesizer or drums you want as low a latency as possible. Once you get to the mixing stage, you'll find certain plugins like limiters cause latency and if you're using a lot of plugins you might find yourself increasing the buffer size within your DAW which also increases latency. So try to compose and arrange first. Then you can mix, apply eq and compression etc and then lastly master your track by applying compression, limiting to the master buss. Can I create sound packs using default plugins on FL Studio? How do I master a song with clear and loud sound in FL Studio? What set up do I need to record vocals if I am using FL studio? I am using FL Studio. Should I use the primary sound card or ASIO driver while making music? How can I create the perfect piano sound in FL studio 12? I would say that you skip arranging if you have already mixed your track. Just master it. You can use  maximus  or  soundgoodizer.  However, I would not recommend soundgoodizer, as it can mess up your track badly. Once you have done that, render your track, sit back and relax. Hope this helps! I don\u2019t fully understand what you mean by mixing souds. mixing is something that should happen in between arranging in my opinion and also after the arranging. it should help you get the feel you want for your composition and shouldnt only occur after arranging. when you say mixing sounds do you mean maybe preparing a soundbank to use on a composition?",

The history of betting goes down to ancient times. It is commonly known that many Roman emperors enjoyed gambling and for many years it was only legal to place a bet in Rome at the circus or at the chariot races. Modern sports betting of course a bit differs from those times. It has strict rules and procedures. Nowadays we can make a sport bet without communicating with your bookmaker. You can do it very easily with the help of a special website or mobile app. Now comes the question \u2013 what is better: website or mobile app? I would choose mobile app. With the technological progress, sports apps and betting apps have evolved and now feature a rich collection of different functions, that can satisfy every customer. Now, there are many different betting apps for different platforms. In fact, betting from your smartphone has never been easier, it\u2019s literally just a few clicks. Here\u2019s a list of best betting apps. William Hill William hill betting app is on the top of iPhone rankings. It is visually pleasing, provides in-play markets, great odds rates. One of the most prominent features of William Hill app is that there are functions available only in the mobile version, like betting insurance. This motivates users to install it on their devices.

Convenient design allows users to navigate quickly through the categories and events. This makes this app perfect for people who like to bet at the last minute. Bovada Bovada (also known as Bodog) is one of the famous and oldest online sportsbooks that operate today. Important to mention, that this app is one the few that accept bets from the USA. Bovada covers all of the major US sports such as baseball, football, basketball, hockey and much more. Betfair This betting app lures customers with clean design style and easy to use menus. There are two apps available that carry the name Betfair. One is a classic sports book, that provides all kind of statistics, news, betting rates and other information. The second app is an exchange app, that allows you to place bets and receive prizes. We think that this division is not very convenient for the end user, but nevertheless, Betfair has its own fair share of customers. Paddy power Customer finds this betting app to be easy on the eyes. But we think that the majority of customers have stuck with this app because it combines a lot of features in one place. Customers can place bets, watch games, there is even a built in a casino. Also, it lures customer with special promotions that are offered periodically. Some say, that it is best all round iPhone app for betting. As any app, they all may have its pros and cons. Therefore, taking into account all of these, there may appear an idea of a good betting app that will include most requested features. But there\u2019s a question: how to make an app?

I have a brother who had depression and he may have killed himself if he hadn\u2019t gotten therapy. Fortunately he did get therapy and is feeling better about himself and his life. Also, just recently a horrible tragedy happened in my neighborhood: An 8th grader at the middle school I go to killed himself jumping off a water tower. I don\u2019t know all the details and I don\u2019t want to spread rumors but it was a shocking and horrible event and everyone cried and mourned his death. I didn\u2019t know the kid very well given I was a grade below him and he was a very popular person while I\u2019m a nerd, but I still cried because death affects and hurts everyone, not just the people closest to the person who died. just remember all isn\u2019t lost, people care about you and people can help you. but, if you want to kill yourself because you are terminally ill and in pain, be my guest. No one should have to suffer unnecessarily. The reason people are opposed to reason A is because they want to help you, while the reason people are opposed to reason B is because they are religious and believe that if you kill yourself, you will end up in hell.

You only have one chance at resurrection if you can beat God at a game of your choice. What game would you choose... I am getting the feeling that there is more to the situation then just choosing when to die.

        "a": "I don\u2019t think so. He is a narcissistic sociopath and mythomaniac. I know the symptoms very well. In his mind, he is the center of everything. No one else counts. He cannot help lying. He cannot understand why anything is not about him, or why people don\u2019t forget about his lies. People like Trump cannot change, which is why he is already in serious trouble, and his legislative agenda is on the ropes. Eventually, the looming catastrophe of the 2018 elections will force the Republicans\u2019 hands. He will either be impeached, or Mike Pence will gather enough cabinet votes to remove him. I knew this was going to happen. When you\u2019ve seen this sort of disease in one\u2019s own family, you recognize it before anyone else. Who is Donald Trump's base? Why is he popular? Why are people voting for him? Why do people like and support him? Is it feasible to build a wall between the US and Mexico as Donald Trump claims he would do? What is the possibility of Donald Trump being re-elected after this four years as President? I\u2019m upset that Trump won. What is the positive side that could help me get over it? What might happen now that President-elect Donald Trump has won the election? What will be the impact? Right now, prediction markets have it at a one third probability that Trump\u2019s presidency survives the year, let alone the whole 4-year term. So that puts an upper limit of 2/3 on the probability of him finishing his term. I would say this probability is somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2. Trump is going to have to revamp his entire modus operandi to stay in office. He is going to have to learn he cannot make spur of the moment decisions. Everything has to be vetted by people who know what they are doing. His instincts are not good. He was never a successful businessman. He was only a successful actor. It is not altogether different from what might happen if Martin Sheen or Keith Carradine found themselves in command of the actual Oval Office\u2014except they both have the humility to understand how unprepared they would be to take on the real presidency. Trump does not. His whole career he has skated the line between what is legal and illegal. He got away with it in business by having an army of lawyers who made it costly to punish him when he did something wrong. But now that he is President, the victims of his decisions have a bigger wallet than he has. Taxpayers foot the bill for suing him, not the people who directly oppose him. He might as well be picking fights with Warren Buffet whereas he is used to stiffing Joe the Plumber. I doubt it. I don\u2019t have any conclusive proof, I just doubt it. But then, after a while, I doubted he\u2019d become president, so I could be wrong. I can\u2019t claim I always doubted he\u2019d win, though. The moment I heard he threw his hat in the ring to run as president, I got a cold chill down my spine and thought, \u201coh dear God, he\u2019s going to be the next president.\u201d But afterwards I thought I was overreacting, and let it go. At this point, it\u2019s quite possible, even likely, he won\u2019t be impeached or in any other way (25th Amendment) forced to leave. I just don\u2019t see him wanting to be in there for 4 years. It\u2019s not an easy job, and it\u2019s often been described as a thankless one too. It\u2019s true he has many supporters, be he seems to have just as many detractors, and that\u2019s hard enough for someone with thick skin to criticism, something he just doesn\u2019t have. I also seriously doubt the health of someone his age, who is overweight, who mocks the idea of exercise, and who pretty regularly eats fast food. Add to that what might be the most stressful job on the planet, and it\u2019s a recipe for a massive heart attack. An even if he survived a heart attack, it might be difficult for him to resume his responsibilities. Even after the events of the past week (May 15 to 19 2017) it is more likely than not that President Trump will remain in office for at least four years of his first term. Impeachment and Senate conviction is incredibly hard, both legally and politically. As an example President Clinton obviously committed perjury and was impeached for it, but the Senate said \u2018so what and did not convict. President Johnson certainly fired his Secretary of War in contravention of law but the Senate did not convict. It would have to be a flagrant, serious and as obvious as Nixon\u2019s \u2018smoking gun tape\u2019 for Trump to resign as Nixon did. Or to have the House and Senate  as presently constituted  impeach and convict President Trump Congressional Elections 2018 With so much people making accusations without proper evidence, it's possible. There are people who will do anything to get what they want, even if it means making up some BS just to try and get him impeached.",

        "a": "As with any legal question \u2014 if you think your lawyer has lied to you and in doing so prejudiced the outcome of your case, you should  immediately   consult with another attorney in your jurisdiction familiar with ethical issues or contact your state licensing organization to obtain actionable advice on the matter. This is actually a very interesting question \u2014 I don\u2019t see anything in the Rules of Professional Conduct (Model or WA state) that  explicitly  say that a lawyer cannot lie to their client. So, an inconsequential lie (example: \u201cI read your email yesterday\u201d when it was read today without impact to the case) probably would not amount to the level of an ethical or malpractice issue. When it comes to a  material  lie that could affect the client\u2019s case, that gets into a nice little grey area. Again, I don\u2019t see any  explicit  statement that a lawyer can\u2019t lie, so we fall back on the two catch-all ethical duties: competence and diligence. WA RPC 1.1: A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. WA RPC 1.3: A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client. A strong case could be made that a lawyer who lies to a client about a  material  fact in their case, which if known might have affected the outcome, would be failing in both competence and diligence. This is, of course, assuming that the client can somehow prove both that (1) the lawyer actually knew about the fact, and (2) did not have an otherwise legitimate reason to deny or ignore such a fact. Comment 1 on WA RPC 1.3 provides some definite grey area here: \u2026A lawyer is not bound, however, to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client. For example, a lawyer may have authority to exercise professional discretion in determining the means by which a matter should be pursued\u2026 If the lawyer can come up with  any  strategic reason for their decision, they\u2019re likely to find an excuse under this rule comment, so long as they are able to demonstrate that they made that choice in compliance with the reasonable standards of the profession regarding such matters. TL;DR - Just because a lawyer lies to a client might not be sufficient for an ethical complaint, and it might not be sufficient for a malpractice claim on its own. The client would likely need to demonstrate actual prejudice to their matter for the ethical complaint to stand, and additionally that they would have prevailed had the lawyer not lied to them for a malpractice complaint to stand. This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.... How do lawyers handle lying clients? Do lawyers lie to their clients? Is a teacher allowed to lie? Can a client do the arguments in the court, with the help of his lawyer? Do lawyers ever betray their clients due to guilt? U.S. perspective Each state has its own laws and rules concerning attorneys\u2019 obligation to clients. In California, where I practice, the general  fiduciary obligation  of an attorney to use an appropriate level of skill, prudence and diligence in representing clients is established by case law. See, e.g.,  Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand . Lying to a client about a material matter would be a breach of that fiduciary obligation. Furthermore, California  Rule of Professional Conduct 3\u2013500  states: Rule 3-500 Communication A member shall keep a client reasonably informed about significant developments relating to the employment or representation, including promptly complying with reasonable requests for information and copies of significant documents when necessary to keep the client so informed. Lying to a client about a material matter would constitute a breach of this Rule. A breach of the fiduciary obligation and a Rule of Professional Conduct could result in  professional discipline by the State Bar . If the lie resulted in a financial loss to the client, it might also result in the attorney\u2019s civil liability to the client. However, I consider it unlikely that a prosecutor would bring a criminal action against the lawyer based on such facts. This is the type of matter that prosecutors typically consider to be handled adequately by civil action. This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.... Attorney regulations are governed by the state bar. Ill Rule of Prof. Conduct 8.4 prohibits a lawyer from engaging in misrepresentation or deception, presumably that includes lying to clients. A client may file a come point before the state bar if he believes that the lawyer has violated the rule. The client may also sue for breach of contract if the violation is material and client can show damages, or for malpractice if the client can show that the lie was a proximate cause of the clients losing the case. In practice, for most purposes, a complaint to the bar, can damage the lawyer but not benefit the client is the most likely available recourse. And of course, the client can fire the lawyer.",

        "a": "Should not there be something like a \"field\" that informs particles about what they are, how to interact, etc.? Indeed there should. And in fact, there  is . Quite a lot of fields, in fact. Furthermore, the fields are  more fundamental  than the particles. That is, particles themselves are merely excitations of (i.e., ripples in) their respective fields. Photons are ripples in the electromagnetic field, electrons and positrons are ripples in the electron field, and so forth. Where is the information about a particle\u2019s energy content stored? Is it stored in a field that surrounds that particle? What is likely to comprise a \"gravity wave\"? Is it related to the gauge bosom (elementary particles) and does it interact with the Higgs field... What do you know about the God particle? Do virtual particles and energy in vacuum really exist? How do we know if they exist if we can't observe them? Where are they? If a particle's spin is experimentally determined by observing their interactions with a magnetic field, how is the spin of a photon measured?... This is an intelligent question. In classical physics, equations of motions are obtained by minimising the Action, which I shall explain later. In quantum theory, all possible paths that can be taken are assigned a phase, so that summing over them causes cancellation of all the silly paths leaving a subset that looks like the classical result give or take Planck\u2019s Constant (for free particles). In physics, systems can be described using a Lagrangian, which is a function of \u201cposition\u201d and \u201cvelocity\u201d, except it does not have to be with respect to spatial coordinates, it can be with respect to coordinates in the configuration space of the system. For Newtonian particles, this Lagrangian is just (kinetic energy) - (potential energy). When you take a path through the configuration space and integrate the Lagrangian, you get an Action. In classical physics, finding the path that minimises the Action leads to equations of motions. Particles \u201cknow what to do\u201d as they inch along this \u201cminimum path\u201d, because finding the minimum overall is the same as finding the minimum \u201csegment\u201d they need to follow next. To us it looks like they are acting under local forces. In quantum theory, each path is given a phase (like a sine wave) that is proportional to the Action. When you add all the paths together you can get cancellation because of these phases. When you \u201cblock\u201d some of these paths (e.g. by introducing a double-slit experiment), the particle is unable to avail of all this cancellation and you get interference patterns. I should emphasise that the path integrals I have roughly described above were discovered by Dirac & Feynman and there are other mathematical techniques that do not require that we integrate over an infinite set of possible paths. Nevertheless, path integrals are the de facto standard for quantum field theory, so it is a good idea to understand what is meant by a Lagrangian, because the Standard Model, which describes three of the known forces, is expressed in terms of Lagrangians and path integrals. To answer your question about fields. Yes, particles do interact by coupling to fields, such as the photon field for EM. This results in virtual particles, such as photons, ferrying momentum between the interacting particles (please refer to Feynman Diagrams for a good picture of the mechanism). In quantum field theory, particles are treated as \u201cfree\u201d and having a very specific momentum, but change their momentum by exchanging gauge bosons, like the photon, which induces an interaction. However, we do not have a good formulation for how this works in the case of gravity. Gravitons are postulated as the \u201cforce mediator\u201d, but General Relativity and quantum field theory are not yet fully unified, although String Theorists will probably object to my saying this. There are forces existing everywhere in the Universe that cause all particles and all matter to react\u2026\u2026. and react only. There is no \u2018knowing\u2019 involved. In MC Physics terms, all matter is made up of quantized electrostatic charges, called mono-charges, that cause all forces (all electrostatic in nature) and all reaction are only between mono-charges.

Do not worry to much about this, as you will get the appropriate safety training for handling anything that could harm you. Does a chemistry major use more chemicals than a biochemistry major? Is biochemistry a branch in chemistry major or it's a major on its own? What is a chemistry major like at Hopkins? What is it like to major in chemical engineering? What are the scopes of studying biochemistry? While in school both majors take many of the same classes. Probably the most significant difference is that a chemistry major is going to take inorganic chemistry and analytical. Possibly more physical. Whereas the biochemistry major will take additional genetics and molecular biology. Both require a significant amount of laboratory classes and exposure to many different chemicals of varying levels of toxicity and reactivity. At a professional level, it depends upon the career. A bench biochemist will use more chemicals than a regulatory chemist, who mostly uses a pen. Otherwise, a bench chemist and a bench biochemist are just going to use different chemicals.

        "a": "Actually it is! Genetics is much more complicated that what the mom and dad look like. Each person carries an array of genes(dominant and recessive alleles), which combined with other genes at conception can result in a different looking child. The easy answer is: If any of the grandparents have brown eyes - it\u2019s very possible. Neither of my parents has green eyes. The have brown and brown-hazel eyes. But my grandfather had blueish-green eyes and I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have green eyes. I found an article online that sheds more light on the subject and goes into detail: Understanding Genetics Can two brown-eyed people have a blue-eyed child? Is it possible for a human to have two pupils in one eye? Will the progeny of a person with blue eyes and one with brown eyes always have brown eyes? Can two parents, one with blue eyes and one with brown eyes, produce a green eyes child? I have green eyes and both my parents have brown eyes. How is this possible? There are many genes coding for eye color and it is the final combination that results in the color. Here is a simple chart, the green variation is not included for simplicity: The high case letters means dominant genes and the lower case letters is recisive genes. The dominant genes give darker colors. As you can see many combinations gives blue eye, even if there is one dominant gene, but with two dominant genes the eyes becomes brown. Two blue eye parents with one dominant gene each, could give their child a combination of two dominant genes, one from each parent. And then the child would get brown eyes. It is possible, although uncommon, for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child. This is due to the mutation of the HERC2 gene, which is responsible for blue eyes, and its relationship to the melanin-producing gene OCA2. Both must be functioning for the production of pigment.The relationship between these genes allows someone to be a carrier of the brown-eyes trait without having brown eyes. So either one of the parent has a brown-eyes trait which becomes dominant in the baby, thus resulting in a brown eyed baby. Yes; This is because when two parents have two genes that could be passed on to their child. They can be carriers of the gene that'll give their child blue eyes. Even if blue eyes have not been very present in the family tree there is always a chance for that gene as long as it is there. If the parents are both homozygous for the allele for brown eyes then it's not possible. However if even one parent is heterozygous then it's a possible. It's all about percentages. For example: In a situation when two parents are heterozygous for brown eyes: Bb Bb x Bb Bb there possible children can consist of: Bb bb, BB bb, BB Bb, BBBB,  bb bb (< blue eyes) This varies if the parents are hereozygous or homozygous, but however to answer your question: yes it is totally possible.",

If you are lucky , you would get a minimum lot or more , if not lucky (people like you and me who didn\u2019t get allotment) you wouldn\u2019t get anything. Like this Article title perfectly sums it up: (Taken from  For HUDCO IPO allotment, it is all about your luck this afternoon as lottery will decide your fate ) But there are plenty of fish in the sea: Many new IPOs are coming out (Godrej Agrovet , CDSL , NSE , Cochin Shipyard, SIS , Prataap Snacks and many more) You can look at the cheap stocks in the secondary market.

Is it worth buying? After applying for an IPO, if shares are not allotted, will I get my money back? My experience has been that good customers who also take the new issue stinkers will get an allotment of the hot new issues. Overall, I think bllind passive investing in stocks is for chumps and suckers. One thing I did that worked however, was to always dump any hot new issue on the day of issue. I usually could get a premium price for it, or at least break even while the stinkers were supported by an underwriter\u2019s bid for a day or two. For a while, I made serious money, but when the bubble broker & there was less enthusiasm for hot new issues, my losses on the stinkers was greater than the gains on the goodies. Just applying thru a lot of slots (different accounts) won\u2019t get you the good ones. No, it is not true for retail investors it is purly luck.

So \u2026 more dangerous than the Nazi party of Hitler\u2019s Germany? The Politburo in Stalin\u2019s Russia? The  oprichnina  from Russia of Ivan the Terrible? The Khmer Rouge of Pol Pot? Or any of a host of other really really nasty groups? No. Of all the U.S. political parties, is one more racist? If so, is it the Republicans or the Democrats? Is the current American Republican Party the most dangerous organization in the world? If so, why; if not, why not? U.S. Political Parties: Should the United States be split into two countries, one for Democrats and one for Republicans? What are the most memorable one-liners in U.S. political history? What political party do I most align with? Absolutely, positively not . It's not even the most dangerous political organization  currently. There are certain things about the Republican Party I vehemently disagree with, but it's still the fringe elements that are legitimately dangerous. Similar to the fringe elements here, there is a particular political party that is not only just as ideologically dangerous, they are in unilateral power in their country, and at continuous war to keep said power: the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. When they were called the Taliban, we (US) went to war against them for harboring Al Qaeda. That would be another political organization more dangerous than the Republican Party. Also, ISIS and several other organizations in the Middle East alone. There is also the North Korean government, which is supreme within their sphere, despite not being nuclear capable. That's to mention nothing of the Mongols, Imperialists, Inquisitors, Crusaders, Ancient Rome, the Third Reich, the Soviet Union, or the Italian Fascists. There are others, too, but a list of political organizations more dangerous than the generic (brand-name?) American right-wing party would be exhaustive and no one would read it. Not in \u201chistory\u201d in total. But it is an outlier in not only the contemporary West, but in particular ways in the wider scope of Western history. I genuinely do not think the average contemporary Republican understands that. The US\u2019 so-called Grand Old Party is not at all a run of the mill right of center party in a broader comparative context. The specific combination of beliefs, the quasi-authoritarian (yes) views about crime and punishment, and the evangelical Protestant-derived social policy, and the economic corporatism, and the foreign policy views that range from messianic neo-imperialism to impulsive, reactant isolationism without a credible rationale, does verge on the threatening. Threatening domestically and internationally. Disclaimer : This answer may be a highly controversial and biased but in this day and age, what isn't? * Shrug * I believe Noam Chomsky said this and more often than not, I tend to agree with him but in this case the statement should be taken with a pinch of salt. Noam Chomsky: Republican Party the most dangerous organization \u2018in human history\u2019 What does it mean to say not only are we not doing anything about climate change, but we\u2019re trying to accelerate the race to the precipice?\u201d  Mr. Chomsky  said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether they genuinely believe it or not if the consequence of that is, \u2018let\u2019s use more fossil fuels, let\u2019s refuse to subsidize developing countries, let\u2019s eliminate regulations that reduce greenhouse gases.\u2019 If that\u2019s the consequence, that\u2019s extremely dangerous.\u201d I know the GOP doesn't commit indiscriminate murder like Daesh or have gas chambers like the Nazis but hear me out here. Not many people realise the extent to which climate change can potentially destroy the planet. If you'd taken some time to watch the buttload of documentaries released by Al Gore, Di Caprio and others, you might have some idea but no worries. To put it in perspective, US is the only developed nation to not officially believe in the science of climate change. But don't get ahead of yourselves. In India, where I was brought up, a country still believed to be backward and \u201cdeveloping\u201d, I learnt about the theory of evolution and climate change way back in middle school. What does that tell you about GOP politicians who rewrite scientific facts and stick to the past? Note: If it is not clear I am not defending any of the tryannical political regimes of the past or just bashing on the GOP for no good reason. I am just trying to make sense of a statement confidently said by one of the greatest living political thinkers. It is because it denies the existences of the greatest existential threat to humanity ever: climate change, while also increasing the likelihood of nuclear catastrophe (see the Doomsday clock:  Timeline  ), which could cause nuclear winter and massive global species extinction.",

        "a": "It may sound like sacrilege to some, but I haven\u2019t read all of Buffet\u2019s letters to shareholders. And I definitely don\u2019t know it all. What year is that Buffet letter? I\u2019d like to read that in context. Where I come from, a \u201cworkout\u201d is not a security, and there is no public market. The market is private. For me, a Workout is a loan gone bad, and the lender is trying to \u201cwork with\u201d the borrower to come up with a payment plan or other resolution. Hence the name \u201cwork out\u201d, or seeking a route to get the borrower out of a defaulted condition on the loan and performing again. Some banks do sell sell workout status loans. Not all the time, however. Banks take great pride in being able to work out their problem loans, and have well-trained staff that specialize in workout. When a sale is done, the assets - which may be called workouts (\u201cWOs\u201d) / non-performing assets (\u201cNPA\u201d) / charge-offs (\u201cCOs\u201d) - typically are sold to private investors - usually debt collectors - who have sufficient capital and resources to buy them and complete the workouts. Sometimes such sales do happen through a loan sale advisor. A loan sale advisor is a type of broker because they typically do not put up capital. So in the upside down world of finance, their names are often in the form \u201cxxxx Capital Corp\u201d. You can easily find the leading ones on the internet. When such a sale of NPA does occur through an advsior , the bidders are well vetted for their ability to close on a purchase. The advisor will tell the seller: \u201cYes, so-and-so\u2019s bid is higher, but we have doubts that they can close. We suggest . . . \u201c So we come to the \u201chedge\u201d part. Good collectors have what are called \u201cliq\u201d or \u201cLiquidation\u201d curves that summarize their past experience at resolving or liquidating past pools of defaulted loans of various types that they have bought and worked. Collectors will tell you that results vary greatly even when pools appear similar, This is a high risk endeavor. Therefore I would imagine that only very low cost pools of workouts could predictably offset lost earnings in \u201cbad years\u201d and thereby act as an earnings hedge. Buffet and his many enterprises may very well include such businesses and the requisite sophistication, and the workouts could very well act as an offset or hedge. But I\u2019d like to read the specific letter.",

Okay, maybe a bit more than that, but it\u2019s important to understand that the attraction that comes with the Conservative party actually has a lot to do with their name. Conservative: i.e. to conserve the status quo. The country is filled with many, many issues right now and currently at the risk of going off a cliff. The reason why the Conservative party are doing so well is for many reasons: They project themselves as strong, and stable. Their strong and stable appearance has worked well because the far-right media has done well to work for their political buddies who are currently in power; by keeping out any competition. There is a clear disparity between the younger audience and the older; in the way that they consume the news. Hence why older people tend to be a lot more conservative; they watch a lot more mainstream media. This, combined with younger voters being apathetic is why the conservatives have such a strong lead. The conservative values are not what a lot of the people of the UK tend to share; but rather that the opposition is that heavily outgunned politically that they often get no coverage what so ever. Labour wants to get rid of university tuition fees; the Conservatives wish to bring back fox hunting and end school meals for poor kids. In the U.K., do they register for a party to vote? Is the American Republican Party more or less conservative than the UK Conservative Party? In the UK election, why didn't the Conservative party promise to stay in the EU? They could easily win and it would probably be better for Bri... What is a conservative party in India? Are UK ambassadors members of conservative party? The Conservatives appeal on several levels. I would say that they have a work ethic and libertarian streak that many citizens approve of. The Party itself has always been more fragmented than, say, Labour. Labour has always had a strong central core, believing in central, top-down government. Control has, after all, been the guiding principle of Socialist governments, whether it is control of energy, production, food supply or any other issue. The Conservatives always used to have utterly independent local parties that were loosely bound to a central office, but that central office could not impose, say, candidates for the constituencies without the agreement of the local members. That meant that when a Conservative MP was elected, he or she would be more likely to listen to the voices of local members and constituents. However, the appeal right now is much more due to the position of the nation with the EU. Since Brexit will entail a lot of hard bargaining, the nation needs a strong leader. It is clear from polling results that the majority of the nation believes that Mrs May has a better chance of negotiating than the leaders of any of the other parties. Not much, rich definitely get richer and pay less, poor get poorer and pay more, everything gets privatised and working class items get taxed more and more every year. They are warsome, power hungry classists that rely on taxong the little man to pay for the big, hence the name! They keep the legalised extortion of higher rate taxation to a minimum whilst still running a reasonably ethical society. They\u2019re centrist. And that\u2019s what we Brits like. It\u2019s how Blair got the Labour Party into power for a while - going centrist. When the Tories head to the right they get voted out. When Labour lurch to the left they get voted out. Balance things and that\u2019s what Brits will go for every time.",

With front-end work, you have an arbitrary number of systems, all with different hardware and browsers. That is one of the reasons why frameworks, and rigidly staying within the bounds of those frameworks, can aid in rapid front-end development. Basically, you hand off concerns about cross-browser and cross-system problems to the developers of the framework. That said, to say that it is  harder  is incorrect. On the client, you have only one system to worry about vis-a-vis performance: the client. On the server, you have to worry about the performance of an arbitrary number of clients connecting all at once. That is terror-inducing. They are different. In Node, all you have to worry about is how to access and transport data as quickly as possible. On the client, you have to worry about how that data is being presented, but don\u2019t really have to worry too much about moving it around on the client. Both can be hard.

        "a": "Normally when you pause the download it will continue where you left it last time, so i\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happened there. Since you mentioned that you have a friend who plays Dota 2 then you better get it from him without downloading it you have two ways to do that: First method  : i have tried it with my friend in L4D2, your friend should go to Steam games directory \u201cchange x with your local drive\u201d X:\\Program Files (x86)\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\\n then he transfers Dota 2 folder to a flash drive and give it to you, now what you have to do is pause downlaoding Dota 2 , close steam, go to the same directory that i mentioned above and move the folder there, if it asks you to replace choose yes for all, when the transfer is complete, open steam and launch and resume the download you have to wait for few minutes so that it recognizes that it has all the files and there you are you have the full game, it may needs to run updates from time to time but that\u2019s has to do with new patches not the base game. Second method  : which is much easier to do, you friend should backup dota 2 by going to: the top left of steam >> Backup and restore games >> backup recently installed games>> choose Dota2, the directory of the backup and the split size(DVD will do fine) when the process of the backup done your friend will give you the backup then all what you have to do is going to the top left of steam >> Backup and restore games >> restore a previous backup>> choose the backup folder and let it install. Is there a way to know how many downloads a game had on Steam? Why does my steam download get stuck at 100%? How do Steam's game download files work? How do you make Steam download faster? My game download on Steam stopped. I haven't paused it. By the way, I use a Mac. What do I do? This is due to the Steam Download packing from the developers themselves. This is because when game files are downloaded, they not just downloaded in one huge file, it is a sequence of multiple files that all extract to make the final game data. The reason why this happened, is because the pack file you were on started at 443.3 MBs of data, and when you ended the download and started again, it started to redownload from the start. Usually this does not happen as developers will try their hardest to use as many pack files as possible (so people cannot pirate the game), but for Dota 2, a game that is free and is available around the world and is relatively small. It is not necessary to create so many packs. Yes you can get a copy of dota 2 from your friend. Since Dota 2 is a f2p(Feee 2 Play) game, you can use this method. Step 1:  Ask your friend to create a backup of Dota 2 from game properties. Step 2:  Transfer it into your PC and click restore game from steam options. Step 3:  Download a tiny update. Step4: Play!! NOTE:  You can restore a backup game only if its a F2P game or you purchased it. As for your main question, it seems ita a bug which results when you have paused the download and coincidentally the developers have released an update. Hence, your download resets.The same happened with me when I was downloading Team Fortress 2. Thank you. Have fun! It could be due to weak connections. Normaly if you a poor Internet connection, it seems that the download is running smoothly actually hasn't. It just a illusion even the download it complete it restart from debut. I know What you are doing and you know what Same thing happened to me a week ago. I m also Downloading dota 2 with my jio sim(and i know You are too) And with daily struggle I have completed till now, I had downloaded half of it. You had your Downloading reset to 400mb but mine got to straight 100 mn after downloading 2 gbs of data\\U0001f613\\U0001f613. This Isn't the answer you wanted but reading your situation (which is coincidently accurately Same to mine) i just wanna Share my experience also. Also Happy there are people out there with the same struggle!\u2026.",

        "a": "Having worked in the consulting business as well as Data Science, here\u2019s my $0.02. Management consulting is a very wide field. A good area to explore in this field is analytics consulting, i.e. job roles that focus on using data science to solve business problems. While almost every consulting project requires the analysis of data to solve the problem, analytics consulting is much more focused. The main advantage of working in this space is that you have the opportunity to be exposed to problems in a wide variety of industries/verticals. This is extremely helpful in understanding the vast applications of data science. Moreover, working in consulting helps you build some very important skills such as understanding the problem from the client\u2019s perspective, and presenting analyses to clients in an easy-to-understand manner. One of the most important skills a Data Scientist needs is the ability to explain their analyses to non-technical people. When you\u2019re dealing with clients, in the majority of cases you\u2019re not dealing with people that are interested in understanding the nitty-gritties of the algorithms you\u2019ve used, or why Random Forests are better models etc. They\u2019re interested in understanding how you can solve the problem and how useful your solution will be to their business. This forces you to think from a completely different perspective, unlike a traditional data scientist. A complex ensemble model with a high accuracy might be a very good model to use on the data you have, but it might not make any sense from the business perspective. This is important to understand when presenting solutions to end users. Working as a consultant for a few years will help you build this skill set that will prove to be very useful as you progress in your career. After working in analytics consulting for a while, if you\u2019re truly interested in the technical aspects of data science such as building better algorithms, then you can switch roles. At that point of time, you will understand how analytics can be applied to various business problems, and can choose what industry or vertical you want to focus on. In my current role, the main focus is on designing better methodologies/algorithms, research on various models and how current processes can be improved using better models, etc. While client needs are still a priority, that doesn\u2019t necessarily define the way things work. A traditional Data Scientist has more freedom to explore out of the box solutions that might not be used in a consulting environment. On a completely different perspective, one of the biggest challenges of the consulting industry is the travel requirement. For many people, consulting doesn\u2019t hold the same charm as they progress in their lives because of this demanding requirement. Traveling to the client\u2019s site from Monday-Thursday every week for a few months is not very exciting when you have a family or responsibilities at home. However, for someone fresh out of grad school, these restrictions might not necessarily apply. This is when you\u2019re truly starting your career, and being in consulting will give you a chance to explore various options. These experiences mould you as a person, and can be truly rewarding down the line. Obviously not everyone is interested in such a lifestyle, but if this is something you feel you will be comfortable with, then definitely consider it as a serious option. As a data scientist, how can I pivot my career to management consulting (MBB in particular)? Why are there so many fake data scientists and machine learning engineers? Do I need to take the IIT or JEE to become a data scientist? I am working as a data scientist. Is data science and consulting relevant? How should I go about changing my profession from being a manager to data scientist? Did you enjoy your CS studies? Do you actually like working on technical stuff? In that case, data scientist would be a good choice of career. Do you prefer working with people? In that case, management consulting would be a good choice of career. There are a lot of variables to consider, and without knowing your goals, it is hard to make a good recommendation. However, I personally would recommend data science career path. But I'm biased and this could be bad advice. I have never had the title \"Data Scientist\", but through my career I have been a Business Analyst, Sr Analyst, Quant, Statistician, Manager of Price Optimization, and now Manager of Market Analysis. But, at the time, there really wasn't a career path for Data Scientists so I sort of stumbled my own way to where I am. But, you could say that I've taken the career analyst/manager track over the consulting track. I also have never worked as a Management Consultant. But, through my career I have worked with, traveled with, and hung-out with many of them. And the one thing that I can say is: I am glad I'm not a management consultant. But it all depends on your goals. A good management consultant makes a lot of money, especially right out of school. Probably way more than you could make as an entry-level data scientists. And it is a good way to get a lot of experience fast. Experience that you probably would never get as a career data scientist, unless you are a consulting data scientist (which could very well be an option). I emphasize \"good\" here, a bad consultant is quickly out of a job. But, management consultants totally quality of life is rough. They normally travel 3-4 weeks per month. Often have long-term assignments far away from home. Work 80 hour weeks, under high pressure and tight deadlines. And, in the end, except for a few, get very little recognition. If you like hotels and don't have attachments, like family or pets or a house or friends you like to see more than once a month, it can be a good career. But burnout is common. On the other hand, I'm a company man and my day goes something like. I get up in my own bed at 7am and get a shower and grab some clothes from the laundry (not a suitcase). Spend some time watching the news with my wife. Feed my dogs. Make a cup of coffee and drive 10 minutes to work. Chat with co-workers (that I've known for year, because I haven't hopped from job to job) for a bit, boot up my laptop maybe grab another coffee. Spend some time reading a few comics like dilbert and maybe check my quora feed (maybe answer a question, like today). Then I start working on whichever project I left un-finished yesterday at 5pm when I left the office. I maybe have a few meetings or phone calls with consultants where I tell them what to do, or that they missed something in their analysis. Maybe not, maybe it\u2019s a quiet day. I go out to lunch with friends or run home on lunch. Maybe in the afternoon there is a fire drill, and something needs answered right away. Usually something comes up. At about 5pm, I go home. I mow my grass or something, walk my dogs, maybe go out, volunteer and /or relax. Some could call it boring. But, my career gives me time to find fulfillment outside of my work. My quality of life is very high and pleasant. I may not make as much money, but I'm comfortable. I've come to realize that I am glad I took the career path and not the consulting path. I've seen many people do a dual path that seems to work well. Start as a management consultant while you are young and have the energy (and maybe fewer attachments). Do that for about 5 years and then move into a career analyst/data scientist track. There are some notable advantages here. First, you make a lot of connections to help you on the way, and you can shop for the type of company for which you want to work. Second, you get a big leg up when you start at a company if you have worked with them in the past. Third, some big management consulting firms have an unwritten policy of trying to place their consultants with the companies they work for. I've seen BCG do this several times. They run a project, and then the project lead joins the company as a manager (or higher) to \"continue the work\". Then, new projects tend to go back to BCG. It's a valuable cycle for both BCG and the project lead. I'm not sure if any of that is an answer, because it ultimately is up to you and your goals and individual situation. It probably wouldn't hurt to pursue multiple options as you apply for positions since there is a lot a variability in what each company can offer. A good consulting firm can be a lot lower stress than a bad company. So, good luck. It's an exciting time and it's easy to get caught up in the stress of starting your career. But enjoy it. Make lots of friends, hang out, and don't take work too seriously.",

        "a": "I\u2019ll echo, that depends entirely on what you choose to work with, how you specialize, etc. I also think it is irrelevant to talk about \u2018more\u2019 chemicals (even though I guess you are not solely referring to the mass). I won\u2019t go into technicalities about everything, also water, being a chemical, because I guess that\u2019s not what you mean. But it is relevant to know if you are interested in potentially harmful (to humans) chemicals, or if you are more interested in the actual bulk of packages coming from chemical suppliers, or something else entirely. I am in a lab where we work closely with chemists, and we even had some chemistry BSc\u2019s come do MSc and PhD in our lab (I\u2019m a biochemist/molecular neurobiologist). And the general joke is that in a chemistry lab, you use gloves and lab coat to protect yourself from hazardous chemicals, where in a biology lab, you use the same to protect you cell cultures from you. That said, we often work with chemicals that are specifically toxic to living things, because that is needed when working with living things. Where you could have a chemistry lab working entirely on e.g. producing steviol glucosides, where none of the end products would be toxic in small amounts (though some of the reagents would probably still be). Or (as was also noted in another answer), some chemists, like the group I am currently publishing a paper with, are computational chemists. Their lab is an office with a computer. And you can also do  in silico  work with biochem, e.g. many of the systems biology fields have plenty of people who do their work purely on a computer, as do bioinformatics researchers. Give a little bit more info on what exactly you are interested in (any specific types of chemicals, etc.), and I could perhaps be slightly more specific, though it would still depend. Is biochemistry a branch in chemistry major or it's a major on its own? Does chemistry major use chemicals more than a biochemistry major? Is biochemistry an easier major than mechanical engineering? Why should I major in Chemistry? What jobs can I get with that major? What is it like to major in chemical engineering? Entirely depends what you do. If you\u2019re a computational chemist my money\u2019s on the biochemist using more in the lab.",

        "a": "According to one study, yes, the center of what used to be the Roman Province of Dacia does: Although it might just be celtic DNA or even latinized german DNA (The study however strongly suggests that it\u2019s not, since we see no such DNA in the surrounding areas, despite a far greater deal of celts/germans having settled there, as opposed to central Transylvania, especially in what is today\u2019s Hungary). Another study disagrees, saying we see more latin genetic heritage in Albania and Greece (although it more likely comes from medieval-Renaissance italians rather than ancient latins) and showing a celto-germanic latin-like DNA migratory path into Romania (which wouldn\u2019t be mutually exclusive with the existence of some ancient latin DNA there): Yet another study disagrees when it comes to Albania and Greece and reveals a celto-germanic migratory extension of latin-like DNA rather than a roman pathway (although the two aspects are not mutually exclusive) as well. A while ago I read that there are a lot of tombstones of romans from Italy in today\u2019s Romania and that most of them came from the South where you see more of J2 instead of R1B-S28 (also referred as U152). And considering the extension of J2 mimics the borders of the late roman empire perfectly (even with concessions in areas of strong germanic migration) it\u2019s very likely the case many colonists were rather J2 latins. A more on point study (which looked closely at romanians) would strongly point to a \u2018\u2019 partial yes\u2019\u2019 to your answer:  DNA of the majority ethnic group in Romania and Moldova  in the sense that they are likely somewhat roman but together with the local greeks and bulgarians. Although some might argue it\u2019s just because that\u2019s a stratum (j2 and e1b) we see in all south europeans. \"Our genetic study was focused on old human populations from the Bronze and Iron Ages from Romania [...] Concerning the genetic relationships at mitochondrial level, old human populations from Romania have shown closer genetic relationship to Turks of Thracian origin, while  modern Romanians were closer to modern Bulgarian, Italian, Greek and Spanish populations .\" \"A striking feature of the samples used for this study is how well the geographic origin of the samples appears to correlate with the genetic origin, so that separating the samples by country of origin or on the basis of genetic measures gives similar results. The only major deviation from this pattern is with the Romanian samples that appear to be closer to the Spanish samples (further 'west') than their geographic position would indicate. This could be because of the historical close ties between Romania and Italy, but further studies would be required to confirm this.\" In conclusion, I find it very likely that romanians do have some actual, ancient latin genetic heritage (at a level higher than surrounding countries), depending greatly on what area we\u2019re talking about. If we\u2019re talking about S Transylvania, then I wouldn\u2019t be surprised for it to be in the 15%+ level, if we\u2019re talking about N Moldova, I doubt it surpasses 5%. It\u2019s very hard to know tho, because it\u2019s nearly impossible to say weather than 5\u201310% r1b-s28 comes from a latin, a celt or a german, weather than 5\u201315% J2 comes from a latin, an anatolian, an iberian, an armenian, a balkan native or what, just as it\u2019s very hard to say how much of the smaller % (such as i2a or g2a, etc) might come from Italy.",

        "a": "Dear OP, Congratulations! If you\u2019ve scored this with no formal entrance coaching or training, it\u2019s quite a good score. However, if you\u2019re mulling over \u2018drop year\u2019 because you\u2019ve scored 90 this year hoping you\u2019d be able to improve drastically should you be given coaching, then I\u2019d have to narrate my story and the story of at least hundreds of aspirants. I do not intend to deter you, but merely want you to make an informed choice knowing the possible pitfalls and benefits of a \u2018drop year\u2019. Back in 2016, I had given CLAT without any preparation. In fact, I didn\u2019t even want to write the exam. That day, I spent most of my early morning in a pub. If it hadn\u2019t been for a fellow friend who persuaded me to write the exam, I wouldn\u2019t have written it at all. But, then I wrote. When the results came, I did okay - not too good, but not too bad either. As it happened, I figured in the allotment list as well. This is where I got cocky. Thinking if I could do this much without preparation at all, I wondered quite haughtily how well I could do should I go for coaching like everyone else. Without thinking twice, I took the plunge and dropped a year for CLAT. Until a few days back, it\u2019s pure agony. You could prepare, but you\u2019ll have a challenging time seeing your friends in college. You\u2019ll be faced with immense self doubt, and bouts of all kinds of mood. Loneliness and humiliation might also become a norm in all kinds of social gathering. Should you come from a successful family, you\u2019d have really hard time for a year. At the end of all these, one might think success is at least a bit guaranteed. I can assure you, there\u2019s no such thing. I could only score 8 marks more than what I did back in 2016. A fellow friend whom I met during the plunge did terribly as well. He, who scored around 145, was left with a paltry 114 this year. I\u2019ve seen the same fate visiting all my fellow classmates who took the plunge \u2014 only one managed to even breach 120 level. I do have to warn you that \u2018drop years\u2019 are not always successful. Some are, I do admit. However, this is more of an exception than generality. You could all the papers that have come so far and still do poorly. You could be pretty brilliant and still score low marks. There\u2019s no guarantee, and I emphasize it. If you think you can pull through an year, I do wish the best for you. Whatever you choose, may you be successful in that. Is it better to take VIT or drop a year? I got 97.75 in CLAT 2016. Can I get any NLU with this score or should I take a drop? How many years is CLAT LLM? Is HNLU worth it or should I take a drop and give CLAT again next year? Should I take a drop for CLAT? I pretty much determined to give my best effort for 1 year. If yes, how should I tell this to my father? This classic 2 x 2 decision grid helps making a decision. As you can see, taking a drop has the best and the worst possible outcomes. On the other hand, not taking a drop gives you less risky outcomes at a cost. So, ultimately, it depends on you. If you have a high level of risk appetite, taking a drop would make sense. If you are not much of a risk taker but can afford the cost associated with minimising the risk, not taking a drop would be the best course of action. Hi!! YES!! WHY NOT? I dropped a year and now I\u2019m confident of making it to top 5. Don\u2019t lose hopes and faith so easily just because you face 1 failure. If you are really sure of putting in enough hard work, then sure you can!! Else, if there is too much of \u201cparental/ society pressure\u201d of you, join wherever you can get now and try next year :) Good Luck!! May the force be with you!!",

Groceries, toiletries, socks, underwear are all things that will find people with a variety of economic levels buying similar things and in the same stores at times in the US. There are some discount stores like TJ Maxx and Marshalls in one area where I shop that have hourly wage clerks shopping next to professional women who earn six figures and wives of professional athletes who have even larger household annual incomes of eight figures. It isn't cheaply made in a sweatshop Walmart clothes, but it isn't custom made-to-measure clothing either. You may remember that Michelle Obama bought some clothing and accessories for her girls and herself from J. Crew for President Obama\u2019s first inauguration. Those were mass produced, ready-to-wear items at reasonable prices that most middle class families could probably afford for a special occasion or \u201cSunday best\u201d outfit. They had plenty of money in the bank from book sales as well as from both adults having been successful professionals, but they still shopped at Target, J. Crew and other stores commonly patronized by average American shoppers (although online because of kimits on their movements). Outlets where bridge lines from designer brands are less expensive and patronized by middle class and upper middle class people in the US are pretty common. I don't know how often the top one percent visit the outlet mall, but some self-made people like Tyra Banks have stated that they still like to bargain shop. Are the truly high income people shopping  regularly  at dollar stores or the cheapest stores? Probably not. There are issues of quality for some brands carried there and where such stores are located as well. I think some people enjoy the thrill of the \u201chunt\u201d for a bargain whether it be for clothes or household items. What makes it a bargain will change with one's finances and standards. At a certain income level, shopping at lower end retailers or discount stores is not going to happen much or at all due to other factors outweighing the perceived benefit in the prices. My  time  is my most valuable commodity now, so it makes more sense for me to pay more for home delivery or to do grocery curbside pick up than to waste time in any store to save a few dollars. I can fill an online shopping list during \u201cfound\u201d minutes here or there while on hold with a phone call or while waiting for a computer program to load, etc. It is worth more to me to have the hour saved from not being in a discount store with insufficient staff than to save even $30 off a basket of groceries at this point in my life. To people with far more money than me, I would guess the value of their time is even more pronounced. Where do stores like TJ Maxx and JC Penney's buy their clothes from? How much does it cost just to supply one of their stores with clothes? In Lucknow, from where should I buy clothes at cheap prices? Which are best brands for men from Myntra to buy clothes? Can you buy brand name clothing and get it cheaper from China? Why don't some people save money to spend on travel by buying cheap clothing? Zara and H&M are relatively low-priced fast fashion and fashionistas as well as people who do buy luxe clothing also shop there.",

        "a": "Montaigne\u2019s book is one of the most wonderful in existence, and can change your life, but as a starting place in  philosophy,  it might give you the wrong idea. I might suggest you start with one of the early Platonic dialogues:  Euthyphro, Apology, Meno,  or  Phaedo.  This will give you some idea of how philosophy began, what kind of discourse it deals in, and what purposes it was initially envisaged to serve. If you like these, read the  Republic  and others. It has been said that all philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato. This is an exaggeration, but not a wild one. Plato and his student Aristotle form the foundation of philosophical discourse in the West. From there, you can strike out in many directions. You might also want to read a book on the history of philosophy. Avoid Bertrand Russell\u2019s, which was a potboiler and does serious injustice to some important thinkers, particularly Hegel and Nietzsche. Avoid, too, Will Durant. Anyone who thinks Voltaire may have been the greatest philosopher ever to live should clearly have stuck to writing popular histories. Try, instead, something like Anthony Kenny\u2019s  A New History of Western Philosophy \u2014  readable, clear, written by a master, and more balanced than Russell\u2019s often-cheeky, always-tendentious account. Amazon.com: A New History of Western Philosophy (9780199656493): Anthony Kenny: Books But by all means,  do  read Montaigne. He is wonderful, and his  Essais  a book to live with, reread, and savor. Seventeen! So young. I wish you many happy hours in the study of this great discipline. The humanities are quite out of fashion now, and perhaps in irremediable eclipse, but they continue to reward those who come to them seeking illumination \u2014 not with the meaning of life, perhaps, but certainly with some enlarged sense of what life is, and what sort of creatures we are. Best wishes. How do I get started with philosophy? Which books are the best to begin with? I've not read a book since high school. I want to start. Where do I begin? I want to start reading on philosophy, be it any kind. Where should I start? I want to start reading a good finance book. Which book should I start with? (non-fiction) Which is a good book to start with if I want to take up reading? Montaigne\u2019s  Essays  may not be the best place to begin reading philosophy, but it\u2019s a marvelous book generally. It\u2019s lively, funny, and as Montaigne himself says, it is an honest book, in that it presents an honest picture of its author. You can dip into it a bit at a time if you like, or binge read the whole thing. It\u2019s one of my two most frequent recommendations for high school and college students who want to read something from the canon\u2014the other is Herodotus\u2019s  Histories\u2014 both chosen for the same reason: that they have a lot of good bits in them. They are rich with humanity and with imagery, as Shakespeare\u2019s plays are. If you read philosophy for its original purpose, thinking about how to live well, then it is a very good place to start. See the books referred to in  Andrew Weill's answer to Why is philosophy so painful to read?  and other answers to that question. In my opinion, one of the most difficult parts of learning philosophy is setting aside one\u2019s presuppositions, so one may try to understand someone else\u2019s world-view. Part of that requires a lot of background in many areas of culture, including math, the sciences, history, the arts, etc. It also requires learning to critically and dispassionately assess a philosophical position. Second, a student of philosophy, at no matter what level of learning, must appreciate that some positions taken by some philosophers often seem to be loony. Instead of judging a philosopher on first reading, try to understand exactly what he or she is trying to assert. This often takes a lot of effort, including setting aside your own presuppositions and ideas. Keep in mind that philosophical terminology often don\u2019t coincide with common usage. So, a good dictionary of philosophical terms would be a wise investment. I have always found Parmenides, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, are the sources and quite intellectually nourishing, but philosophy has evolved a lot in the 2,300+ years since they lived and has developed very technical terms. I don\u2019t know if there is any good way to start learning philosophy, especially as an autodidact. I suggest that whatever approach you use, do not limit yourself to only a few sources. Keep a few good general histories of philosophy nearby and consult them often. If you can afford it, I encourage purchasing Copleston\u2019s History of Philosophy. I also recommend that you find web pages and websites dedicated to philosophy that are written and edited by reputable philosophers. Many university philosophy departments have good resources available for free. Two cautions: (1) A professional philosopher\u2019s use the word \u201cphilosophy\u201d is not nearly identical with the way it is commonly used. (2) Stay away from pseudo-philosophies until you are prepared to appraise them, critically and knowledgeably. I would initially stick with philosophers whose works have stood the test of time. Finally, I encourage you to study informal logic before you embark on a serious study of philosophy. I also recommend reading a few good books about the history of ideas, as an adjunct to your study of philosophy. I applaud your interest in philosophy. You are embarking on what can be among the most stimulating and interesting of intellectual endeavors, but keep in mind that you might have to go into intellectually unexpected places. Keep at it, learning is a lifetime activity.",

        "a": "Are we talking pharmaceutical, legal diazepam injection or crushed up tablets from the corner drug pusher? Pharmaceutical Diazepam injection can cause phlebitis, irritation of a vein, if injected into a vein, presumably it could do this in an artery, too. The concern would be whether it could cause constriction downstream from the injection site in an artery, interfering with the blood flow. If this lasts long enough there could be tissue death downstream. If this is crushed up street diazepam from a tablet it will result in small particles in the injection. This will almost certainly obstruct some small arteries downstream and may cause tissue death. It can also cause infection in the arteries or other tissues (skin, bone, muscle) downstream. On the street the administration of drugs into blood vessels, veins or arteries, is often worse than the drug itself, leading to embolization of vessels, infections in heart, lung, blood vessels, bone, brain - anywhere in the body - as well as Hepatitis B and C and HIV injection. it is a bad idea. Why the veins appear blue although the blood they carry is red? How would I know if I had something injected into an artery? At what point does an artery become a vein? Why does blood spurt out of a cut artery but not a cut vein? What would happen if I injected a shot of vodka into my veins? If it is injected in vein, you gonna sleep deeply.

It is a supernatural means that Dracula utilizes to disguise himself and get into places or do things that would not permit a human form otherwise. Dracula is unlike any other vampires in that he sold his soul to the devil to become the worlds  first  vampire. He is also a wizard of sorts and can manipulate black magic. That makes him a wholly supernatural being that no longer holds a physical form - and that means he is more of a  phantom  than a vampire that still lives inside of a human body. If he appears in any solid tangible observable form it is because he personally wills it. He can slip in and out of other dimensions at will and even become invisible - so shapeshifting into the form of an animal is easy and means nothing to him. In fact, Dracula himself was presented in the novel to provide a contrast in that he was the complete  opposite  of technology because he was supernatural, from the \u201cOld World\u201d, and couldn\u2019t be explained. This scared the Victorian era characters like Mina Harker and the others because all they believed in was science, technology, and the progress associated with the industrial revolution and not in that which could not be explained via those means. Hence Van Helsing\u2019s quote in Dracula, \u201cDo not fear to think even the most not-probable.\u201d This is the advice which eventually helps Mina, Jonathan, Dr. Seward, and Quincy understand Dracula\u2019s supernatural nature and helps them make a plan on how to defeat Dracula.

What do I say when I see her next? My wife and two sons died in a car accident today. What should I do first? Why does one need to see a chiropractor after a car accident? What makes you cry more, a dog dying or your best friend dying? NO it is not stupid and immature to cry when your best friend dies. I was shocked when reading that your parents can THAT insensitive to you. If you don\u2019t have emotions to anyone, you would be classified as a socio/psychopath, with no emotion to anyone. Have your parents being abusive to you? If yes, please contact help. No it is never wrong to cry.  You can cry about anything, and it'll never be wrong. The death of someone   is nothing to be taken lightly. In fact, I'd be more surprised if someone didn't cry rather than if they did. You can cry whatever age, whatever time, whatever reason, and it's still okay to do so. As a parent of four, and a guy who has taught about grief recovery, I would be concerned about the mental state of any kid of mine who did NOT cry at the loss of a friend's life. BUT, I am not your parent. It might be enlightening to you to understand your parents' inability to sympathize or empathize with your loss. What conditions did they grow up in which make them adverse to grieving? Once you know that, you can pity them their inability to understand and move on...knowing that your displays of grief must be reserved for alone times, or with friends. In regards to Zelda, let me tell you I'm 61. There are onscreen deaths and other displays of reunification which still cause my tears to well up. Congratulations, you are human. Crying is a natural response when people are saddened by an emotionally powerful event. Losing a best friend is obviously both powerful (he\u2019s dead and it\u2019s irreversible) and emotional (if you didn\u2019t have feelings for him then he wouldn\u2019t be a friend). There\u2019s nothing wrong with showing your emotions. It helps you cope with difficult situations. Holding it in makes stress worse, and too much stress is very unhealthy both mentally and physically. If your parents are trying to raise you to be a heartless psychopath, then by all means suppress any emotions, but otherwise, it\u2019s very healthy to let your feelings out so you can deal with them. I\u2019m very disappointed in parents who would chastise their son for showing emotion to the point where they call you names and threaten to lock you up. Are they physically abusive too or just emotionally abusive?",

It means \u201ctake [it]\u201d Formal: \u201cTome\u201d (1 person), \u201ctomen\u201d (2 or more). \u201cToma\u201d is a little bit rude, I\u2019m convinced there is another common way, but I can\u2019t remember it now. Other way is more similar to English: \u201cAqu\u00ed/ah\u00ed tienes\u201d (informal, singular), \u201c\u2026 tienen\u201d (plural, Latin America), \u201c\u2026teneis (informal, plural, Spain).

        "a": "You don't have to be perfect (is that even possible?) or even very good in any branch of Mathematics when you start your course. You should ideally have a sufficiently good handle on the maths courses that you had during your high school and undergrad - at least the basic concepts, especially of Calculus, basic Graph Theory, basic Linear Algebra, basic Probability and Discrete Mathematics. But many students come in with a reasonably horrendous mathematical background, and most, if not all, students have big gaps in their knowledge because they do not come from colleges where maths is taught to IISc standards (like the IITs, CMI, ISI, IMSc etc). For most people (including yours truly), it is when they come to IISc that they realise how woefully inadequate their mathematics education was, especially with regards to a proof-based, logical and axiomatic approach. But what matters is that  you must be willing to learn . The department offers courses which are categorised into 3 pools - theory, systems and intelligent systems. If you are an M.Tech. student, the pool requirements themselves will ensure that you have to take a few \u201cmathematical\u201d courses - it may be Linear Algebra, Probability, Optimisation, Machine Learning, Graph Theory, Approximation Algorithms, Automata Theory or even Program Analysis and Verification (yes, many systems courses have maths as well). So don't worry too much about your previous maths background, which will most likely be inadequate, and  that's perfectly fine . It doesn't even matter if you are not very good at it (unless you want to do research in one of the more mathematical areas). What matters is that you must like (if not love) maths enough to learn whatever is needed to do well in your courses and complete your M.Tech. project, at the very least. If you are determined to avoid maths, you will: Suffer in courses due to the pool requirements. And don't let anybody tell you that GPA doesn't matter - it does, even if it is not the only important thing. Be very limited when choosing areas and topics for your M.Tech. project. If you want to prepare, please do concentrate on getting the basic concepts in the above areas extremely clear, especially precise definitions (instead of just a lot of \u201cintuitive\u201d stuff - trust me, it will help a lot). Also try to really \u201cget\u201d some of the basic proofs that you learned during your undergrad, like the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (almost certainly there in your Discrete Maths course). This will help immensely of you are willing to spend the time. You read the proof - do you understand why each step of the argument is needed, and why each step is done in that particular way? If a particular step is changed, what will happen to the proof? Hint: There are some good answers covering the theorem and the proof on Quora.  Seek and ye shall find . What do I do next after B.Tech in computer science. MBA or M.Tech? Is it true that computer science students prefer IIT-Bombay more for M.Tech. rather than IISC, Bangalore? Can I do Masters in mathematics in IISC if I give GATE in computer science? What's the prospect for the M.tech course in data computation and computer science available in IIT.KGP and how one from mathematics can fit i... Can I do M.Tech in computer science from IIT after B.Tech in civil engineering? Mathematics is not compulsory for getting admission in Mtech TA as IISc takes direct admission.

Besides, they are the result of ionic flow,  not  electric flow: what neurons do is to shuffle around Sodium and Potassium (and some Calcium) ions\u2014the electrons just follow their much heavier \u201cmasters\u201d, so they don\u2019t \u201cmove\u201d that much. In addition to that, a human brain can have many billions of neurons active at the same time, all firing away and superimposing one tiny electromagnetic disturbance over another: when using electrodes\u2014as in an EEG\u2014what we \u201csee\u201d is the tiny overall, average, ensemble electric fields we can pick up from outside the skull. There\u2019s already a lot of signal and resolution loss: we cannot tell apart individual neurons firing without actually inserting an electrode in a particular neuron. If having direct, close access to a brain enclosed in a skull is very far from enough to record the activity of individual neurons, what can one expect from the very long wavelength (in the order of 300 kilometers) and very weak electromagnetic disturbances coming from them? Besides, it is not possible to resolve electromagnetically (aka. \u201csee\u201d) signals originating from points separated by distances smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic signal. Given wavelengths in the order of 300 kilometers (186 miles), it is impossible to resolve individual sources (the neurons) separated by a thousandth of an inch or even less. TL;DR No. Not at all feasible. Is there any feasible way to render all human electronic communication useless? (such as electromagnetic pulses) How valid are the claims of people being victims of remote neural monitoring, if at all? What exactly is Remote Neural Monitoring? How is light made up of electric fields and magnetic fields? Why does a static charge show only in an electric field? Kilometers? Wow! That\u2019s a long way for a signal in the microvolt range to be detected, even if it were not as well insulated from interference as is a neuron. As Leo Mauro points out in his excellent answer, you have a few hundred million signals that all contribute to the signal you would measure, so even if you could detect it, you certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to \u201cdescramble\u201d the signal. So, no, not with our current technology. Centimeters or a few meters? Yes. Currently this done with fMRI, or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d. fMRI detects changes in blood flow that is correlated to neural activity, and does not actually detect the neuronal action potential. This means that the fMRI signal has a slight time delay of a few seconds between the neuronal firing and the signal detection. Also, the fMRI signal has a spacial resolution (voxel size) of a few millimeters, so this means that it measures the activity of tens of thousands, perhaps even millions, of neurons. Despite these constraints, fMRI has been a tremendous research tool as it can provide non-invasive near real-time recordings of brain activity.",

        "a": "Which myth is that? That talent doesn\u2019t exist? If that is the one, then it is obsolete as multiple GWAS have shown correlations between genetic variations and the traits we would call talent. There are several studies showing that an accumulation of genes specifically related to athletic talent are present in elite athletes. Other studies show that deliberate training accounts for only a fraction of variance depending on the domain field studied. Don\u2019t get me wrong, without training all the potential in the world will not be effective - talent is the potential realized after it is in contact with epigenetic and/or environmental stimuli - but if you don\u2019t have that potential in enough strength, it is unlikely you will reach a level of mastery in a field. Most \u201ctalents\u201d have multiple, maybe hundreds, of genetic variations associated with them and if you have those variations then you will have some talent in that direction depending on a number of factors including how many variations you have. It also depends on other more subtle factors such as how training effects some of the upstream genetic variations and how the environment triggers other genes that determine response to training. Most skills can be taught given enough time, but what you are talking about probably requires multiple skills. Simple skills can be learned in a matter of hours for most people, but even then if they have none of the variations related to those skills, it can be hard. What is the most useless talent/skill? What should I do to find my talents and skills? I am 23 and it feels like I have no skills or talents. Is teaching a skill that can be taught? Do you believe that poetry can be a taught skill?

What should I give him? I want it to be memorable and different. Handwritten cards are always close to heart. Key points: Attach your photographs to the card. Rich handwriting is a plus point. Use multiple colours of ink to differentiate portions of the card or like emotions. Start with how close he's to you and how much you love and respect him. Write about his life since the start and how he has evolved to be the individual he's today. Write about how he has influenced in anyway ( True stories only) The ending of the card should be just from the heart. No clue for that. Happy card making. You have limited you options to the card. So I'll advise you in that domain only. You could either go for handmade cards. For making it either search google or YouTube. Youtube has many different types like the infinity card etc. Or you could go to some card shop and buy it- small or big- your wish",

        "a": "IMHO, you should learn HTML and CSS quite well. You will have to know those whenever you touch the front end. Bootstrap, on the other hand, is not that important. Yes, it is great, and you should know - at least to some degree - what it does and how it does that. Bonus points if you know the difference between Bootstrap and one of it\u2019s competitors, like Foundation. Is it possible to get a job as a Web developer with only a knowledge of HTML and CSS and no JavaScript? I don't have any prior knowledge of CSS and JavaScript, but I have good knowledge of PHP and HTML. Can I become a good web developer? I have average knowledge about HTML and CSS. Do i next go for learning Bootstrap or JavaScript for career in freelancing? How do I become a full-stack software developer? I have no prior knowledge of software. Can I call myself a full stack web developer if I know HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JS and a little of AngularJS? In order to become a full stack JavaScript developer, you would need to have a good understanding of vanilla JavaScript. For front end development you would need a working knowledge of  Angular ,  React  or  other similar frameworks . For backend development you would need good understanding of  nodejs  and some frameworks like  express , which is built for nodejs. HTML, CSS and bootstrap knowledge will help you in becoming a better front end developer but you would need JavaScript to become a Full Stack JavaScript developer. You can try the  Full Stack Javascript track  on  FreeCodeCamp  as it will help you a lot. Labeling yourself as a full stack developer means that you are capable of creating a web application all on your own. Front end and backend. I recommend having a solid knowledge of front-end and back-end technologies. Being a capable full stack developer required an extensive knowledge of html and css, bootstrap does make some things easier but I don't recommend you spend too much time learning it. Best of luck! Well since HTML and CSS are a part of the \u201cstack\u201d, you better know them well. It obviously all depends on the type of work you\u2019re doing to have to do, but I\u2019ll try to answer in general. I\u2019d say HTML is not a big issue anyway, unless you need good understanding of semantic tags or some more multimedia-related stuff, but that is rather specialized and still, HTML should be quick and easy enough to grasp. CSS on the other hand is going to be useful in your career at some point anyway, so I\u2019d recommend you get a solid understanding of it if possible. Again, if you do more backend work and have someone strictly on the front then it\u2019s probably not that crucial, but dealing with CSS can be time consuming and irritating in complex projects if you don\u2019t get know it in and out, and also you need to maintain the same project for some time which will make you mad at yourself later if you don\u2019t have a solid, neat design. When it comes to bootstrap, it\u2019s just one of the tools, and not so widely used as you may think, at least in web apps. Unless you\u2019re specifically told to use it and know it on the job/project, there is a ton of alternatives, and the chance that you will be required/allowed or even want to use bootstrap are not that big, so to answer your question - probably none.",

Christianity in its fundamentals is neither legalistic nor ascetic although certain religious groups have adopted both legalism and asceticism as sectarian distinctives. The clearest statement of that difference in recent years came from a person that many evangelical Christians regard scornfully, Barack Obama: According to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned. Grace is not merited. It\u2019s not something we deserve. Rather, grace is the free and benevolent favor of God \u2013 as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings. Grace.  The moment Barack Obama summed up the mood of a nation after the murder of 9 black church members The knock against Christianity ( a very small percentage even follow basic tenets ) is particularly true to someone who lives a life based on submission to a creed that defines virtually every aspect of life and relationships. There are really only two ironclad tenets to Christianity, to love God and love one another: (\u201cTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?\u201dJesus replied: \u201c\u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\u2019 This is the first and greatest commandment.And the second is like it: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\u201d Matthew 22) While the one credo is based on freedom, the other is based on voluntary submission (Islam means voluntary submission to Allah).",

        "a": "Sorry, can\u2019t answer your question because, I have no idea what \u201cbehavioural economics\u201d is. The term has to be a misnomer because, \u201ceconomics\u201d is a pseudo \u201cscience\u201d about money that has proven, over the decades, to be an abject failure in trying to help society improve itself. Prossibly, the purpose of \u201ceconomics\u201d hasn\u2019t been to improve society, maybe it\u2019s purpose has been to ensure the status quo is maintained for the people with \u201cmoney\u201d so that the class system will continue to prevail. Why else is \u201ceconomics\u201d shrouded in such a cloak of mysticism, a multidue of concocted ideas, and strange words that only the initiated can interpret. But if \u201ceconomics\u201d is about \u201cmoney\u201d - and what else can it be about - why is it that the most fundamental consideration of this pseudo science is an unquestionable and unalterable given that no trained economist is ever allowed to discuss - namely - how is money created, who owns it and who should control its issuing? Money is created for one single purpose - irrespective of what the \u201cexperts\u201d have to say - money is created as a convenient medium of exchange. Money is totally useless if it cannot be exchanged for something that is needed or wanted. Money has no intrinsic value other than in what it can be exchanged for. Money is not a \u201ccommodity\u201d despite the stupidity of the modern day foreign exchange markets that are nothing more than huge gambling casinos. For any token to function as \u201cmoney\u201d it must have two fundamental properties - first it must be generally and universally accepted within a given community - and secondly - it must come with some level of guarantee that it is not counterfeit. And who, in our modern era, can provide both of these funfdamental properties? Obviously, only the Government of the nation is in a position to determine what can act as the single universal token for a nation. Only the Government has the power and authority to guarantee its authenticity as legal tender, by punishing anyone who tries to counterfeit the tokens. Thus, as a Government is, in truth, a creation of the people, it means that the creation of a nation\u2019s money supply is really a responsibility the people grant their Government to manage in a way that the productive capacity of the nation can be balanced against that nation\u2019s consumption capacity. there is no other criteria for determining the level of a nation\u2019s money supply. Both the productive and consumption capacity will, in turn, be determined by the nation\u2019s population growth, and/or decline. There is absolutely no point in producing anything, anything at all, whether it is products or services, if they are not going to be consumed. If consumption isn\u2019t the purpose of production then the exercise is a waste of time, money, resources and energy. Which is the best economic system and why? Aren't these privacy wars a consent for the elite to monitor our behavior since they already know the economic system is not fair for the majo... What are examples of the basic economic systems? Which economic system is the best to follow? Is the economic system fair to everyone? Your question doesn't seem to clearly explain which \u201csystems\u2019 you are talking about. Although it seems you are referring to Daniel kahneman\u2019s(Nobel laureate) two systems that were aimed to analyze the argument of rationality in human behavior. System 1 is the one that sort of means we go on auto-pilot and can take decisions immediately. This can come either because the tasks are trivial (such as eating) or done repeatedly or we have practise them enough ( for example driving). System 2 reflects the decision making that is slow and takes into account numerous things before arriving at a solution. For example, solving a mathematical equation. Kahneman had Infact found that your pupils dilate when your brain is out to some activity revealing that the effort taken to arrive at such a solution. An example may clarify the difference , picking which stock to invest on after due diligence is system 2 at work while picking a stock because you feel so (your gut feeling) is system 1. Thus, human decision making can be both rational and irrational depending on which system is in place.",

        "a": "Chinese, no doubt about it. For starters, the Chinese language contains thousands of characters. Sure, you \u201conly\u201d have learn about 2\u20133000 of those, but that will still keep you busy for countless hours. Second, Chinese is tonal language, which means that you have  four different tones  which you have to learn to distinguish, both when listening and when speaking. This takes time, believe me. I had loads of misunderstandings with locals before getting a grip of the tones. On the other hand, Korean only has a limited amount of  characters , (24 I believe) which you can use in a similar way as we use our alphabet. In other words, they spell out their words, rather than having one or two characters being a whole word in itself (as in Chinese). This makes reading Korean really fast and easy to learn. Korean also has no tones, which makes it easier getting used to speaking and listening. However, in Korean, they way you speak changes quite a lot, depending on who you talk to (elder, someone of equal age, younger, etc.). This would be the aspect where Korean is more difficult than Chinese. This being said, I never regret having chosen Chinese as my language to study. It\u2019s really interesting once you get used to how characters are formed (there\u2019s a logic to it, most of the times!) and many of the words are connected in a logic way. For example, \u7535\u8111 (Dian4Nao3), which means \u201ccomputer\u201d is made up from the characters \u7535(dian4), meaning \u201celectric\u201dand \u8111 (nao3), meaning \u201cbrain\u201d. So \u201cElectric brain\u201d = Computer. Chinese is filled with these fun little easter eggs. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t studied much Korean. What I know is mainly based on conversations with my Korean classmates back in China. I hope my answer could help you understand some basic differences though! What's a harder language for an English speaker to learn? I want to learn Chinese from scratch. I speak English and Korean. Where do I begin? Is it harder to learn Chinese or English? Which language is harder to learn for an English speaker, Armenian or Turkish? How hard is it to learn Korean for a native speaker both of Chinese and Japanese? I totally agree with Danny Jun Li's answer. I cannot tell which is difficult by language features (and because I am a native Japanese speaker, I feel Chinese characters easy, Korean grammar easy, so I cannot make a fair comparison) I just believe in an assumption that most languages are equally difficult because who speak it is same human :) If there were a language for superhuman being, that will definitely be harder for us to learn. What I would want to add is that there is one thing definitely separates Korean and Mandarin: speaker population. Mandarin is a so diverse language that is spoken not only in China, but also in Malaysia, Singapore, chinatowns around the glove etc etc... Because Mandarin is more diverse language, you are OK to make a mistake (or some mistake might not be recognized as a mistake but just as a difference.) In Korean there is less room for mistake. List of no-no's like Panmal. There are lots of \"mistakes\" you might make. (Japanese language is similar... no offense...) Moreover, because Mandarin has high influence, you have better learning materials on Mandarin than Korean. So I assume  Mandarin  a bit  easier. P.S. In terms of language feature, I want to add that Chinese character is hard at entrance, but easy to master. Most words, especially technical and medical terms are comprised of easier characters without any modification of each components. If you want to just read some street signboards, Korean is definitely easier. If you want to go further, maybe Mandarin is your friend. For  most  English speakers who don\u2019t speak any other language, Chinese will be harder. But Korean will still be hard too. Chinese grammar is easier. Some find it incredibly easy. Personally I struggle with it. But Korean grammar is really complicated. It\u2019s much more alien to English than Chinese\u2019s grammar is. If you really want to master it you will have to learn the subtle politeness levels that even many native speakers can have difficulties with. Korean reading and writing is vastly easier. Hangul is probably the easiest writing system to learn of any language. A couple of hours is typical. A couple of days if you\u2019re a poor student. Spelling is not straightforward though, but not a nightmare like English spelling. Chinese reading and writing takes years. Fun years if you happen to like it but it\u2019s not fast for anybody. Chinese and Korean both have a vowel or two that English doesn\u2019t have and a few consonants each that English doesn\u2019t have. Chinese Pinyin hides a lot of complications of Chinese pronunciation unless you have a very good teacher so watch out! Also, the further you are from Beijing, the more you will be surrounded by people with very different accents, even different Chinese languages if you\u2019re in the southeast. Korean on the other hand has a lot less confusing accent variation other than Jeju island. But Chinese has tones and Korean does not. This is a whole alien dimension for an English speaker. Most people telling you tones are easy are native Chinese speakers who learned since infancy, or are westerners who have not been given honest appraisals of how inaccurate their tones really are by native speakers. Having said that, if you get your tones half right you\u2019ll be a lot easier to understand by native speakers. With all respect but I would like to say - that anyone who is 100% sure about 1 language is harder than other is not correct. In this universe, all the languages are having similar parameters which must be ruled under the structure of its own grammar. There is no way to compare which is above which. - However, how easy to learn a language (or how difficult), it depends on the individual\u2019s thought process and ability to learn, it also depends on who teach the language to this individual. Here is what I would do when you have a question like this: > Which language are you interested in more? Interest could drive up the motivation significantly. > What is your purpose to pick up that language? Because your interests is in their culture? Again, which attracts your more, which might be easier for you. > How are you going to create opportunities to get practice? A group of friends? - among all of your friends, which language has more learners than another? (Unless you want to pick up one language skill and expertise it for a living, that\u2019s a different story) > Give a try to those free-lessons on both languages and check which one you have a \u201cclick\u201d.

Education is not a one shot thing. It\u2019s a continuous activity, you\u2019ll learn through all your life ! And it\u2019s a good thing actually. Don\u2019t you want to become smarter ?

But the way it's implemented, it depends on you. The mark on your graduation certificate will just represent that you do all your duty. A lot of student are good in theory, but not all of them are good in real life. Just keep trying never give up, and you will earn something equal as your fight. Definitely not. Success comes primarily hard work, determination, and luck. Case in point - my dad was not the top student in his school and was not accepted into a top school, but 20 years later, he is earning twice as much as the valedictorian of his high school who went to the best college in the country.",

For example: I am trying to get along with my girlfriend, I feel like she feels insecure when with me. Or, yesterday there was a fighting between my parents and I and I am trying to fix it.

Can you Uber from Los Angeles to New York? Drinks. You can get margaritas and bloody Mary (and other alcoholic drinks) on the Catalina Express. I must be missing something here. Let me review. Catalina is an island. You cannot drive to,it because there isn't a bridge. You can take your own boat, if you have one. You can pay someone to take you on their boat, or you can tak the ferry. There is no airport, but you could pay someone to fly you on a helicopter to the island. This is something you Should do if you are in LA but be for warned. My father who was not only a Marine but a merchant Marine, before WW2, sat with my mom, her coat rapped around both of them as closed to the middle of the ship as possible.This is called the straights of Catalina and they can be quit rough.

        "a": "I\u2019ve noticed on Quora a lot of these relatively trivial questions, and I avoid answering anything mathematical unless I can see what the questioner has tried to do, and why they got stuck or failed to see the way through. Without that information, it is difficult to help. Answering, instead, merely looks like an exercise in self congratulation, rather than an attempt to teach, which is what Quora ought to be about. If the query is in fact a troll, then the proper response is none, anyway. If it isn\u2019t, then more information should be a matter of course. In this case, all that has to be done is ask the questioner what \u201cdivisible by 2\u201d means, and how that relates to addition. The result almost immediately falls out, then. For  [math]n^2=2^n[/math] , how do you find n? For what positive integral  [math]n[/math]  is\u00a0  [math]\\frac{3n^3 + 3}{3n^2 + n - 2}[/math]  an integer? How do I show that  [math]n^2-3n-19[/math]  is not a multiple of  [math]289[/math]  for any integer  [math]n?[/math] How do I prove that there does not exist positive integers  [math]a, b, c[/math]  and  [math]n[/math]  such that  [math]a^2+b^2+c^2 = 2^n abc?[/math] How can we prove that if we divide N by 1, 2, 3, ..., N then we can get at most 2 * sqrt(N) different integer quotients? f(n) = 3n^2 + n^n - 2 Case:1 If n is an even number then n^(any positive integer) is even. So n^(n) and n^2 are even => 3n^2 is even Sum of even numbers is even and reducing 2 from it is an even number which is divisible by 2. Hence for n= even, f(n) is divisible by 2 Case:2 If n is an odd number then n^(any positive integer) is odd. So n^(n) and n^2 are odd=> 3n^2 is odd Sum of odd numbers is even and reducing 2 from it is an even number which is divisible by 2. Hence for n= odd, f(n) is divisible by 2. Finally f(n) is divisible by 2 for all positive integer value of n f(n) =  3(n^2)  +  n^n  -  2 If  n  is an Even Number, then  3(n^2)  and  n^n  will also be Even. Therefore, f(n) =  3(n^2)  +  n^n  -  2 = Even + Even - 2 = Even + Even - Even =  Even So if  n  is Even, then f(n) is Divisible by 2 If n is an Odd Number, then  3(n^2)  and  n^n  will also be Odd. Therefore, f(n) =  3(n^2)  +  n^n  -  2 = Odd + Odd - 2 = Odd + Odd - Even = Even + Even =  Even So  f(n) =  3(n^2)  +  n^n  -  2  is Divisible by  2  for a Positive Integer value of  n If n id even, it is obvious. If n is odd, make n=2k+1 Then 3(2k+1)^2 + (2k+1)^(2k+1) -2 = 12k^2+12k +3 + (2k+1)^(2k+1) -2. 3 is odd, (2k+1)^(2k+1) is odd, their sum is even.

Let me quote from the Wikia entry for  Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b [1] Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki  is a powerful  Batt\u014djutsu  technique whose secret lies in discovering both the significance and insignificance of one's life, the penultimate requirement needed to master the  Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b. Though its form is that of any other  Batt\u014djutsu  strike, the  Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki  differs in that - while a normal strike is performed by drawing the  katana  from its sheath on one side while stepping forward with the opposite foot, using a single step - However, this strike adds yet another step (a second step) mid-draw with the foot adjacent to the sheath (creating a Stutter-Step) which momentarily creates an instantaneous acceleration to the forward-charge as well as the sword draw. Meanwhile, the range of the attack is increased and the Timing of the attack changes slightly, which can throw off the opponent, Although truly, a super-sword attack, it endangers the user by possibly putting the adjacent leg into the free sword's path and draws one even closer to an opponent's sword than usual, but on the other hand, boosts the Speed of the sword draw to beyond-Godspeed and even greater is the boost in force of the strike. By realizing one's insignificance and risking life and limb to protect something else while, at the same time, taking one's own, fragile human life into consideration, the user is able to step into the small margin behind one's own drawn sword and in front of the sword of one's opponent without fail, delivering a beyond-godspeed blow of monstrous power. Additionally, like other  Batt\u014djutsu  moves of  Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b ,  Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki  is a two-step move and, if its secret should be anticipated and the strike itself blocked or dodged, the second step comes immediately into effect. The immense force of the enhanced draw cuts the air in front of it and creates a powerful vacuum in its wake as the deflected air rushes back into place. Any opponent to deflect or dodge the first swing will automatically be subject to this vacuum and inexorably pulled closer to the user, all the while this vacuum creates intense winds powerful enough to overwhelm and catch their opponents off balance. With the great amount of force being applied to the  Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki , a missed swing leads naturally into an accelerated spin of such centripetal force akin to the  Ry\u016bkansen . The added momentum of the spin in addition to the pulling force of the vacuum on both side results in a second strike that greatly dwarfs the first in power. This is best explained to Kaoru by Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d XIII: \"Even if you avoid the fangs of the flying dragon the gusting winds strip away freedom of movement and the claws would rip you apart\". Although the  Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki  is one of the most powerful and profound attacks of the series, to learn such a technique is not without its weaknesses, cost and consequence. Those who learn the ways of  Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b , and walks its path long enough to learn this technique, must undergo a final test, to be pitted against their master's unrestrained  Kuzury\u016bsen , placing them in a true life or death situation. Faced with life or death, the student must perform the  Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki  without flaw, being the only attack in the repertoire of  Hiten Mitsurugi  that surpasses the  Kuzury\u016bsen  in speed and execution- else the apprentice fails and is ultimately slain for naught. Should they succeed, they will have mastered both this technique, and how it is testament, the entire style of  Hiten Mitsurugi  itself, but at the cost of the preceding master's life. While the attack is incredibly powerful and seemingly unbeatable, the basis of  Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki , the fighter's will to live and compassion for others allowing them to stand on the edge of life or death, must be strong, free, and unwavering of any doubt and turmoil that lies in the heart of the user. This state of mind is the only condition that will allow the  Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki  to be executed flawlessly and guarantee their victory, as being out of this state only allows the user to execute lesser and flawed versions of the ultimate technique (as is the case when Kenshin faces Yukishiro Enishi and his  Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki  fails for the first and only time against the  Wat\u014djutsu ougi  Kufuku Zettousei). The  Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki  is first seen being used by Kenshin against Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d XIII, and his master is the only known master in the school's history to have survived the final trial. Its second strike is first seen being used by Kenshin against Aoshi Shinomori. Yukishiro Enishi is the only other opponent who has faced this technique twice. In the manga, it was stated the  Amakakeru Ry\u016b no Hirameki  can kill even with a  Sakabat\u014d . In the anime, it was not stated directly, but it was hinted when Seijur\u014d Hiko explained why he didn't die from being hit with the attack. Footnotes [1]  Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b",

        "a": "My top 4 hacks (and they're all  FREE ): 1) I use  Dropbox (product)   to work and sync from home or to collaborate with other teachers at my school. Teaching is a 24/7 profession and being able to work on a lesson plan or student resource at home and have it open and ready to print when you get to school in the morning is beautiful.  2) I use a  Google Voice (product)  number for student and parent contact. You can send mass texts out to parents informing them of upcoming quizzes and tests. You can send quick texts out to certain parents when you need to update or inform them of something regarding their child. You can answer homework questions using a computer keyboard - very beneficial as a math teacher. You can also have the calls/texts forwarded to your personal cell phone while still controlling the times and days that you allow forwarding (i.e. not after 9PM and not on weekends). 3)  BetterLesson  is by far the best source for lesson resources. The quality of the lessons on that site is 10x that of any comparable site and it is extremely user friendly.  4)  www.engrade.com  is the best web based gradebook. It has a ton of really great features. Students and parents can create their own accounts so you never have to be asked \"What's my grade?!\" Students can chat with teachers and each other about projects and assignments. Teachers can upload content. What can make you effective teacher? What are habits, tips, routines, or hacks that you notice have had an effect on your appearance? Do teachers ship students? What are some effective self-discovery hacks? What are some mind hacks? Trust your students. Know that they are capable of doing good - wonderful things (academic and social and emotional). Feeling some connectedness with the students. Being able to explain stuff in various ways, being flexible (e.g. using the interest or the family members or \u2026 of a student to explain something) Being an example of using humor: let them know you don\u2019t think less of them after \u2018troublesome times\u2019. A genuine rolmodel. Story of my College !! I study at SRM University,NCR Campus,currently in 3rd year B.Tech(CSE).So,This hack works for you only if you are a teacher,and have hard times controlling students. In my class its really a tedious task for teachers to maintain discipline(silence) in the class and Moreover to grab the attention of the teachers and get responses from them. As all of us feel too lazy to give responses,as commited do shona babu c***zpa overnight and singles are busy scrolling Fb and making SnapChats(The new Trend in) So,what teachers usually do is\u2026They recite a word and it always works magic,Any guesses? Ready to hear it? You sure?? Okay,Finally Its time. That magical word is : \u201c Placement \u201d As soon as this word is recited 2\u20133 times there is complete silence in the class and curosity gets to its peak.Fuck,every other thing then,Nothing is important. But,as this trick was fading in ( Of course,after being used for such a long time),a new trend is in named IoT our so called,Internet of Things.I\u2019m damn sure most of us doesn\u2019t know about it,(neither do we give a fuck).But,as soon as the word is pronounced we are all ready to share our little knowledge and to talk about advancing India.

        "a": "It is a device that uses electricity to produce some ozone in gas. It can be battery powered, but is usually wall-powered. The gas can be just atmospheric air, in which case these are called \u201cionizers\u201d. Most commonly they are fed dry air, dry oxygen, or oxygen from an oxygen concentrator. If the gas stream is not dry, significant oxides of nitrogen are formed, which gum up the interior of the ozone generator\u2019s cell, and may actually destroy some of the materials-of-construction. Some commercial ozone generators run under vacuum, most under pressure. Ozone production is about 4% thermally efficient when making ozone in air, and about 8% when making ozone in oxygen or concentrated oxygen. So significant cooling is required. Cooling is via either moving and heating lots of air, or by flowing water through the ozone production cell, which gets a little tricky, since usually a few thousand (high frequency units) to several thousand (line frequency units) volts are required to make the \u201cplasma\u201d that dissociates oxygen and nitrogen. And some minimal amount of nitrogen (or argon) is required to make ozone, which is not a problem for anything except LOX (liquid oxygen) or GOX (gaseous oxygen) systems. Ozone is most commonly produced in the DECAY of N2O5, into N2, O2, and O3. This happens in ozone generators, and in the ozone layer too. And yes, there are UV-based ozone generators as well, but they are limited to low concentration, have fairly high maintenance costs (periodic replacement of special quartz-enclosed mercury vapor fluorescent tubes), and are less efficient than most \u201ccorona\u201d-based units\u2026 especially when gas costs are figured in.",

        "a": "Here \u2019s someone, apparently a former lawyer, who writes: But with our president acting in ways that can most charitably be called \u201cnot normal\u201d and talk of impeachment is in the air, it is probably time to ask whether the insanity defense could prevent Donald Trump from being impeached in the House or convicted in the Senate. The insanity plea doesn\u2019t work in all crimes. Some crimes require a mental element (called  mens rea ) before an accused can be found guilty. First degree murder, for example, requires the perp to intend the action. Intention is a mental state, so the insanity plea is relevant. Involuntary manslaughter doesn\u2019t have a mental element because the crime is (duh) involuntary. The insanity plea is not used in involuntary manslaughter. What about impeachment? Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution defines impeachment as follows: The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. Since the Constitution defines impeachment by referring to the listed crimes of treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors (that are presumably defined by the House in their articles of impeachment). Treason is defined in the Constitution in Article III, Section 3, as follows: Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. The other crimes are not defined in the Constitution. Bribery generally is considered to be receiving payment or other benefit in exchange for changing your behavior in an official act. Should Trump be accused of other high crimes or misdemeanors, we\u2019d have to look at the definitions of those crimes to see how an insanity defense would be applied. Should the insanity defense be ruled admissible, the following questions might be asked: Did Donald Trump have a mental disease or defect relevant to the actions he would be accused of? Did Donald Trump know his actions were wrong? Did Donald Trump understand the nature of his actions? Even if Donald Trump knew his actions were wrong, was he able to control his actions? So, I guess he could  use  the insanity defense, but whether it would be successful or even allowed is another question entirely. What are the chances of Donald Trump's impeachment? If the House impeaches Trump, can Mitch McConnell refuse to hear the case in the Senate (like he did for Obama's SCOTUS appointment)? If Trump becomes president, can't the House just choose to impeach him? Will Trump actually be impeached? And if so, can he be put in jail? Would Congress try to impeach Donald Trump if he is elected president? This is a lovely question, that could lead to full employment for Constitutional lawyers for a generation. Politicians, as well as politically minded jurists, love to argue about Originalism, or Textualism, or the notion of Living Documents, but the simple fact is that, under our system, the Constitution and the laws promulgated under it mean exactly what the courts, and especially the Supreme Court, say they mean. The insanity defense sometimes allows a loophole for almost any crime, because courts have ruled that you can\u2019t hold somebody criminally responsible for a crime, if their mental state and capability does not enable them to guide or control their actions. Could that apply here? It\u2019s a stretch, but stretching previous decisions and opinions is what lawyers do. A lawyer could even say, as he has said about his conflicts of interest, that the voters knew he was impulsive before they elected him, so the House has no business overruling the electorate. On the other hand, one could argue that impeachment isn\u2019t a criminal proceeding, and it is not at all about holding anybody criminally responsible. It is simply about removing from office somebody who is too dangerous to the Republic to allow him to remain in office. I could support that by noting that impeachment implies no other punishment besides removal, and that any other punishment would require further criminal trial. However, the Constitution doesn\u2019t actually say that, and all of the grounds for impeachment are crimes, so that is a bit of a stretch as well. One could argue that any President trying to hold off an impeachment with an insanity defense is effectively invoking Amendment XXV, Section 3. This is where the President declares himself to be (possibly temporarily) incapable of performing as President. In that case, the VP becomes acting President. This would be a mess, because it does not allow the country to replace the VP, and would, at least in theory, allow the President to revoke that declaration at any time. Pragmatically, it would be better if it were to be found that such a declaration did not prevent the actual impeachment from going forward. First reaction upon reading this question: ROFL! But seriously folks, an insanity defense is no defense when it comes to impeachment. If the Donald would be put to trial in the Senate and he pleads insanity, it would have proved that he was not fit to hold office in the first place, and would be subject under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, in part: Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President. In short, he would be busted if he\u2019ll do that. I don\u2019t think so. Remember, a Senate trial isn\u2019t a criminal trial\u2014we\u2019re not talking about putting him in prison. (If he\u2019s guilty of crimes that would put you or me in prison, that\u2019s to be dealt with in a separate criminal trial.) A Senate trial is to determine whether his behavior is such as to demand that he be removed from office. For that, arguing that he\u2019s insane is more or less conceding the point. Irrelevant - the most the Senate can do is remove him from office - a claim of insanity will bring about the same result.",

This is not acceptable to India. Further, China cautions India that by not joining, India is losing out on benefits. These benefits are potential as projected by China. India may not see any reliability in those attractions. India\u2019s relations with China are not congenial, China hurts India wherever it can. In such conditions, India doesn\u2019t like to join China in its plans.",

The very flat surfaces means that there is virtually no air trapped between the surfaces when they are joined; steel blocks also have a thin layer of oil on the surface and the combination of air pressure and surface tension of the oil was long thought to be the reason.

        "a": "The best strategy would be to incorporate more  healthy energy-dense foods  into your diet. Energy density is defined as how much calories a food contains per gram of food. Very energy dense foods are nuts (and butter made out of nuts like peanut butter, cashew butter, and almond butter), seeds, fattier cuts of meat, whole milk and dairy (not fat-free!), fattier fish. I\u2019ve already compiled a list of  the best 79 foods to gain weight . Check it out! A good strategy would also be to try and  drink your calories instead of eating them  because drinking calories is way easier than eating them. I would suggest incorporating milk and fruit juices. The last thing I would recommend is  eating less food with higher amounts of fibre . Fibre is great for general health, but getting in more fibre than is required could be hurting your weight gain progress as fibre is very filling. Consider switching from whole wheat pasta to white pasta, from brown rice to white rice etc. And if you\u2019re wondering whether or not you need a  weight gainer  to bulk up, I\u2019ve discussed this topic  here . Hope this helps! MassWithClass \u2013 Exercise And Nutrition Tips for Gaining Mass.  If you want to gain mass, size, and strength or just generally look and feel better, then you\u2019ve come to the right place! How could I gain weight in a healthy way? Is it safe to eat huge amounts of food to gain body weight? How one can lose weight without going to the gym? What kind of foods do I eat to gain weight? I'm prone to gaining weight in my stomach. What foods should I be eating to avoid this? I would say eating hefty amounts of fatty or carb-heavy foods right before going to sleep or at night would definitely result in weight gain. You gain weight when you simply  consume more calories than you burn . By increasing your daily caloric intake and reducing your activity you should gain weight. Eating more of foods that are healthy but nonetheless caloric such as avocados, nuts, butter, and whole wheat grains will help. Briefly, eat more later in the day, exercise less and increase your portion sizes. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard. I assume you want lean weight gain.  The key is to create a need for that extra physical development\u2026. that means intense exercise. Focus on the exercise. Intensity will trigger a need for more physical development. Accept that it will take time\u2026. years but you should notice good results beginning within a few weeks. Keep the exercise relatively short ( under 30mins ) but really push for intensity. Keep to a routine, even if you don\u2019t feel like starting\u2026 do the 30mins. Create the internal hunger, then\u2026. Then eat good quality food  after  the exercise. Do not cram more protein into your meals. Just normal food, but good quality, nutrient rich. e.g. lentil instead of white-rice, green veg instead of fruit, avocado instead of any starchy snack, etc. Track your macro\u2019s eat at least 6 meals a day Weigh yourself daily in the morning and keep track of this. You will gain weight if you eat above your maintenance level. You can calculate this online. Also it depends if you wanna gain fat or muscle, eat accordingly.",

        "a": "It is in reference to the 1963 movie \u201cLa fin del mundo\u201d directed by Emilio Vieyra. \u201cFin del Mundo\u201d is the fictional name of a slum in Buenos Aires which means \u201cthe end of the world\u201d. In Argentina these poor slums are called \u201cVillas miseria\u201d (poverty towns), or simply \u201cvillas\u201d. Since \u201cvilla\u201d is feminin thence \u201cLa\u201d. To be better understood, the title should be written \u201cLa \u2018Fin del Mundo\u2019\u201d (in capitals because it is a proper name).  Here is a link to the lyrics, which obviously talk about poor slum . What does the word Mundo mean in Spanish? When do you need to use \"El\" and \"La\" in Spanish? Why is \"La Brea\" a feminine term in Spanish? As in, why does it have \"la\" instead of \"el\"? Why does the word \"el\" exist in Spanish? What does \u201cEl Rey y yo\u201d mean in Spanish? It\u2019s an archaism. Like writing \u201c Ye olde friend \u201d.  Fin  was a feminine word in Spanish until the 17th century: Pero, a  la fin , sin dubda no soy Coplas a la muerte de su padre , 1477. Y a  la fin  va la comedia de Santa Madrona. Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, 1638. Several words switched gender in that century, like  guardia . That is the reason  fin  is still a feminine word in French or Catalan. Most probably, an interference from Italian. If I understand this dictionary entry [1]  correctly, \u201cfine\u201d can be either male or feminine in Italian, but the meaning changes: Masculine \u201cfine\u201d is a purpose Feminine \u201cfine\u201d is the end of something We don\u2019t have such change in meaning with the change of gender in Spanish, our \u201cfin\u201d is always masculine and can mean both an objective and the edge/end of something. So just mentally adjust it to \u201cLa fine del mondo\u201d and it\u2019ll be just fine. Footnotes [1]  fine - Dizionario italiano-inglese WordReference",

        "a": "I, as an honest Tax Payer of India,  am NOT AT ALL WORRIED  about Sachin Tendulakar\u2019s Rajya Sabha\u2019s absence . And I need not be a Sachin Bhakt or a Fan to say that. Because I am very practical. Sachin Tendulkar appointment was more like  Brand Value-Add or a Glamour Add  to the Government than anything else. Before we say anything against Sachin, first the people who appointed him should be asked. You can then ask, \u201cWhy Sachin should accept that?\u201d Answer is very simple. If not Sachin some other celebrity will be offered. When the slot for a glamour role, they will get someone anyway. Then why not Sachin? What is a Rajya Sabha? Rajya Sabha is upper house and not a people elected House. Ideally the purpose of Rajya Sabha is to have a group of experts from many fields of knowledge so that they can bring more meaningful contribution/debate/discussion to the bills/topics that are tabulated. What is happening in Rajya Sabha today? People who don\u2019t have capability to get elected by people\u2019s vote are getting elected as Rajya Sabha member as a back door way , to say it very frank. Now, in Sachin\u2019s case\u2026. He is really eligible for that \u201crole of an expert in a field\u201d. He is eligible for the post unlike many others who as I explained earlier are back door specialists. Sachin is sportsman in general and champion cricketer in particular. I don\u2019t have any regrets in his appointment. Coming back to the absenteeism. Tell me how many sports topics/sport related bills come to House? Out of them how many need participation/debate from Sachin?  How many bills were incompletely passed as an outcome of Sachin\u2019s absence in House which would have averted had Sachin was present in the House ? Let us think practically\u2026 Then the next question that pops is \u201cSachin should have involvement in not just Sports matters, but also in other matters\u201d. I agree. But again come to practical world. If we really speak bluntly, any bill can be passed as long as you have majority, it really doesn\u2019t matter what you discuss, what you debate, what you cry, what you shout in the House, against it as long as you don\u2019t have majority. So, Sachin won\u2019t have anything to contribute for a topic of civil law, criminal law etc. Even if he contributes something, that is not any way considered as \u201cpulse of people\u201d or an \u201cexpertly advise\u201d. He doesn\u2019t have anything to say  other than tapping the tables, if his colleague is speaking in the House , whether he likes or understands it or not. Do we have any instance where a bill is not getting passed because of Sachin\u2019s non availability in House? Even, if he wants to vote he can\u2019t naturally vote against to Congress party which elected him. Instead, of spending of hours of inactivity in Parliament, even a 5 minutes time with an upcoming cricketer can be a mightiest thing of the person\u2019s career, so I don\u2019t feel any problem with his absenteeism. Of course, he can always resign if he can\u2019t justify but as I said in the start, if not Sachin some other celebrity will come, it is not going to harm the nation any way. As a discipline,  BIG YES , Sachin should come to the House but his absence is one of the pettiest things in the country. What is really paining is:  When our own roads which we use daily are of such substandard quality where crores of rupees are eaten up by contractors and councillors and we don\u2019t have guts to ask back them (first of all we don\u2019t know who is our ward corporator is who lives in our next lane), we sit in AC rooms with internet connection and write in social media that Sachin is wasting tax payer\u2019s money and should give back the salary to public, then probably we are among the biggest hypocrites in the world . In India why do we have Rajya Sabha? Why do Indians think that Sachin Tendulkar is the god of Test cricket which isn't true? How are Rajya Sabha members elected? Cricket Players: What are some great lines said for Sachin Tendulkar? Are we allowed to attend Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha? Some times I found myself ripped off as an Indian. because when I watch that our so called politicians are using four fold policy to fulfil their interests. As we all know that president of India can nominate 12 members of Rajya Sabha according to Indian constitution. Those twelve members are recommended by Prime ministers or union ministers to fulfil their political interest i.e. Sachin or Rekha. Government used these faces as political tool. Several such stars have already accept that they couldn't survive in politics b`cause they understood that politics and their own fields are poles apart. Like that Amitabh and Dharmendra. Let Rajya Sabha be, as we talk about are MPs I have seen PM Modi has used such several faces in 2014 lok sabha election, for example Hema Malini, Paresh Rawal, Manoj Wajpeyi etc. And our loving Indians caste their votes on faces not on experience or good character. Jago Indian Jago. This is an important issue but both of them are least bothered about such a small amount. They are multi-millionare person and if they are asked to donate this amount they will immediately agree to it in the national interest but it should not be withdrawn by the government. The problem is that why such type of people are nominated by the governments, who have no time to attend the sessions. Any how next year their term would end and some other capable people would be nominated.",

So if u don't have any of the above risk and recent physical exam hasn't shown any problems, my bet is your liver is doing fine. You don't get a healthy liver, cos u already have one. If your question is how to maintain a healthy liver then my answer will be: 1. Drink less alcohol 2. Avoid long term use of medications (if possible) such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) and other unnecessary drugs. 3. Stay away from Vinyl chlorides 4. Watch what kind of mushroom to eat 5. Exercise more to prevent fatty liver Hope it answers your question. How do I get my liver healthy? Is there any food group that is good for the liver? How can I keep my liver healthy? What is the best food for liver and kidney? How can I get healthy stomach? Where can I go to get my liver panel test results \"explained\"? This is probably the hardest thing to answer. Everything we apply in our body, from the shampoo we use to the lotion we apply; from the medications or vitamins/supplements we intake daily; from the food we consume to the drinks we ingest; from the dirt and air we encounter in this life are all absorbed by the body and is filtered by the liver. So obviously we should atleast make the right choice in choosing what\u2019s safe and healthy to use and eat as there is no remedy for what you are being exposed to outside of your home. Avoiding being overweight is crucial. Many who are overweight are diagnosed with fatty liver. A condition that can progress to even cancer if not addressed with a new diet. Avoid fatty meats, cheeses, hydrogenated food, alcohol. Adding liver cleansing herbs/ supplements are helpful too. Take Milk Thistle, Dandelion, and Turmeric Supplements, You can reverse this condition without medications if you adhere to recommended diet and supplements.",

Never be so desperate for a man (or anybody else for that matter) that you forget to preserve your personal integrity. Yes, what you are describing far exceeds the warning of a gut feeling because you have direct observation of factual actions and behaviors, more than enough information/ evidence to know that this person is TOXIC beyond a shadow of a doubt. Do not mistake his openness by telling you that he has emotional problems as honesty, sincerity or vulnerability. He is telling you this so that you will feel sympathy for him, experience his behavior as common routine and then eventually accept his behavior because that is \u201cjust\u201d how he is, after all he told you, ( warned you ) and you stayed so what's the problem\u2026.right? Get out of the relationship, you will not be able to change this person and you will sacrifice all aspects of your life if you try. He told who he was, he showed you who he was, you witnessed his \u201ctrue colors\u201d\u2026 what more evidence do you need to understand that he is dangerous. Are you waiting for him to be physically violent with you before you decide what to do. You do not owe this individual any explanation, think of yourself, you are your number one priority.

The latter is a much stronger acid being responsbile for acid rain when it comes from coal burning. The gasses should be scrubbed by sulfur scavenging units before being flared. How many liters of petrol are produced from one barrel of crude oil? Crude Oil: Why is WTI oil cheaper than Brent oil? What are some of the products made from crude oil? Why is the flare burning in a refinery? Why is oil priced/traded in U.S. dollars? Some of the process streams that are routed to the flare system are corrosive. This is typically because of contaminants rather than the hydrocarbons in the system. Both hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide are commonly found in flare gas, and both of them can cause corrosion in steel piping. Probably the worst contaminant that can sometimes be found in the flare is HF. For refineries that use HF acid in their Alkylation process, an upset on that unit can put acid in the flare system. (There is a relief gas scrubber that is intended to neutralize the acid with potassium hydroxide before it leaves the unit, but it can stop working properly if the gas rates are too high or if the neutralizing solution gets spent and not replenished quickly enough.)",

        "a": "If you want to go to one, it\u2019s pretty easy: find a sponsoring organization that will let you attend, and go. You pay your money and you take your chances. There\u2019s a complex and comprehensive waiver that you sign on your way in that basically says \u201cwhatever goes wrong, it\u2019s not our fault\u201d. If you want to organize one, that\u2019s bit different. The rules vary by track owner, but in general, if it\u2019s a closed course, there\u2019s someone who will let you rent the track for a day for a fee, sometimes with other \u201crider\u201d fees (example: one track I know charges something fairly nominal for the track, but you also have to hire their rescue and fire control team, which while not punitive, is more expensive than you could do otherwise). You\u2019ll also need insurance, which is the real issue most of the time. \u201cBreaking the track\u201d - which can happen pretty easily if you wind up with a big gasoline fire on the tarmac - is a multimillion dollar disaster to repair, with the added potential to have the track owner incur further financial losses if it\u2019s not repaired quickly enough. As to \u201chow is damage prevented\u201d, the real answer is \u201ccommon sense\u201d. These track days are typically described as \u201cdriver education events\u201d. If you\u2019ve never done it before, the organizer has people - instructors - who drive you around the course, then let you drive around the course at lower speed with their help, then let you drive the course at speed with their help, then let you \u201csolo\u201d the course once they think you\u2019re up to speed. At a well run event, that keeps people from doing stupid stuff. Most of the time. At one event I attended, a guy with a brand new super expensive car decided that he was going to circle the track with a video camera on a tripod sticking out of the sunroof. No he didn\u2019t need any damn training, he knew what he was doing and you can\u2019t make me do it (rectified in the next spin of the agreement!). So he set off from pit row, entered turn one, the tripod flopped, he tried to catch it instead of driving\u2026 and endo\u2019d the car. He was OK. The car, totaled. His insurance company was not amused and decided that it was not a covered activity, particularly since he had declined \u201cinstruction\u201d at a \u201cdriver education event\u201d. I want to buy one car and employ it under Ola/Uber/fast track. Is this profitable business? Which sports car is the best for day to day use? How fast is a McLaren F1 road car around a race track? How does it fare against cars from early 2000s and post 2010 supercars? Can a regular road car be used as a track car? I am a teen, and want to drive my car fast. How can I do this, on the street and a track, and anywhere in between? Anyone who can afford a supercar can afford a track day where they aren\u2019t out there with Civics, Miatas, and Mustangs. If a car is too fast for the other cars in its experience-level run group or is too fast for its driver to control, it simply won\u2019t be allowed to participate. Generally, however, the car and its driver will go out with an instructor and then instructor will make it very clear that they\u2019re not going to be driving the car to its full potential because of the other cars in the group, but they\u2019ll still be going fast and still be learning track etiquette. Once the driver gets enough experience, running with slower cars won\u2019t be too big of an issue. They\u2019ll just know where they can pass and the other drivers in the experienced group will know to be looking out for it coming up behind them. The driver of the supercar will also likely get sick of constantly being bottled up behind slower traffic and seek out exotic car or race car track days. I have participated in a number of track days and the simple answer is rules and respect. The drivers are generally divided into groups based on experience. In the lower experience groups, passing is restricted to straight sections and sometimes even requiring the slower driver to \u201cpoint by\u201d the overtaking driver. In the higher experience groups rules are more relaxed, but overall, respect for the other drivers is required. If the rules are broken, your day is done, no recourse, no refunds.",

Okay, guy - first off, there\u2019s many \u201cinterpretations\u201d of Sharia law\u2026and very few of them even approach what ISIS does. When a person decries Sharia law because of stoning or amputation or whatever, that person is only showing how ignorant he is of Islam as it is practiced in the world today. I\u2019m quite sure that Sharia law was once strictly enforced (as it is today by a very small percentage of Muslims under ISIL, etc.), but in the overwhelming majority of the Muslim world, it\u2019s not followed anywhere nearly as strictly as before. You could compare it to the laws handed down in Deuteronomy and Leviticus, and how those were changed when Jesus walked the earth. Sharia didn\u2019t undergo a sudden change as Mosaic law did under Jesus, but it has greatly changed nonetheless. (FYI, I\u2019m Christian) Now, as to Singapore, if it were the hellhole you seem to think, then this retired Navy man should never have been able to go down to the Raffles Hotel and enjoy a Singapore Sling at the very place it was invented, much less share beers and sing karaoke with the local Singapore military that same day. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to buy bootleg software on the street just outside Clifford Pier. I\u2019ve been to Singapore several times and enjoyed myself greatly each time. Heck, once I was walking down the street laughing at the stories of guys who claimed to be mujaheddin from Afghanistan (this was back when the Soviet Union had tried to absorb Afghanistan and failed miserably). Are their punishments tougher than America\u2019s? Sure. And China\u2019s are at least as harsh. Are you going to claim that China follows Sharia law, too? So relax. Spend some time outside of the right-wing Islamophobic echo chamber, and consider that maybe, just maybe the reason why you see so much hatred on Fox News (or wherever you get your \u2018news\u2019 from) is not because Islam\u2019s \u201cat war\u201d with America, but because if they can keep your rapt attention, they can keep your viewership\u2026and your dollars. How does Sharia law in Singapore compare with the laws of China? What is the Sharia law in Singapore? Should Muslims in the U.S. be allowed to live and conduct their affairs by Sharia law and not by state or federal laws? Is it my right as a Muslim man to force my wife to wear a hijab? How does Sudan adopt Sharia law? Welp, I guess we are just going to have to burn down the all bars and set 70% of Singapore\u2019s population on fire since they be godless apostates. \u201cOi, Batman bin Suparman! Get your brothers and start rounding those infidels up! We are 50 years behind schedule!\u201d \u201cOh and start slaughtering all the pigs and dogs, filthy animals.\u201d Excuse me while I purge my male dachshund. Probably going to whip it to death just like the quoran states or something cause it has a flower in its ear like some sort of unnatural homosexual. (What you smiling at, twice damned creature?) Edit: obviously Sharia law does not work like this and is not a recognised in the courts of Singapore. But hey, if someone says it is, it must be true. Also amended the batman bin suparman name etc. Do you know that it is disgusting? The Sharia Law practiced in Singapore is about marriages and divorces and settling other personal disputes. It has a very limited function and applies to only the Muslim population who make up only 15% of Singapore\u2019s population. Sharia law has been practiced in Singapore since the 16th century. The institution was formalized under the British back in Victorian times. Since independence the minority Malay Muslim population has been afforded protection by the constitution. So why are you getting all in a tizzy about something that doesn't require any upsettedness at all? You could just google the Wikipedia article about Islam in Singapore and see that in the rest of the world where all our religions have to rub shoulders and get along that there is nothing to be afraid of. There have been countries mixing it up for hundreds of years and it's ok. They are going into the future for us to say hey look we can all live together.

So the above equation is not valid. And hence the figure asked is undefined. Thanks. Hope it helps. PS: My consideration is only in real math, if you consider complex part then as per Euler\u2019s formula we can find the answer as 1/i\u03c0 and log10/i\u03c0 (for both e and 10 respectively). Log of number less than or equal to 0 is not defined. If f(x) = log(x) Then Domain of f (I.e. values that x can take) is strictly restricted to Real numbers greater than 0. The reason is that If y=log(x) Then x = e^y Now for any real value of y, x can never be less than or equal to 0. So buddy, your question is wrong as log(-1) does not exist.",

        "a": "Let me preface this a bit by saying I\u2019m always leery of this certain kind of modern hero worship associated with popular culture nowadays. You know, the cavalcade of notifications or memorials we see in social media. As if the anointed of our culture - celebrities - get some kind of special status. They get this kind of default or obligatory public mourning, in other words. I normally don\u2019t fall into that kind of popular culture norm. If I didn\u2019t know someone, I rarely feel much of anything at the news of their passing. Life is short, we die. And celebrity status is inconsequential. Ya know? But, in Cornell\u2019s case\u2026yeah, I\u2019m actually feeling quite sad. I really liked his music. And it was part of my formative years, or various life paths. I got into this type of music in my late teens/early 20s. I blasted Soundgarden in Iraq, rolling down MSR Tampa in 2003\u20134. The earlier, heavy sound made a good soundtrack to that experience. As I got older and perhaps a bit more contemplative (but still enjoyed a heavy guitar riffing style of rock) Audioslave came around, about the time I was dealing with the effects of PTSD, although, I didn\u2019t recognize it back then. Anyway, the music resonated with me. I dug it. Played it. Really liked it. Anyway, I\u2019m sorry he was struggling with depression and felt so desperate or sad. By the way, the \u201cgrunge\u201d label was always a sort of fabrication or construct anyway. His vocals were just solid. That\u2019s all you can really say. Pitch, key\u2026spot on. Good range. Vibrato? On fucking POINT! Case in point: What was the cause of Chris Cornell's death at age 52? What does this quote from Chris Cornell mean? What are the lyrics to Chris Cornell's \"You Know My Name\"? As a tribute to Chris Cornell, what is your favorite Chris Cornell song? What was Chris Cornell like in person? I was on the bus this morning making my usual journey into work and listening to music on my music player while browsing the web on my phone. I happened to be listening to Soundgarden. While I was listening to \u201cRowing\u201d, I got a push notification from Google about the news and was shocked! I\u2019m not one to be affected by celebrity deaths but Chris is different. I grew up in a small town in India and wasn\u2019t really exposed to rock and metal music until I was about 19\u201320 years old. This was in the noughties, so, one of the bands I came across was Audioslave. Over the years, I also discovered Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog and Chris\u2019 solo stuff. He became my vocal inspiration and I wished to have an ounce of the talent he has (now, \u2018had\u2019). So, since the moment I read the news, I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it. I feel an inexplicable loss. I saw him live for the first time on his solo tour last year and I hoped to one day see Soundgarden live as well. Alas, it will never happen. Update : It's been four days now and I still can't stop thinking about it. It was really sad, heartbreaking and gutting, and I was left totally shocked and speechless by the surprising news several hours ago. Losing Chris was   very difficult for me because his work was a huge part of my teenage years, and growing up I would not have discovered music as my channel for expression outside the daily stresses of life had I never heard his soulful voice. The first tune I heard from the man was his cover of Michael Jackson\u2019s Billie Jean, which was possibly  one of the greatest covers I have heard  besides Jeff Buckley\u2019s cover of Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah - I was immediately blown away by the sheer spine-tingling emotion he expressed into those lyrics. At the same time, Soundgarden and Audioslave were some of the first hard rock and heavy metal groups I listened to, and having heard his glorious work with both groups I am always in awe with Cornell\u2019s talent as a vocalist - he was not just a powerhouse (dude had a monstrous range and retained it even until the day he died), but also a true original and a real artist who never failed to bare his soul to his listeners. RIP Sir - thank you for all the music and the memories, and forever you will always be one of my biggest inspirations in being a better vocalist and musician. Before I talk about his death and what it means to me, Chris Cornell has been my man-crush and one of my heroes since I was about 12. I\u2019m 35 now. My musical tastes have broadened considerably since I first heard \u201cOutshined\u201d on the radio growing up in east Phoenix, but his voice always takes me back to that time and place. A place where I romanticized Seattle as a sort of City Upon a Hill for the disaffected, apathetic, creative types and other nonconformists who were \u201ctoo cool for school.\u201d Seattle was pretty far (1400 miles give or take), but seemed worlds away from the drab strip malls, sun-baked streets and stucco homes of Phoenix. Seattle seemed to me back then a paragon of alternative music, art and culture nestled in the Pacific Northwest. Soundgarden and other bands from that area were my ticket to that ideal of Seattle I had in my head. As for what his death means to me? Joe Rogan\u2019s reaction in the first 15 seconds of this video pretty much sums it up: Where he made that face and mumbled \u201cfuck\u201d, that\u2019s how I felt when I woke up to the news on Thursday morning. I was in shock for a few hours, but afterward I realized something as tributes continued to stream in from all over the world. The guy touched a lot of fucking lives. A. Lot. He may have left this planet way too soon, but he left a musical legacy that will never be duplicated. That voice! That hair! Those looks! The music! So sad. But that\u2019s nowhere near the saddest part, which I am still struggling with not quite 72 hours after his passing. And that is the fact that he leaves behind a beautiful family that no longer have him there for all of life\u2019s important moments. Two teenagers and a preteen that no longer have their dad. A grieving widow that no longer has her life partner and best friend. To me, that\u2019s what\u2019s really tragic about this whole thing. Go ask Frances Bean Cobain how \u201cromantic\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d her dad\u2019s death at age 27 was. You\u2019ll probably get a punch to the face. She\u2019s said on many occasions that she\u2019d rather have her father still alive than all of that bullshit dead-rockstar mythology that surrounds him. I would feel the same way. Chris Cornell could have died 20 years ago or just flat out retired from music and his work would stand on its own merits, solidifying him as one of the all-time greats. It\u2019s the gaping hole he left in his family that will never be repaired that really hurts me. I\u2019m a human being before I\u2019m a fan, and this really sucks. Edit: I\u2019ve uploaded a podcast dedicated to Chris Cornell on Buzzsprout. I am currently trying to get a regular music podcast going and distributed in the near future. If you want to hear my tribute to him, click here: David Hunsdon's Podcast I understand there are some pops and what not, but I wanted my reaction to be raw. Thanks and hope you enjoy it.",

Since I had none of the above, I picked a few - Heraklion to Aden at 18 knots. You can provide better choices for your example in the comments, if you want. Using those unlikely elements (the 18 is very unlikely!) it would take 4.3 days to travel the 1,863 nautical miles. Is it possible to get from the Colorado to the Mississippi watershed by small boat? How long is the boat ride from Miami to Cuba? Is there any way I can go to USA from Yemen? Where can I get resources on how to build a boat? How fishes can be traced from the boat? Rough distance from Yemen to Crete is between 1500 nm (nautical miles) and 2,000 nm. A fast ship won\u2019t make it in less than 5 days to a week (Suez Canal is a big delay issue, easier for commercial vessels than private vessels, and I used an average speed of 20 knots - faster than I think it could be accomplished). Hint: Google Earth has a \u201cruler\u201d app that makes it easy to calculate rough distances between points on the map. Find the distance in whatever units of measurement you choose, divide by the fastest speed possible via your chosen means of travel to get a rough (very rough) approximation of travel time. It\u2019s super easy and takes less time than submitting the question to Quora. Nope as there are not that many boats that will do apx 166.6 mph for 12 hrs in any conditions and then levitate the Suez Canal .Sorry.",

        "a": "I own both, I'm partial to iPhone, but this is a hard question to answer because there are good points to both systems. Here, I'll try to point out the good on both and see where this goes. PRO ANDROID: 1.  The eco system is more open.  For instance, Swype told me that Apple won't let them ship its very cool keyboard replacement for iPhone.  2.  Maps are better.  Google Maps is way better on Android than it is on iPhone. Why? It has better graphics, better integration with Google Buzz, turn-by-turn navigation, etc. 3.  Google voice integration is better on Android. 4.  Choice of handsets is better on Android . On iPhone you only have one choice and if you don't like it for some reason you are screwed. 5.  Choice of carriers  (used to be a bigger deal when iPhone was only on AT&T, but now it's on Verizon too. That said, with Android you have choice of Sprint and TMobile, too). 6.  Price . Generally Android-based phones are lower cost than iPhones. 7.  Voice response . Talking to your phone generally is better on an Android device. 8.  Integration of Google's services . Generally I like how Gmail, Google Calendar, et al, works on Android vs. iPhone. 9.  More customizable.  With lots of widgets for home screens, and different keyboard choices, Androids are more customizable. That said, I get Apple's point, too, that this makes iPhone generally more usable. PRO IPHONE 1.  Apps are overall better quality . They do more, crash less, and are generally more mature. 2.  There are more apps . Not as big a deal as it once was, but many businesses are still supporting only iOS. 3.  I like the usability overall better . This is subjective, but I still don't like Android's usability overall as much. It feels clunky compared to iOS and just isn't as smooth to scroll around, or use and things just seem better thought out on iOS. I know lots of people who feel the opposite, though, so your milage may vary. 4.  Integration with other Apple devices  (my iPhone runs my Apple TV, for instance). 5.  More third-party accessories . Generally iPhone, because of its standard connector, has a much better third-party accessory market, including being built into many new cars. 6.  Stores offer more help . Compare the experience of walking into an Apple store and getting help vs. walking into an AT&T or Verizon one (I'm usually told to sign into the store at AT&T and wait my turn, just one small example of how the Apple stores do it better). 7.  More bleeding edge apps . The photo above is of Otavio Good, author of Word Lens, that translates Spanish to English and vice versa. His app, and many other \"bleeding edge\" examples are only available on iOS. 8.  Hardware feels better in my hands . I have many of the latest Android devices too, including the Galaxy S, but it just doesn't feel as nicely designed. Again, this one is subjective and I'm sure there are folks who will argue the other point. 9.  Only developers care, but the tools and consistency of iOS platform makes it easier to develop on . They also tell me it's easier to monetize apps on the iOS platform. They tell me that they need to do a lot more testing of various devices on Android platform and that that platform has fragmented quite a bit. Which is why we still see better apps on iOS. 10.  No bloatware . My Samsung Galaxy S came with 52 icons. The iPhone has a fraction of that many. For me, though, I'm still an iPhone fan. I'll be at the Google IO conference, though, and will see if I get switched over there. UPDATE: to back up my claims of more developers/apps on iOS, here's results of a new study just reported in Techcrunch:  http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/16... Do you like iOS or Android operating system? Why does everyone prefer using iOS rather than Android? What about a Windows phone? Why is Android better than iOS for developers? Why is it so that Android phones are cheaper as compared with other operating system phones like Windows or iOS? How secure is Android as an operating system compared to iOS? There are tons of ways to describe both platforms; iOS & Android. (and many more to compare & describe them) Since both these platforms occupy a majority of the market share in the smartphone & tablet category, it's worth well asking, which one happens to be the best? To begin with, I personally believe (as will many others) iOS is much better overall.  To explain in simple terms... What iOS means to: General day to day users: Simplest to use among all OS. The App Store is home to more than 9,00,000 apps (3,50,000 iPad specific only) & most of them still happen to hit the App Store first. (It even has a category as 'iOS originals') http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10... Security (which is of great concern these days, since most of us carry highly important data & documents on our phones), has been iOS's forte. It's strong, robust & less susceptible to attacks as compared to the other platforms. Recently the US forces dumped blackberry devices in favor of Apple iPhones & iPads (partly for price issues & for security) Users are happy spending (since the apps provide a rich & immersive experience, be it games that rival console level graphics or apps that help you get organized) Everyone gets integrated in the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 apple ecosystem. (and this is difficult to let go once you use an apple device) Apple devices generally have a\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 longer life (approx. 3 years, since the iOS updates are supported for older devices as well. iPhone 4 still supports iOS 7, although it lags a bit now) Android is way too fragmented as compared to iOS and it's updates largely depend on manufacturers & phone hardware. (chances are majority android users are stuck on their stock versions of OS for most of their time) http://bgr.com/2013/12/13/androi... And perhaps the best part, users get the strong reliability of apple service. iOS experience on iPad as well as iPhone (or iPod touch) remains largely the same). Hence transition or upgrading to a newer device is simple. For developers: iOS SDKs are found to be much more simple to use & implement. Since apple uses seamless integration between its software and hardware, iOS apps are more fluid & responsive. Apple has strict policies to which every developer (ie; the apps) must comply with. (Else it results in ousting of the app from the store). This has two fold effect : the apps that are on the App Store are genuinely good & have less flaws. Next, it helps the developer to achieve good levels of security, fit & finish of their apps(thus making them better developers) Monetization from the App Store is much more as compared to the google play store. (Apple claims to have paid the app developers around 10 Billion USD) https://www.apple.com/pr/library... Since there are not too many screen sizes & resolutions that apple devices use, it's much more easy for an app to be compatible with various devices. (Android versions of certain apps seem 'blown out' in tablet versions) Apple has total control over the app ecosystem. (Take iOS 7 for example, within few months of its official rollout, most of the apps are now compatible with iOS 7 & feature a clean , simple & minimalistic UI that feels right at home on iOS 7 and the adoption rate for iOS 7 is around 80%) The drawback; apple devices running iOS come at a premium price. This turns down most consumers. It isn't as customizable as android. For further detailed explanations & statistics you can refer the following links. http://www.diffen.com/difference... http://techland.time.com/2014/02... Note: I have been an android user for 3 years (even tried & used 'rooted' phone for a year). Currently I m enjoying my experience as an iPhone 5 owner. All the above suggestions are personal & opinions can vary individually. Disclaimer: When I speak about Android, I'm talking about  stock Android, i.e the Android that  Google  builds,  not Samsung/LG/HTC's interpretation. There is no clear cut answer as to which OS is better. A lot of factors come into play--your own taste and needs are very important here. In general, Android offers a much more versatile, customizable experience. Homescreens are virtually infinitely customizable, and any task you can think of can be automated via Tasker (which, arguably, unlocks the true power of Android). Flawless and deep integration with Google is another plus (no pun intended!), and this element of Android is indispensable for those that rely on Google for their email/calendar/navigation needs. Android is what enables you to have dual-screen phones like the YotaPhone 2; its principles are \"freedom\" based. iOS, on the other hand, still resonantes with UX elegance. Apps are almost always better optimized for iOS (the fact that developers seem to prefer iOS is a major determinant of this fact), and the \"occasional lag/hiccup\" associated with Android is almost non-existent in iOS. That being said, the philosophy of iOS is, in some ways, the exact opposite of Android's. You can't download a random file off the internet and use your file explorer to open it, for instance (notwithstanding jailbraking). There are no fancy widgets on your home screen, and even installing a custom ringtone requires a bit of work. Even still, if you are invested in Apple's ecosystem, the integration is great. Handoffs, for example, is brilliant in real world use. The iPhone 6+ has a great battery life, and, in comparison to Android phones, it's almost shocking that iOS runs (currently) on just 1GB of RAM (and by \"runs,\" I mean that it flies. Most of the time). There are pros and cons--no real answer. The iPhone was crowned the phone with the best camera for a while, but the S6 and G4 have seriously threatened that position.  It all depends on what you're looking for. I'm currently on Android and will never look back, most likely. Both the operating systems are great with respect to their device supportability and features. Good things about iOS are: It is designed for Apple devices which are having stronger CPU and GPU for processing or graphical needs. It is designed to keep the application layer nearer to physical layer of the operating system, which imparts incredible performance and lesser deadlocks. Apple regularly provides updates with improvements and stability fixes all together for all devices. Apple iPhones have great customer support which makes people opting for Apple devices. Whereas for Google\u2019s Android: Its a most generic and advanced mobile operating system build to run on any device from any vendor. Supports any processor or chipset. It has more intelligent os structure than iOS as the device screen size and configuration are not fixed in phone supporting Android. Google\u2019s android has changed its run time and has significantly brought application layer nearer to physical layer of operating system. Those vendors providing pure android are having best device performance and huge stability than customized Android os. Customer support depends on vendors and that's why people prefer android less over iOS. Hope this answers your question.",

        "a": "In my experience, yes. You can\u2019t come out and say straight away you don\u2019t believe in a God. But I know a lot of atheists, and they are not ostracized by their communities. Maybe people try to show them the path, but that\u2019s about it. What happens is a lot of people have different versions of what a religious Muslim means. Someone would essentially avoid pork and drinking but would smoke and indulge in a lot of non Islamic behavior, and would gain acceptance as frankly a lost kid. Others would wear Hijab, but tend to lie and be prone to hypocrisy or gossip, which is banned in Quran. Others think a non-hijabi girl like me is an outcast and cannot be called a Muslim, or someone who does not follow Hadiths but is a Quranist cannot be called a Muslim, basically a lot of old pagan practices that are culturally held under the Islamic culture have got conflated with religiosity. Hijab was a pagan innovation, Prophet Muhammad for the most period of his life was an agnostic, Khadeeja was a queen, head of tribe and a businesswoman who frankly paid for the revolution that is the Islamic empire. These are hadiths that are authenticated, but for some reason I would have to change the definition of a Muslim woman from someone who is covered from head to toe to someone who fasts, prays, practices charity, believes in God and the hereafter and goes for pilgrimage, which is the standard definition for someone considered a Muslim. What happens in the end is , in order to be not oppressed by the cultural ethics of how a person should be, many Muslim women, just to work and to exist freely, adopt the agnostic or atheist title, so that society would leave them alone, when frankly they live their lives according to Quran\u2019s standard. Quite a lot of atheist Muslim women I follow and otherwise, frankly still culturally follow their religion\u2019s ethics and avoid it\u2019s major sins, but do not want society to decide how she should behave. I refuse to let that happen to me. Humanity tends to distort religion to fit it\u2019s own nature. You can always find an argument that supports your own confirmation bias towards how a religious society should be. I will add more details and factual info-graphics later. Do Muslims condemn the killing of gays in some Muslim majority countries? Will India end up having a Muslim majority in the future? What will be the social, economical and political consequences if that happens? What are the most liberal Muslim majority countries? How many countries are Muslim-Majority? Why aren't most Muslim countries secular? How do Muslims in secular countries feel about this situation? Atheistophobic? Not sure if it's a  real  word, but maybe if you refer 'a condition when a few religious person - especially Muslims - see atheists as an object  of fear',  probably. It may be a word. I've seen and know many Muslims that wanted me to believe Islam, even coerce it. Physical abuse? Meh. Lots of it, but still,  I'm ended up writing my status as an atheist. From the way they try to imply their belief to me, it seems that they really are afraid of godless persons. I mean, they're cool with Christians, Hinduists, or Buddhists, but aren't with atheists. They say it  themselves.  They consider godless persons are immoral, lacking source of moral compass. They even say some of people who wage wars are godless. Not sure why, but  do they miss Character Building class which is applicable to everybody? Yes, they fear that atheism will rise, maybe until a point that they're frightened and fainted by looking at an atheist's face, and it's an urban secret. Some of them know there are atheists, but they let them live their life to dispatch problems that may occur when they na\u00efvely reveal their atheism. Here,  just pretend you are religious. Just because Muslim countries are phobic of anything other than themselves. That includes even muslim sects which are from minority. So, yes atheists are persecuted killed jaild in muslim countries let alone speak their minds like in other countries. Muslims are so behind the rest of the world. Yes I'm putting this bluntly - and short - since I'm writing from my phone with very little power left. Yes, they are. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are both brilliant examples of this, but places like Qatar and Bangladesh shouldn't be left out either. The abovementioned nations, and others, fear the spread of \u201cunbelief\u201d in their populates, and respond to atheism and apostasy with variety of punishments, most commonly imprisonment, decapitation or - in the case of Saudi Arabia - crucifixion. Well I am muslim and I lived in an islamic majority country for all my life, the percentage of atheists are very small here but it is somehow growing, my country has very bad education system so most of people are ignorant so everything that they don\u2019t know seem a little bit dangerous, so yea most of the people are atheistophobic, but for educated people how get to meet atheists as one of their friends or member of their family, they get to know that they are normal people with different thoughts which is completely not dangerous.",

        "a": "When it became clear that most of republics (*) wanted to preserve the USSR  Soviet Union referendum 1991 , those who\u2019d benefit from replacing the heavyweight superpower for small independent nations designed and implemented a very complex plot to break the Union. The  1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt  was only to top of the iceberg, and no one has yet definitely answered the question if the  State Committee on the State of Emergency  was in fact designed by Gorbachev to set up Yeltsin, by orthodox Communists to support Gorbachev against Yeltsin, or by Yeltsin\u2019s covert supporters in order to discredit Gorbachev completely and immediately vest extraordinary powers to Yeltsin. Whatever it was stirred up protests and civil unrest both centrally and regionally. Nationalism, separatism and historic guilt were added as secret ingredients to the boiling mass. Violence erupted in Moscow, Leningrad, Samara, Sverdlovsk and other large cities in Russia, violent separatism rolled through Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Middle Asia. In this context, republics were considering secession \u201cin order to prevent violence to spill over from Russia, torn by civil disobedience\u201d, and Ukraine was the first to conduct her own plebiscite to counter the 4-month old results of the All-Union referendum of March 1991. Yet three months later (just after all republics had a chance to feel some radical violence, which the Soviet authorities failed to prevent or stop even in spite of occasionally using the army), Yeltsin called the leaders of Ukraine, Belorussia and Kazakhstan to Belovezha (close to the Polish border, so that there would be a handicap should the KGB come to arrest them as plotters) to sign the  Belavezha Accords . In fact, they gathered together in order to sign some minor economic documents, but the meeting ended up big. In spite of the absence of the leader of Kazakhstan, who went to Gorbachev instead (so, Gorbachev was aware of the plot but chose not to retreat to repressive action), the accords were signed. The first person the three men called to tell the news was George Bush. With his support and approval, they made the second telephone call, this time to Gorbachev. In spite of the will of the people in 10 republics, the troika dissolved the government of the USSR (as the president of Russia, Yeltsin simply shut down all USSR offices in Moscow). The USSR stopped to exist, and other republics soon had no choice but to join the Accords. Why were the results of the 1991 referendum ignored? It was because a bunch of people, raised and bred within the communist system, had no respect the will of their people. They switched alliances to serve the interests of foreign powers, and used their insight to kick the people in their very soft groin. (*) Excluding the Baltics, which had already been stirred up to the extent of rebellion by the publication and heated discussion of the fake \u201csecret protocol\u201d to the Pact of Molotov-Ribbentrop, Georgia and Armenia, where local nationalists promoted immediate secession. The five republics effectively claimed their sovereignty even before the 1991 referendum, that is, before asking the people.",

But if I understand right, Petr is right. Team Viewer is not spyware. It\u2019s a tech support tool, like Remote Desktop. It\u2019s supposed to let your tech take control of your computer so he can fix it without actually being there. Many services will ask to install programs like this for that purpose. The thing to remember about it is that no one should be able to take control of your computer without your permission. You have to agree to it in every instance, and once it\u2019s over the connection shuts down. They  can\u2019t  be connected to every computer in the school with it at all times anyway. Remote connections require huge bandwidth. Wifi traffic would crawl to a stop. Forget remote desktop then. If normal traffic is jammed, there is no way a remote connection will work. My guess is your school is wary of malicious attacks that can happen when you let someone else take remote control like that, so they prefer to handle tech support themselves. It keeps your computer from infecting others in the school which could, after all, be networked to each other through the wifi. What's the best laptop I can buy as a CS student? I will study Computer Science in college but I can't afford to buy a laptop. Is it possible just to use computers in the school for studying? School Laptop and what should I do? Do you really need a laptop for high school? The school I'll be attending this fall is giving new Mac laptop computers to its new students. I'm used to using Windows. How hard is it using... I\u2019ve worked for a financial company and I can tell you, the company knows every website/keystroke/mouse click you make. I see no reason schools don\u2019t do it too. Whenever I use some other companies computer for my IT work, I forever assume someone knows what I do, where I go, and I have to assume they know what passwords I\u2019ve entered (so I don\u2019t do it too often, just when the job requires it). Knowing that others will be aware of what I\u2019m doing, keeps me honest and never attempting to circumvent them. For they\u2019ll see that too, no matter how clever I think I am. So I don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s the easiest way to lose my job. Sometimes, paranoia can be a GOOD thing. The short answer is yes, A network admin should be able to deduce what you are doing. The WiFi router will show an active connection but he will also know that Windows and Team Viewer are not running on the same address. When you connect to Tor there will also be an active connection through his internet gateway. Again he can see the address. The session is encrypted so he won't see precisely where you are connecting, but he will see the first hop. He also knows which machines are still running Windows and Team Viewer so he can narrow down his search if he wants to find you. It is quite possible that he could. But not because of Teamviewer. It would be because of the specific network activity that Tor uses. When you boot into Tails and connect it to a network, it establishes an encrypted connection to the Tor network to allow for private browsing. Even though the specific data that you are sending and receiving is hidden, the connection itself is not. If their firewall is set up to filter specific types of traffic, you may not be able to connect at all. On many of the networks I\u2019ve worked on there was a threat detection and mitigation system in place. These would monitor all network traffic for anything that was not allowed or just suspicious. From basic website blocking to looking for specific activity like torrenting or streaming. These systems could also detect a connection to Tor. If they got an alert that someone was using Tor via WiFi, it would be pretty easy to see which access point you were connected to and then look around there for someone not using Windows.",

Trump is his own worst enemy. If he stayed away from Twitter, stuck to the script, and no longer did interviews, then he would be much more difficult to show the err of his ways. He talks big, but has failed to deliver on most (all?) of his campaign and presidential promises. It\u2019s hard to argue against recordings and Tweets, that he did himself. Who is Donald Trump's base? Why is he popular? Why are people voting for him? Why do people like and support him? Why do some people hate Donald Trump and others like him? Why do some people dislike Donald Trump? What do you hate that everyone else loves? Why is the Quora community so anti-Donald Trump? He plays the media constantly and consistently. He seemingly has a good grasp of the industry and plays them endlessly to achieve his goals. And he keeps winning the battles. Not to mention, they keep looking like fools. He bought a $3B presidential campaign for $100M, including $25M in court settlements. The media provided it and made big money by doing so. He won. Most shocking result this century surely. And the virtual reality show plays on TV and social networks non-stop, with Trump the center of attention. The media has been going through psychoanalytic overhauls periodically. \u201cStop getting sucked into \u2026\u201d He uses context manipulation to attain his ends. They don't know what that is. It just keeps looking like \u201che tweeted this horrible thing\u201d, then this happened and that happened, and he achieved his end, and that was really terrible what he said \u2026 \u201d Ad nauseum. Meanwhile, sub rosa, he threatens the establishment about once a week. There's an entire conversation going on that is missed by the uninformed. What is missing, glaringly, is media response to or analysis of any of his provocations. It may be mentioned once; they detect the trap; never to be mentioned again. Congress so far has submitted to his demands. They repealed the Sequester last month. Miss that? That freed up the \u201ctargeted tax subsidies\u201d slated for elimination on his one-page tax reform plan. Surely the establishment Senate (39 Rs, 13 Ds) didn't miss the defense increases granted through EOY 2017 effected that result. If you assume you're way ahead of him, he'll prove that. If you assume he's way ahead of all of them, you'll get a much clearer picture of what's actually going on. In the attached, Scott Adam\u2019s #5 Pacing and Leading is the only discussion of the topic that I've seen that provides a picture of what's going on.  Scott Adams' Blog Simply put the media hates liars, regardless of party. Trump is a special breed of liar and the media, rightfully so in my opinion is going to go after him with everything they have. If they can bring him down so much the better for our country. I am a registered Republican, have been for the last thirty years. Trump doesn't have my values, not even close, so he didn't win my vote. (Grabbing Pussy, really.) I looked at the opruins and voted for the better, more expirence candidate and that was Hilary Clinton. If the media is able to show and congress is able to prove that Trump was in bed with the Russians he should be shot for treason. I'm not kidding I truly believe if the media can show us that he committed treason and he is found guilty of the same by congress he should be shot on Pennsylvania Avenue for playing fast and loose with our democracy. The media is looking out for our democrac as they always have. People always have slammed the media when it didn't report things as they would have wanted them to be reported, but up until recently facts and truth meant a lot to journalists and that is what they reported. Now anyone with a keyboard claims to be a journalist which has caused confusion and havoc among our citizens. The media loves Trump because he is instant ratings. The media loathes Trump for his policies against immigrants. His use of fear and hatred to ignite his base which also forced American to look at the uglier side of itself. In a strange way, I think Trump has been good for the country. It is forcing ourselves to look at our flaws and there are lot of them. Sadly, there is also a large % of the population who like his \u201cflaws\u201d and want to continue to cover it up with the false bravado that Trump embraces. Hate? For the most part, the media is reporting what\u2019s going on. And what happens to be going on right now is a lot of behind-the-scenes turmoil at the Trump White House. Do reporters and media outlets get more excited about/put more resources into a juicy, controversial story than \u201cTrump unveils plan for national parks system overhaul\u201d? Sure.

        "a": "I have a horrendous case of OCD, so I have been forced to read very extensively all articles(publications) I could find and verse myself as much as I can in genetics and about neurotransmitters, and generally in neurology, neurophysiology, neuropsychology and psychophysiology. Why is it claimed that THC is psychoactive and CBD isn\u2019t psychoactive. I have found out that THC rich cannabis has great effects for me personally, so I have been smoking it in low quantities for some years just to alleviate the symptoms for a short time. But OCD is simply something that makes a person\u2019s life unbearable so I decided to ignore all the negative (and many unproven) claims about cannabis and after a period of about 10-12 months (divided in periods of two months with pauses again of two months imposed by professional engagements) of heavy smoking THC rich cannabis I really feel a huge improvement and I can say more than half way (even almost complete) healing effect. I have also tried Cannabis Indica, the cannabis strain rich in CBD and not much in THC. The effects from it were a lot lesser and required a lot higher quantities. Recently I learned about and tried CBD oil in the recommended doses and didn\u2019t feel any effect from that. So you can imagine the disappointment (or rather you can\u2019t imagine it if you don\u2019t have OCD yourself) that I felt that the only legal thing I have found so far which could potentially help me had no effect. Then eventually as a final attempt I decided to drink half of a bottle of high CBD content oil mixed with some water and the effect I felt was great. Similar to smoking one to three cannabis cigarettes at once, but lasting a lot longer \u2013 one to two days. So the following question really began to bother me - why is it claimed that THC is psychoactive and CBD isn\u2019t. The first stimulates the release of serotonin (yes THC DOES stimulate release of serotonin and there are publications showing that) and the second causes activation of serotonin receptors (mainly 5-HT1A). These are both psychoactive effects and from my experience exactly the so called psychoactive effect is what actually helped me immensely. So what is the source of that claim. I\u2019m beginning to think the only potential reason could be the a lot higher price of CBD oil than ordinary cannabis and CBD according to my experience has to be applied in higher doses to have a considerable effect. Steven Cooper  The details to my question are in the comment. CBD doesn\u2019t have different compounds in it. It is a single compound (molecule) by itself. Mainly my question is why it\u2019s claimed CBD isn\u2019t psychoactive. What is the difference between releasing serotonin and activating serotonin receptors. Regulation of 5-HT (serotonin); and 5-HT receptors and transporter genes expression is the mechanism for treating OCD. These are both psychoactive effects and exactly these effects are what I think helped me personally (in my experience CBD can have even better effects than THC when taken in high doses). I did have an absolutely horrible case of OCD, but after deciding on my own to try cannabis in high doses I can say the OCD symptoms have dissipated almost entirely. Only if I stop using it gradually I still begin to experience the effects of low serotonin levels, which basically prevent me from using my brain to its full capacity, which was the main biological cause for developing OCD in the first place. And when my brain became able to work at full capacity it was able to \u2018reprogram\u2019 (strengthen and loosen the appropriate neuronal connections, create new ones and so on) itself and basically treat itself. Only CBD oil has to be taken in much higher doses than THC to achieve the same effect, at least in my case. I\u2019m not from the United States so I can\u2019t speak about why it\u2019s illegal there. I also can\u2019t speak about why it\u2019s illegal in my country and many other countries ))) Alcohol for example is also psychoactive and certainly doesn\u2019t have any medicinal value, but it\u2019s legal almost everywhere. And why should the fact that something has psychoactive effects make it be considered illegal anyway if it doesn\u2019t have any detrimental psychological or physical effects (or even if it does have such effects). Again alcohol and tobacco have terrible physical and psychological effects but they are both legal. I\u2019m beginning to form a personal speculation that most probably its quite very well known by some people that cannabis can potentially have very wide range of medical applications and some drug companies with high lobbying power wouldn\u2019t like people to be able to grow their own medicines in their backyards. This sounds like a wild speculation to me, but I\u2019m really struggling to find a logical explanation why cannabis would be illegal and even put in the same category as other substances. Maybe that\u2019s why also only CBD is considered semi-legal in the US, so people are still forced to buy rather expensive CBD oils. OCD was so extreme and brutal in my case and I imagine for other people with bad cases too, so I\u2019d say the fact that cannabis is illegal amounts to a human rights violation since it obviously is very effective against the disorder. Whether studies, researching its healing effect exist or don\u2019t (they do) and whether they are performed with a non-biased method, the fact is that A LOT of people report positive effect for many kinds of illnesses after using cannabis, so that simply implies that scientists should try harder to understand its workings. Biology and chemistry are hardly my favorite fields, but I have read very many articles from the National Institute for Mental Health, National Institute for Biotechnology Information and many other publications to try to find if there are any clues to the underlying reasons for OCD. And indeed there are quite a lot of clues. But unfortunately I have to say many of these articles seem written in a very biased way toward one or another hypotheses or drugs. And that is indicative of a very sad state of affairs in the medical science. It basically shows an abandonment of the pure scientific method. Anyway after discovering CBD oil and its very useful \u2018psychoactive\u2019 effects for me when applied in high doses I began to acquire as much of it as I can carry from the US, or have people send it to me so I can use it as a substitute for THC. I\u2019m also thinking to start combining cannabis and CBD oil with the hope that maybe sooner or later that will have an enough epigenetic effect on me to downregulate my SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter) gene and regulate other serotonin related genes to an acceptable level of expression. How hard is it to treat OCD? Can OCD be treated using medical marijuana? Where can I buy cannabis oil? How do I treat my OCD? What is OCD and how to treat it? Because it is not psychoactive. The psychoactive component of marijuana is  Tetrahydrocannabinol - Wikipedia  or THC. CBD is  Cannabidiol - Wikipedia  and is not psychoactive. It has anti-inflammatory properties which make it of interest in medicine. It also appears to have anti-anxiety and anti-convulsive properties and is frequently used as an alternative treatment in childhood epilepsy. Much more study is required to ascertain the exact pharmaceutical benefits but laws involving marijuana makes such research difficult. It\u2019s true that CBD does not have psychoactive compounds in it. None. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so stupid of the government to have it classified as a Schedule I drug. They only classify it that way to \u201cprove\u201d that there are no \u201cmedical benefits\u201d with cannabis. I checked and there have been studies on treating OCD with CBDs. One link takes you to an article about it\u2026  Treating OCD With CBD: The Facts - Healthy Report . I don\u2019t believe the mechanism is known - how the CBD works in the brain to produce the desired effect. The article says CBD\u2019s are legal in all states\u2026 the article is WRONG!\u2026 the DEA(th) has another take on the subject\u2026 because it\u2019s made from the cannabis plant, the DEA has it scheduled in the first class\u2026 \u2018highly addictive\u2019 \u2018no medical benefits\u2019\u2026 in that case, why does the US Government have a US Patent on cannabinoids as neuroprotectors? Studies have shown cannabis can help treat TBI (traumatic brain injuries) and as a treatment for being exposed to nerve agents. Here\u2019s a link about the legality of CBDs.

Starkiller Base has to be doing quite a lot better than that to hit five at once. So here\u2019s the rub.  Star Wars  isn\u2019t especially trying to be science fiction. It\u2019s a fantasy story set in space. There is an acknowledgment of technology, but nothing about the way it\u2019s used makes sense. For instance, you could argue that the First Order and the Galactic Empire are both Type II civilizations based on their capacity for energy output. But then, how come AT-ATs can be undone with a cable wrapping around their legs? How come blaster bolts travel so slow and don\u2019t disintegrate anything? Why are human beings still operating and aiming turrets manually when the real-life military hardly does that anymore? It gets even weirder when you see bipedal droid soldiers operating them, as opposed to, you know, just having the droid brain onboard the turret itself. If they\u2019re so efficient at generating energy, how come they don\u2019t have matter synthesizers? If hyperdrives can cross the entire Galaxy in a day or two, how can there possibly be any resource shortages, let alone a need for currency in the form of galactic credits? You can pick apart the design and function of endless pieces of  Star Wars  technology, which is often wildly anachronistic and mostly inspired by World War I and World War II. The  Star Wars  universe isn\u2019t  without  logic, mind you; as a fantasy world specially made for a feature film series it simply has its own logic, designed more so to externalize the conflicts between the characters in an interesting way than to serve any kind of scientific analysis. Star Wars Episode VII: How did the First Order arise and how does it earn money? How advanced is the Star Wars Galactic Empire according to the Kardashev scale?

The First Order does both and uses the star to vaporize entire planets that were controlled by the Republic (if I\u2019m correct). So yes, they are a type II civilization.",

        "a": "In  Hinduism ,  dharma  signifies behaviours that are considered to be in accord with  rta , the order that makes life and universe possible,and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and \u2018\u2018right way of living\u2019\u2019. In  vedas  , Dharma is defined as your duties for a better society , anything that help people, improve your living quality . It is anything that is applicable to all people. If it is not hurting any person,it is Dharma If you are helping people ,it is Dharma If you are improving your life It is Dharma . How will I know that whatever action I am doing is in the path of Dharma? How is Atheism supported in San\u0101tana Dharma? Do you know what is the importance of Dharma in our life? How do I follow path of dharma? Which is the best website to know about real Vedic or the Sanatana Dharma? Basic of hindu dharma The 10 Rules of Dharma  Manusmriti   written by the ancient sage Manu, prescribes 10 essential rules for the observance of dharma: Patience (  dhriti  ), forgiveness (  kshama  ), piety or self control (  dama  ), honesty (  asteya  ), sanctity (  shauch  ), control of senses (  indraiya-nigrah ), reason (  dhi  ), knowledge or learning (  vidya  ), truthfulness (  satya  ) and absence of anger (  krodha  ). Manu further writes, \"Non-violence, truth, non-coveting, purity of body and mind, control of senses are the essence of dharma\". Therefore dharmic laws govern not only the individual but all in society. I have been to vipassana retreats. So I heard a story, in which an old Lady goes to Buddha and asks what dharma is. But there is a condition put forth. The definition of dharma should be in as little words as possible. Buddha accepted this, he knew that the woman has seen many sages in her lifetime and was confused because every definition seem different to her. According to Buddha dharma is something that is very easy to understand. Buddha says, Staying away from all kinds of had deeds. Doing all kinds of skillful deeds. Purifying your mind completely This is the teaching of all the Buddha's. Apart from this there are six qualities of dhamma. The Six qualities of the Dhamma : 1.  Svakkhato : The Dhamma is not a speculative philosophy, but is the Universal Law found through enlightenment and is preached precisely. Therefore it is Excellent in the beginning (Sila \u2014 Moral principles), Excellent in the middle (Samadhi \u2014 Concentration) and Excellent in the end (Panna \u2014 Wisdom), 2.  Samditthiko : The Dhamma is testable by practice and known by direct experience, 3.  Akaliko : The Dhamma is able to bestow timeless and immediate results here and now, for which there is no need to wait until the future or next existence. 4.  Ehipassiko : The Dhamma welcomes all beings to put it to the test and to experience it for themselves. 5.  Opaneyiko : The Dhamma is capable of being entered upon and therefore it is worthy to be followed as a part of one's life. 6.  Paccattam veditabbo vinnunhi : The Dhamma may be perfectly realized only by the noble disciples who have matured and enlightened enough in supreme wisdom. 6 qualities of the Dhamma And while practicing the Dhamma, Buddha has compared the qualities of Dhamma with the 8 qualities of ocean. Uposatha Sutta: Uposatha when you keep this in mind you immediately know the right way to understand and practice religion/dharma or dhamma. May you become filled with knowledge, wisdom and peace. Simple. Hinduism is just like any other religion. It has orthodox rules like other religions. Dharma is derived from Vedas. Your dharmas are: Do  not , under any circumstance, masturbate. Do  not  look at any women sexually. If you do, repent like hell. Complete your degree and get a decent job. Do  not  go after money and all that. Just earn so much to cover your necessities. Forget about yourself . Don\u2019t take much care about yourself. Always think about others (Hinduism is collectivistic). Take care of your mom and dad like they are gods. Forget about your ambition  to achieve great heights. Anything materialistic is strictly forbidden by Hinduism - good food, good clothing, cosmetics, sexuality, etc. Your mind should always be towards reaching something called \u2018 moksha \u2019. Otherwise you will be considered an a-hole. Help others . From the salary you get, spend on your parents and spend the rest on poor and needy people. Do not fall in love . If you do, do  not  do any kind of romance. Marry immediately. In Hinduism, marriage is just a \u2018 duty \u2019 and creating babies. If you marry,  do not indulge in sex much . As per Hinduism, your wife should be necessarily a  housewife with no sexual desire , cooking and looking after your parents. If you have sex, do not enjoy it. Think of it of an act for making a baby, nothing else. Ignore and hate  western, modern and liberal people. When you grow old (about sixty years or something), go to the forest and meditate for moksha, leaving your household. So, these are the  necessary Ethics of Hinduism . Refer to  Vedas, Puranas and Bhagavad Gita  for further reading. Note: What? You thought Hinduism is a liberal philosophy which lets you do whatever you want? Sorry dude, you were wrong. Anything you do that makes your consciousness prick is adharma. You will genuinely know if something is wrong, hold on to that.",

There is British English but not a  ( singular )  British Accent British English is a spoken and a written language used in the UK. Whilst most of us also include some local dialect words, we can contrast it to American, or Australian or Indian English by its use of words particular to the British (fortnight for 14 days) and by particular accepted spellings (colour not color). You can talk British English, and even the most formal variety of British English called Standard British English (which includes no dialect words or regional grammatical contstructions) irrespective of your British accent. Inside the UK, your British accent would be identified as Northern English, Scottish or Welsh etc, or maybe within that as Scourse, or Edinburgh, or Cardiff. We do not recognise one single variety as being  the  \u2018British Accent\u2019. A southern English accent called RP One of the accents in the Middle/ South East of England has the peculiar name of \u2018Received Pronounciation\u2019. It is based on the accent of the Southern Midlands (think Oxford to Cambridge). Over generations it was picked up both by students who studied there but also by the pupils in Britain\u2019s famous boarding schools. These schools draw in children from across the country, and with no regional accent in common, the students picked up the accent of their Oxbridge educated teachers. As these students and school pupils grew up to become the British establishment, the accent acquired lots of baggage, for both good and ill. RP is not a localised accent Well it is of course if you come from the South Midlands as it's one of the accents predominant around here\u2026 But it's popularity beyond its original location stemmed from people acquiring the accent during their studies. It is therefore an accent shared by a tribe of  no fixed abode . However few RP speakers today \u2018acquired\u2019 their accent this way - most will have spoken RP naturally from birth as it is the accent which is predominant amongst their parent\u2019s social group, the children of that group and also their school mates if they attend a private school in the South Midlands or South East [It IS bad therefore to call this accent fake as it offends people - do not call people pretentious / posh for their accent any more than you would call a Scouser common for their accent. No-one should judge either way !] There is not just one RP Like any true British accent, you can sub-divide it down into ever smaller categories\u2026. From the BBC\u2019s Listening Project : \u201cConservative RP refers to a very traditional variety associated with older speakers and the aristocracy.  Mainstream RP describes an accent that we might consider extremely neutral in terms of signals regarding age, occupation or lifestyle of the speaker .  Contemporary RP refers to speakers using features typical of younger RP speakers. All, however, are united by the fact they do not use any pronunciation patterns that allow us to make assumptions about where they are from in the UK.\u201d Why overseas people think RP is \u2018the\u2019 British Accent Well, as in bold italics above, it is an accent which tried to give no clues as to regional location, status etc, so should be quite neutral nom-native speakers. But there are a couple of other reasons why\u2026. As the predominant accent amongst the professional classes around London and the Home Counties, RP has long been considered the voice of the establishment. This was reinforced when the early BBC decided that not only should its presenters speak the formal, Standard BRitish English (e.g. No dialect words) they should speak it with a single accent, RP. [Whilst most presenters today still speak the formal language, other accents are now much more widely used.] People even began to use the term \u2018BBC English\u2019. Also, as the standard accent of Oxford, RP became the accent used for British English taught as a foreign language. the Oxford English Dictionary uses the IPA rendition of words in RP as its guide to pronunciation. Oxford\u2019s language teaching materials all use an Oxford RP for recordings (The Biff, Chip and Kipper apps were voiced by a non-native Chinese girl who lives in Oxford and who speaks perfect RP) How can I study British accents? Is it true that the people from USA hate the British accent? How could you tell the difference between an Australian and an English accent? Why do the British have such bad teeth? How would British people characterize an American accent? There are lots of British accents. It\u2019s inaccurate to say that RP is the British accent. If you\u2019re talking about well-educated news readers on the BBC, it would be appropriate, perhaps. Well, Received Pronunciation or RP is not a \u201cBritish accent\u201d, it is a standard of spoken English mostly used by the likes of old BBC presenters probably to make themselves understood on radio services when the quality wasn\u2019t as good as it is now. There are as many accents in Britain as there are counties. People who you would identify with speaking in RP are royalty and MP\u2019s like Jacob Reese-Mogg who really belongs in another century, lol. My dad always said that the people from Inverness spoke English as it was meant to be spoken, I don\u2019t know how accurate he was with that statement. It\u2019s fine, I guess. It\u2019s not close to accurate but it\u2019s a useful shorthand, and it\u2019s unreasonable for us to expect foreigners to have a deep and nuanced understanding of the various British dialects. Much the same as we would identify a typical \u201cAmerican accent\u201d as somewhere in the north east, or Parisian French standing in for French in general, etc. Isn\u2019t it just normal that a person that isn\u2019t from the UK refers the British accent exclusively to RP? Many people don\u2019t realise \u2018the British accent\u2019 is actually plural, meaning there\u2019re many regional accents in the UK!",

Then i did my internship and realized, most of what i learnt in MBBS was so basic i was hardly able to diagnose the patient's condition and write only basic investigations. I almost knew only 1% of what the residents ( post-graduates) knew. Then i sat and prepared for my entrance exams, learnt so much more that i felt i knew a lot now. Those entrance exams were so tough that I felt that this was the toughest phase I would ever go through. Then I chose orthopaedics. In my MS time as resident, I had to treat patients every day by the hundreds, scores of surgeries every week. Till then, the theory I had learnt was just a guidance. Every case was different, every procedure new. Initially, it was so tough, i was wondering, how could a human even handle so much. But then, I got moulded into it. The more I read, the more I realized that till then, i hardly knew anything. Can I be a journalist after an MBBS MD? How is life after MBBS? DNB or MD/MS ? which one is better after MBBS in the Indian scenario? Should I persue MD/MS after MBBS or go for IAS? Do we apply for MD colleges in India right after our MBBS is over? Brutally tough. I have 85 percentile in aiims May 2017. I will not get even close to any clinical subject . Even if i score this percentile in neet pg, i wont get surgery ms/ dnb in a govt medical college. If I do qualify this,its still 3 years of absolute break back work to get a md/ ms degree. so,in short,toughexcept for very genius students. surely it is tougher than mbbs. in md you are supposed to treat patients in opd as well as in emergency at night duty. with such a huge pressure of work you have to study as well. but the most sweet feature is that, you will be paid for your work with a handsome salary. but at last i would just say that md is tougher and there should be no dilemma about it. MD is taken not given!! This is what you are going to hear the next three years of life. Tough ..long day melting into night shifts and sarcastic professors will be your nemesis for the next three years The syllabus will be uncertain and you will watch the fate of your seniors in front of you as they quiver before the examiners!!

I think in most cases the only reason why you would choose one over another is differences in dialect and one may sound more natural than the other. Although \u201c\u4e0d\u8981\u81c9\u201d is generally the one people go for. But I would say that, in certain circumstances, choosing one over another can imply different things. Whereas \u201cdont want face\u201d often is used to talk about something that's  beinf  done, and you would say \u201cdont want face\u201d when someone is  doing  certain thing as a warning, urging them to think about the possible social ostracism that could result. Whereas \u201ccannot see people\u201d implies (again, only in certain contexts) that that you've  already  committed a faux pas and that's why you \u201ccannot bear to see people\u201d. Also is that \u201cdont want face\u201d is often used as a criticism, when you want to criticise someone for commuting a faux pas or when someone is doing something inappropriate  and  being overconfident about it. With \u201cdont want face\" there's also more of a connection to one individual, whereas \u201ccannot see people\u201d is more often used to describe something that has shamed an entire family. There's a saying in Chinese that \u201c\u5bb6\u919c\u4e0d\u5916\u63da\u201d, which literally means \u201cdont spread the family\u2019s shame\u201d because in traditional Chinese society, one person\u2019s wrong doing could easily shame an entire family and ruin the family's reputation. And \u201ccannot see people\u201d often imply something that has shamed an entire family. There was one other thing I wanted to write but I forgot. So just going to leave it at that. Why is it that a lot of Chinese people don't feel oppressed by their regime but some foreigners insist they are? Why does it seem like Chinese people don't want to speak Chinese to me? Why don't Chinese people revolt against communist rule and bring about democracy in China? Why do so many people in Taiwan and Hong Kong like to say that China is bad, yet they cannot see the great changes in China? Do the Chinese people still want Taiwan to be part of China, even after they discovered that the Taiwanese people don't want to be a part of C... \u300c\u89c1\u4e0d\u5f97\u4eba\u300dmeans shady, that is to say smth is the skeleton in the closet, and it actually means \u201ccannot be seen by people\u201d. Whereas \u300c\u4e0d\u8981\u8138\u300d is similar to being a \u201csob\u201d or the b-word, in a sense. It is used to refer to someone that does not seem to care for his/her reputation. The former (cannot see people) is generally neutral; however the latter (don\u2019t want face) is negative and could be seen as a taboo word in China. \u4e0d\u8981\u8138is a bad word, saying someone is shameless. \u4f60\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u8981\u8138\u7684\u6df7\u86cb\uff01You shameless bastard. \u89c1\u4e0d\u5f97\u4ebahas several meanings, sometimes it's a way to show humility, -\u542c\u8bf4\u4f60\u5b66\u94a2\u7434\u5df2\u7ecf\u6709\u4e09\u5e74\u4e86\u3002I heard that you have been learning piano for three years. -\u5b66\u827a\u4e0d\u7cbe\uff0c\u89c1\u4e0d\u5f97\u4eba\u3002I'm not good at it, it cannot show in front of others. \u89c1\u4e0d\u5f97\u4ebacould also mean unable to see others. \u5979\u751f\u75c5\u4e86\uff0c\u89c1\u4e0d\u5f97\u4eba\u3002She is sick, unable to see other people. actually, there are much difference between the two phrases. when you do something bad and don't want others konw, you can say :\u89c1\u4e0d\u5f97\u4eba \u4e0d\u8981\u8138is a dirty word, when others do something bad, you can say it to him. \u4e0d\u8981\u8138 Don\u2019t want face means shameless or a person who do shameful things without any concern of shame \u89c1\u4e0d\u5f97\u4eba cannot see people means too shame to let people know So it\u2019s like most shameless v.s. most shameful",

We are 2nd in population, 131st in Human Development, 168th in literacy, 134th in Global Youth development, 41st in Competitiveness, 66th in Quality of life, 123rd in Economic Freedom, 122 in per capita GDP, 66th in global innovation, 122nd in Happiness and Number One in the world for searching - \u201c How to get a visa for USA \u201d India is not even a moderately great country today, and there is no chance for us to be great in the future as well. We Indians are a bunch of morally corrupt, self centered hypocrites who just can\u2019t stop treating our nation as a large dust bin and our glorious monuments as an eternal facebook wall, liking the rule of law only if it gets applied on \u2018others\u2019 and secretly dreaming of a day when we \u2018settle\u2019 abroad and make babies which complain about our spicy food and dirty water in cute accents. Yes we had the great  Indus Valley Civilisation  that had broad roads and insanely great drainage but today, 569 Million of us defecate in the open everyday - 63 million [1] do not have access to even drinking water and over 240 million [2] among us have just no idea how it feels to sit under an electric fan. Yes, we have the world\u2019s largest democracy and a really awesome constitution but, 70 years since we got charge of things in our own hands - 50% of all our children enrolled in a school, never pass [3] class V. 8 out of 10 residents of our districts like Jhabua , [4]  which is roughly 240 kms from IIM-A, can\u2019t even scribble their own names to claim a government grant. Yes, we\u2019ve sent probes on the Moon and Mars, and have sent about 30% [5] of the Current and recent  Global Fortune 500  CEOs from our colleges - but 95% [6] of the software engineers graduating from the same colleges today, cannot even write a code. 24 [7] Indian students commit suicide every day - that\u2019s about 1 every hour - 1 student - every hour! We are a pissing, spitting, lying, backstabbing, jealous, depraved, egoistic, envious, vengeful, petty, undereducated, scantily read, chest thumping, arrogant, ungrateful, insecure, overly emotional, short cut seeking, greedy, cocky, discriminative, self contradicting, unrespectful, biased, blind and hypocritical society that loves watching trailer reactions of Baahubali 2, made by foreigners and Pakistani news shows talking about how screwed up they are in comparison to India. But it wasn\u2019t like this all the time. We too were a bunch of inquisitive minds. Out of 46 ancient civilisations tabulated by UNESCO - 45 are dead - we are the only ones who still survive. We are the same people who wrote amazing poems, designed awesome ships, invented the cutting edge in technology, weaved the finest in fashion, taught the world to measure the universe, count and have sex [8] . We had schools of philosophy, the world wanted to send their kids to, we had people who conquered empires and nations armed with just their ideologies. We contributed the same (25\u201327% [9] ) to the world economy as the whole of Europe today, and produced breathtaking stuff that the world was crazy about - so crazy that they tried for centuries to find a sea route to India and named the Native Americans after us. We were the original land of opportunities. The original destination of refuge for the hunted and the oppressed. The only land where the non-conformers, the dissenters weren\u2019t killed and arguments ( shastrarth ) were a way of life. Our best Poet, Kalidasa, was the son of wood cutters. Kabirdas was born to an unwed mother, Maharshi Valmiki, the author of Ramayana, was born into a dalit household, Ved Vyasa, the author of Mahabharata was born to a family of fishermen. Our Rishi of Rishis, Vishwa Mitra, wasn\u2019t even a Brahman - and most of us don\u2019t know this, because it didn\u2019t matter. Zero brahmins protested in front of King Bharat of Ayodhya, when his elder brother and Kshatriya Prince, killed a celebrated member of their clan, born in greater NOIDA [10] . There was a time when the tallest people in our society were those who had knowledge and those who gave up their worldly possessions. We equated a king who faced defeat, Maharana Pratap to the same pedestal as Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, a victor - just because Pratap gave up everything for his principles and never stopped trying. But today, we are a different bunch of people. We hate those who have a different opinion, ethnicity, caste, religion or color. We today are even ready to kill those who do not confirm or those who voted for someone we don\u2019t like. We aren\u2019t ready today to let our kids become anything other than doctors and engineers. We protest against the corrupt - primarily because we are jealous of them. We have a unique sense of superiority which only wakes up when a foreigner calls us poor , [11]  or a tennis star fails to recognise [12] one of our sporting stars. We never sat up and took notice when a fellow Indian was forced to carry his dead wife for 12 [13] kilometers on foot, because the administration in his village had no ambulance. Today, money is the only relevant scale of achievement in our society. Even the talented among us aren\u2019t respected until they either amass money or get awards from abroad. Our hearts have reduced in size, we aren\u2019t welcoming anymore, we have completely stopped caring about our environment, building upon the knowledge of our forefathers, trying to solve the mysteries of the universe, building amazing things, that the world loves. We have even stopped looking up at the skies at night. The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. We Indians, have decidedly stopped being awesome and great. The question is, can we do better? Thanks for reading. Cheers and peace.

India is not the greatest yet, but it\u2019s on its way.  These are the different categories on the basis of which we can compare India to other countries. In terms of military power  With strength of over 1.4 million active personnel, it is world's 3rd largest military force and has the world's largest volunteer army. Indian Armed Forces - Wikipedia In terms of religion diversity Largest  Hindu  population. Largest  Sikh  population. Largest  Zoroastrian  population. Largest  Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith  in the world. Largest  Jain  population. 9th Largest  Buddhist  population. 2nd Largest  Muslim  population. In terms of politics According to the 2010 CPI, India has a score of 3.3. That indicates a comparatively high level of corruption, as expected. But among countries in the neighbourhood, China has a score of 3.5, Pakistan 2.3, Bangladesh 2.4, Nepal 2.2 and Sri Lanka 3.2. Afghanistan and Myanmar are at a very low 1.4. The recent outbreak of scams would undoubtedly have worsened perceptions about corruption in India and our score will probably be worse if a survey is conducted right now. How corrupt is India compared with other countries? In terms of population India is projected to overtake China as the world's most populous nation by 2030. In terms of linguistics According to  Census of India of 2001 , India has 122 major languages and 1599 other languages. However, figures from other sources vary, primarily due to differences in definition of the terms \"language\" and \"dialect\". India is second on the list of english speaking countries, with 125 million English speakers. But only 226, 449 of those speak it as a first language. For the rest, it\u2019s a second language. Whatever the rank, I\u2019m proud to be an Indian. alis grave nil Hope to see you again! Aditi Goyal Nope ! We are far from great. In fact let me go one step further and say that we are dirt poor.  Yes , I said it ! Don\u2019t believe me , let me list down some points. We rank  124  in Literacy ( out of 160 countries for which data is available) 141  in Global peace index Sure our GDP is soaring and growth rate is one of the highest in the world, but we are so many people and when we look at GDP per capita , it is $6,700 , which ranks  159. This is an excerpt from PwC report , The World by 2050. \u201cThough PwC expects India to make significant strides in converging the gap with rich nations like the United States and Japan, Indians won\u2019t fully catch up with their American counterparts. In 2050, Indian GDP per capita would still be less than one third of that of the average American. There is a long way to go before Indian living standards rise to the levels of the world\u2019s most prosperous countries but, despite  short-term challenges  like rising oil prices and demonetization, optimism for the long-term is warranted. \u201d We rank  97  in Global Hunger Index ( out of 118 countries for which data is available ) Human Development Index -  131 World Prosperity Index -  104 Access to electricity -  137 .  Approximately 20% of people from India do not have access to electricity The list goes on ! So how can we be great , or even close! We still have to make our citizens aware why they should not defecate in open. And we are racist, even thought we are not white !  We are highly ignorant, and get offended even for smallest things. We rank 4th in slavery, and hilariously it is our own people who we enslave. \u00a0 We have poor roads, poor hygiene, poor healthcare !  Our children our malnourished, uneducated and pushed to work at a young age. Heath care is a joke. What is affordable is of poor quality. We have no control as of now on population growth and the demographic benefit that we have over China , I am not too sure we will take much benefit of it. Our biggest resource , i.e.  Human resource is very poorly skilled. And all of these problems are not going to disappear, not anytime soon. But , I do not have much problem with this as much as I do have with how people behave in this country.  All we do is be proud of our past. Countless movies have stupid conversations of how India is land where the idea of  zero  originated, of Indus Valley civilization , the golden age of India ; of how we built temples cut out of mountains, roads that connected mountain to the sea, our great art and culture. All the chest thumping! Some one  may  have said that India is poor country , and we got offended.  And the best we could manage is give them a poor review, so helpful. Indians in our imagination live in high rising towers in Metro cities, posting happy and merry pictures on Instagram. Well we are poor, dirt poor! These are the words of Raghuram Rajan. I cannot get euphoric if India is the fastest-growing large economy, we cannot get carried away by our current superiority in growth, for as soon as we believe in our own superiority and start distributing future wealth as if we already have it, we stop doing all that is required to continue growing. This movie has played too many times in India\u2019s past for us to not know how it ends.\u201d And somehow , somewhere this idea developed that we are great. I do not blame the OP; there are hundred of answers on Quora, where we are boasting and insanely proud of our achievements.  ISRO launches 104 satellites and nation goes crazy. We have stopped questioning our policies , we blindly follow our politicians (not stating any particular party , don\u2019t get offended), and are not thinkers anymore. We act as we are supposed to act! Let\u2019s not get complacent and spiral down into our own devastation. Thanks for taking out time to read.

Few More Facts About India 22. that\u2019s the India that was before hitting 21 st century 5 Major Challenges That India Will Continue To Face In 2017. Still No Solution For These! Every passing year is rewriting the glory of India as a nation of great potential, a young, vibrant and emerging economy, a source of human resources to the world. Since 1991, though unhurriedly, India has moved far ahead but a lot is yet to be done. Right from social evils to natural resources, India is still not in an ideal position to call itself a prosperous nation. To mark 2016 as a year of marvellous success and to continue efforts towards the goal of establishing itself among developed & peaceful nations, I believe that the following five major concerns are needed to be addressed at a greater pace. Quality of Education and Unemployment India has evolved a significant change in terms of \u2018quantity\u2019 of education.  \u201cSince 2000, when countries committed themselves to the global education goals, India has reduced its out of school children by over 90% and Universal Primary Education has been achieved.\u201d  according to  UNESCO . But the \u2018quality\u2019 of education lags far behind, about 69 percent of unemployed Indians are educated but lack adequate skills, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry. As per the  Pearson  Voice of Teacher Survey, 75% teachers have called for restructuring of course curriculum in collaboration with industry to provide better employment opportunities to students. Outdated learning and teaching practices, lack of career planning and exposure results into the education without actual learning of how to get things done, without complex problem-solving skills, without knowing how to put their theoretical education into practice. Gender Inequality and Rapes Gender discrimination continues to be an enormous problem within Indian society. Gender inequality persists in India despite of economic growth and modernisation. In 2014, India ranked 127 out of 146 countries in UNDP\u2019s Gender Inequality Index with a value of 0.563. Though PM Modi led government has launched several commendable schemes to save and educate the girl child but that would not work unless people stop treating girl-child as inferior. The situation is worsening due to increase in number of rape cases every year. As per  National Crime Records Bureau , there is an increase of 900% registered rape cases in India over the past 40 years. In every 20 minutes, a woman is raped. One out every three victims is under 18 & one out of every ten victims is under 14. There is a higher probability that only one out of 100 rapes is reported. Health & Infrastructure India owes 21% of the world\u2019s disease burden and unacceptably high rates of maternal and infant mortality. It is horribly worsened by the burden of infectious diseases and a dramatic rise in non-communicable diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic respiratory conditions. It accounts approximately more than half of all deaths. It is estimated that over 63 million Indians are affected by these diseases in 2012 alone. India also lacks in adequate infrastructure, according to WHO recommendations there should be at least 3.5 beds for 1000 people, but there are only  1.3 beds in India  for a population of that size and just  one doctor per 1700 people . According to a study conducted by WEF in collaboration with the Harvard School of Public Health, India stands to lose $6.15 trillion due to non-communicable diseases and mental disorders by 2030. Poverty and Rising Social Inequality India is home of a third of the world\u2019s poor and hungry. One out of four people in India is hungry and every other child is suffering from malnutrition. The 2010 Multidimensional Poverty Index showed that 8 states in India account for more poor people than a combined of 26 poorest countries in Africa. In 2011, India was ranked 73rd out of 88 countries listed in the annual Global Hunger Index, six places down from the previous year. On the other hand, India also houses the second largest number of affluent people in the world, with three million households having over $100,000 of investable funds. The gap between rich and poor is continuously widening. Adequate efforts are not made to uplift poor population, and this is worsening by inflation and corruption. If judged by the median developing country poverty line of two dollars a day on purchasing power parity, more than 80 per cent rural and just below 70 per cent urban inhabitants in India continue to be poor Water Scarcity and Increasing Pollution Natural resources in India are strained by its continuously increasing population. It has only 1,000 cubic meters of water per citizen, and it is quite less compared to the \u2018water-stress\u2019 level of 1,700 cubic meters of water per person. According to a report by WHO, 97 million Indian citizens don\u2019t get clean water. The World Bank estimates that 21% of communicable diseases in India are related to unsafe water, and it causes more than 1,600 deaths every day. It is followed by pollution as 13 out of top 20 most polluted cities are in India. Air pollution reduces life expectancy by almost 3.2 years for over 660 million Indians who reside in cities. The impact of rising toxins in the air is clearly visible as air pollution ranked sixth in top reasons that cause death in India, according to a Lancet study. SOME DISTURBING INDIAN TRUTHS:- 1.

        "a": "There are players who are charismatic, and others who aren't. Players who create magic, emotion! They connect with the audience. The connection in talking about is a subtle thing \u2026 some other answers have mentioned nationality, for me it is the ability to play in a particular way. I would watch those players, men or women, and gender is not a consideration. If there are two or four players on one court, and a different set of two or four on another, I would choose to watch those who excited me the most. These days, among the women, I like watching Halep. I dislike watching a scream fest like Sharapova. I like to watch Petra Kvitova when she is playing in full flight. Muguruza is fun too. I wouldn't choose to watch Murray, for example. The negativity is just too much, and his brand of tennis is boring to me. Would someone like watching an Isner vs. Karlovic match, instead of Konta vs. Halep? Was it the right decision for Roger Federer to skip the French Open? Why? Consider a tennis match in cold weather where both the players and the spectators wear the same clothes. Which group of people will feel colde... How can I watch live matches of tennis for free? What should one eat before a tennis match? What is the best serve and volley match in tennis? I can think of three reasons I would watch a woman\u2019s tennis match even when there are men\u2019s matches going on (as I have done at the French Open). I have tickets for a particular court at a particular time (think Centre Court at Wimbledon). I like a particular female athlete and want to watch her. As a serious tennis player myself, I can relate to women\u2019s tennis more than men\u2019s so I learn more and enjoy watching women\u2019s matches. To continue with the same bit of logic. I usually prefer to watch a doubles match (men\u2019s or women\u2019s) because I play doubles more than singles. The caveat to all of that is that there are certain male players that I would watch anytime any place (e.g. Federer) and once you get to the quarters of a Grand Slam, I\u2019m picking what I watch based upon who\u2019s playing. Sure they might. Some tennis officials have said recently that men's tennis brings in the fans and the money that is generated through fans. But here in the US I would say Serena Williams is probably the only professional tennis player who is well known, and who most people would recognize. I am a tennis fan and was able to see Roger Federer recently, but I would have walked away from that match to watch Serena. Well, truthfully, the men\u2019s tennis would be the preference\u2026\u2026\u2026there\u2019s always exceptions, depends upon if the men playing are well known!! It depends on the players involved! If someone I admired, and was a fan of, I would check them out! Luckily, usually, one can move around to different courts, depending on the tournament. So I could see them both. Sometimes there are seat assignments. Many times I check out the major player on court for a short time, then go watch doubles! Sometimes I get lucky and get to see the top 20 singles players playing doubles, which is a treat! For me, anyway! Who would not want to see Nadal, Federer, Murray, Serena, Venus, Jelena, etc play dubs!?",

There are a lot of resources that don't always have to cost a lot and they can save your life; ED is deadly and is very difficult to overcome without professional help. Additionally tell someone you trust if you haven't yet, ED thrives in secrecy. In the meantime, you can try some of these approaches: Scheduled Eating Make it a point to eat something at each meal time. Have a full breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And incorporate snacks. Try not to focus on what is and isn't healthy yet, just work towards eating at regular intervals. Mindful   Eating With ED, it can often be hard to gauge how you feel. Are you hungry? Bored? Thirsty? Stuffed?Use this card to gauge how you're feeling before, during, and after meals. It will help you begin to get a sense of how much food you need to sustain yourself and have energy. Categorizing Food DONT DO THIS. Work to stop thinking of some foods as good and others as bad. Just think of food as the energy you need to get through the day. Talk Again, talk to someone about this. You'll get some advice on Quora but the real help isn't on a screen but in someone you can trust. Find a therapist and a nutritionist and talk to a family member or a friend you trust. Identify the Source Eating disorders are not about the food. Yes that's right. I'll say it again,  eating disorders are not about the food . They're about your emotions, your experiences, and your sense of self. The food is a way to avoid the pain you feel. And it seems scary to overcome ED because to do so, you do need to face the real issues. I encourage you to just give it a chance. Try to talk to someone. Try to get help. I believe in you and it doesn't always have to be like this. Distraction Binging happens in privacy, when you have time alone, or when you're bored. Pick up a new hobby, start volunteering for a local organization. Look into big brothers big sisters, local animal shelters, or a soup kitchen. Fill up the extra time with rewarding social interaction instead. Start knitting to keep your hands busy, learn to play the guitar. Anything really to fill up time that may otherwise be spent eating. Believe in  You . Believe in yourself. Wake up every day and tell yourself that you are enough. Tell yourself that you're strong and that you are beautiful. Tell yourself that you can overcome the impulses. And on the days you don't believe that, say it anyway. Say it twice. Say it each day until you start to believe it. Tell yourself you will recover because you are stronger than your ED. If you ever have questions, you can PM me but I'm not a professional, just someone who understands. I truly wish you the best. How can I become bulimic? I want to have some control in my life. How could you self-cure bulimia? I just found out my best friend has bulimia. How can I cope with this guilt? What does it feel like to be bulimic? How can I recover from bulimia as a child? Hi. I am a compulsive eater and bulimic. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever not be. But it\u2019s been five years since i last binged or purged. I always wanted to be thinner but i never wanted to stop purging, I thought it was my silver bullet - the answer to my problems. Even though my teeth were rotting, I lost my voice every few weeks and i was using my infant son\u2019s plastic cutlery to shove down my throat and make myself sick (it was soft and didn\u2019t scratch my throat). Even though i couldn\u2019t eat around other people. Even though after lunch at work i made myself sick in the toilets at work. Even though i went through chewing gum like a hot knife through butter. Even though i was pale, sweaty looking, spotty and had bad breath. I kept Binging was my only joy. Purging was my only release. In 2012 I joined overeaters anonymous. I KNOW - it is a twelve step programme and there are elements of it that talk about God and that\u2019s not for everyone. I don\u2019t believe in God, but I believe I will do anything to stop stuffing food in my face and vomiting until I have broken capillaries on my face. So i follow the steps. Do what my sponsor says and I am ok today. In February 2012, I stopped eating sugar and cheese - my two key binge foods. I never purged again. Without sugar and cheese, I lost the urge to eat and eat and eat. And without the urge to eat and eat and eat, I didn\u2019t need to purge. I dropped weight and now I\u2019m a healthy size. I don\u2019t weigh myself because i know any growth in size will send me into a spiral again. You can recover. You\u2019re not alone although I bet you feel lonely right now. You\u2019ll be ok.

        "a": "Statistics suggesting that up to 7% of women have had gay or bisexual experiences as opposed to only 4% of men may be misleading. On one survey, any sexual experience between two women was reportable, but experiences between two men were only reported if they included oral or anal sex. And the research is all based on self-reporting. We might speculate that straight guys who experimented with gay sex, perhaps many years before, may not report it due to a perceived stigma that is not the same for women. It\u2019s not clear that men\u2019s sexuality is any less fluid than women\u2019s in fundamental ways. More women report having same-sex relationships Do men prefer women who make less than them? If so, why? If not, why? Or does it not matter to most? Is it true that women enjoy life more than men? Are men on average smarter than women? Why or why not? Do women in general have more distaste for profanity than men? Do women sacrifice for men more than men do? Most research has confirmed that female sexuality is more fluid than men\u2019s. You may not be able to read the full text of these articles without university journal access, but the abstracts will tell you the basics. These are just a few of the articles you can find if you Google female sexual fluidity, and especially if you add .edu to your search or search PubMed. A New Paradigm for Understanding Women's Sexuality and Sexual Orientation Sexual fluidity in young adult women and men: associations with sexual orientation and sexual identity development Female bisexuality from adolescence to adulthood: Results from a 10-year longitudinal study. What is Sexual Orientation and Do Women Have One? You state that as if it is fact, but it is not fact. What is fact is that society is much more comfortable with women being sexually fluid than men, and that therefore women are easier out as sexually fluid than men are. Until society is really open about different sexual orientations, we can\u2019t really do a proper estimate of number of people who are straight, lesbian/gay or bisexual/fluid. You\u2019re not familiar with the history of ancient Greece, areya? Homosexuality in ancient Greece - Wikipedia I think you're confusing quite a few things here. The \u201cfluidity\u201d of sexuality exists when there is some predisposition already. That is innate. You. Could be like a 2,3 or 4 on the Kinsey scale, and therefore have some fluidity and choice that 100% straight or gay people (1or 5) don't have. Culture doesn't influence sexuality. It can influence sexual behaviour. Sometimes if a person is starving they will eat awful things to survive. Same goes for sexuality. You see this in prison populations. Some people are so desperate for any human contact that they'll just take what they can get. This is related to women having terrible experiences with men. Sometimes another woman seems like a safer choice. Particularly if the woman can't fall in love with another woman. No risk. Also hardly any benefit. But, people can do whatever.",

        "a": "SAP HANA smart data access enables remote data to be accessed via SQL queries as if they are local tables in HANA, without copying the data into SAP HANA. Not only does this capability provide operational and cost benefits, but most importantly it supports the development and deployment of the next generation of analytical applications which require the ability to access and integrate data from multiple systems in real-time regardless of where the data is located or what systems are generating it. Smart Data Access is a technology which enables remote data access as if they are local tables in HANA without copying data into SAP HANA. \u00a0It is based on local virtual tables that maps to an existing object at the remote data source site. Data required from other sources will remain in virtual tables. Virtual tables will point to remote tables in different data sources. It will enable real time access to data regardless of its location and at same time, it will not affect SAP HANA database. \u00a0Customers can then write SQL queries in SAP HANA, which could operate on virtual tables. The HANA query processor optimizes these queries, and executes the relevant part of the query in the target database, returns the results of the query to HANA, and completes the operation. Restrictions on usage of Smart Data Access: \u00b7 Data in virtual tables cannot be modified i.e. insert, update and delete operations are not possible on virtual tables. However, we can do select on virtual table and put data in HANA table. \u00b7 Virtual table does not support BLOB/CLOB data type. Workaround of this problem is to create view on remote table by excluding column of BLOB/CLOB type and then create virtual table with the help of view. \u00b7 Virtual Tables cannot be used in multi node HANA cluster. However, it is possible to access virtual table from one HANA server to other. \u00b7 Some analytical view does not support virtual tables. What is SAP HANA Cloud Platform? How can I explore about SAP HANA? What is a reference on how SAP HANA Vora is accessing data from Hadoop? I could not find any info in this area. How do I get into SAP HANA from SAP basis? Will SAP HANA replace BW/BI? SDA is a method of SAP HANA for accessing the data stored in remote data sources. With the help of SDA, SAP HANA can create so-called \u201cvirtual table\u201d mapping to tables located in remote data sources, and then SAP HANA can access the data directly by accessing the \u201cvirtual table\u201d. \u201cvirtual table\u201d can be manipulated by SAP HANA just like an ordinary table, which means the operations, such as select, update, insert, delete, and so on, are all available for \u201cvirtual table\u201d. Besides, join operation between local table and \u201cvirtual table\u201d is supported. When such join operation taken, optimizer of SAP HANA sends the relevant operations to remote data source for processing, and then the result set would be sent back to SAP HANA for further processing.",

        "a": "Wow, it's been a long time since I heard the term \u201cbatty\u201d used. Unless I'm mistaken (not impossible!) this would place you in the Caribbean area. My BF and I were called \u201cbatty man\u201d when we were visiting Barbados in the 80\u2019s and I've heard the term used in news pieces regarding folks in Jamaica. So going by that and having a general idea of how poorly accepted LGBT+ are on the islands, I also would suggest caution as the repercussions can be rather strong. The culture, as I understand it and this is simply from occasional reading/seeing reports about gay folks there, indicates that attitudes are very strongly anti-gay and that violence is not particularly discouraged by society. Probably in large part due to a heavy religious hand in the area mixed with plain cultural ideas. Still, there are out LGBT+ people and there are groups that can offer support. I would urge you to seek such support groups wherever you are (whether my guess on your location is core t or a major fail) and talk to people who are familiar with the situation in your local area as they'll have a much better sense of social reactions, what resources may be available and offer just plain old peer support- the value of which cannot be understated - that is relative to your particular surroundings. You have access to the internet and Google can help you locate such groups near you. Don't be scared to talk to or email them; they\u2019ve all been where you are now and know how scary coming out can be. They\u2019re already rooting for you even if they've not yet heard about or from you. Their hand is extended in friendship and support, you just need to reach out to them and make that contact. Even if at first it is purely online and you choose to stay anonymous, you can still get help from others in the community you live in, who will have a greater grasp of the social temperature you are in than just some random dude like me who lives thousands of kilometres away. You deserve to find your community and make bonds of friendship with your LGBT+ family. I truly wish you the best of luck and hope you can both expand you \u201cbatty\u201d family and get the help you need to come out, safely and proudly. How do I come out to my dad? I'm gay, how do I come out to my friends and family? How do I come out of the closet? I grew up in a family in which being gay/bi is the worst. How should I tell my family? Should I come out to my coach? How do I know I'm ready to come out to my parents? A batty boy huh? God I haven't heard that term in a long time. Anyway just confide in someone you are close to and who loves you very much, like a close friend or one of your parents. Good luck. I would suggest starting by moving to a place where gay people are accepted or at least tolerated both legally (not jailed for being gay) and socially (not subject to being killed by an angry mob). That is not an easy proposition. It will take a lot of work and a lot of courage to save up enough and make the move. I wish you the best.",

        "a": "Not a damn thing. This may be disappointing to some but it is the truth. A nuclear warhead will only detonate if it is armed. These are very sensitive devices we are talking about here. The design of most nuclear warheads especially, old fashioned gun-type and implosion type bombs, require very precise timing of its plastic explosives to happen in order to shoot the uranium down the \u201cbarrel\u201d into another uranium mass in order to create a reaction or in the case of implosion type bombs the simultaneous detonation of its explosives in order to reach critical mass and create a full scale explosion. If this doesn't happen the bomb will \u201cfizzle\u201d and either be very underpowered or just turn into a dirty bomb essentially. I say that nothing will happen because of two reasons. Other nations wouldn't respond because they wouldn't have anyway of knowing if there was a nuclear warhead onboard the missile unless they actually came and inspected it. The other reason is that these things are designed to withstand reentry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at something around Mach 23 on average. They can take some punishment and would most likely survive the explosion of any missile or rocket that had launched them. I'll put it this way, if I was in a firefight and had to choose behind taking cover behind a nuclear warhead and a wall made of concrete or steel I would take the nuclear warhead. Even if the warhead was armed at the second it takes off (Pretty much never since there are accelerometers that only arm the warhead when they detect that all the rocket\u2019s stages fired for the right amount of time) then the nuke could honestly just be recovered and repaired if any damage did occur. If the warhead was really damaged then they could recycle the plutonium. Semper Fi Edit: The United States uses bombs with neutron generators nowadays so it's even less likely that the warhead would detonate. (Like no chance at all) What would happen if N. Korea followed up on its threat and launched a nuclear strike against the US? How would the US respond (2013\u201317)? Who has the best ballistic missile and missile defense system? What would happen if a nuclear bomb carrying missile is intercepted and destroyed in mid air? What happens to the nuclear warhead on a missile that is shot down by missile defense systems? How long does it take for a missile to lock on to something? Is it instant or does it take a few seconds? A high rate of attrition is expected. The US assesses the capabilities and readiness of potential adversaries in regular reviews of the nations strategic war plans. Countries like North Korea may only be rated at a very small percentage of successful launches. The US reliability of its ICBM fleet sits at about 93% through its regular scheduled testing, meaning something between 25 and 30 missiles would be expected to fail in an all out war where all the missiles are launched. [1]  Whereas a reliability estimate of 80% is used for planning purposes.  [2]  The Russian and Chinese system reliability is rated much lower with their mixed fleet of old and new technologies and continued use of liquid propellants in some cases. It is hard to pin a number on their reliability as the data isn\u2019t readily published. The bottom line is that failures are expected and anyone designing an ICBM and its associated warhead is going to plan for this. The chance of an accidental detonation or a rupture of the warhead spilling its contents is very low. It isn't zero, there is a tiny chance but you would likely win the lottery first. Footnotes [1]  New Details Emerge About U.S. Nuclear Missile Test Failure [2]  http://www.belfercenter.org/site... Something similar happened. A worker dropped a wrench while working on a Titan II missile. It hit the side the way down and h a fuel tank. The silo filled with the toxic fuel forcing an evacuation. The design of the missile required pressure in the tanks for structural stability. When enough fuel leaked out, the missile collapsed. The fuel for the Titan ignites on contact and the missile exploded in the silo. It destroyed the silo and launched the warheads several hundred metres. The casings were cracked but did not detonate. Some excellent answers here, so I have very little to add to the raft of comments about how a nuclear warhead will not detonate in the event of a launch pad fire. Two additional points of note: The launch pad explosion scenario is a drawback with liquid-fuelled rockets, not so much with solid-fuelled (which every Nuclear armed nation, except North Korea, now uses). Solid-fuelled rockets will continue to burn like a giant firework, but are unlikely to explode because the oxidiser is spread throughout the fuel mix. Liquid-fuel is essentially a binary explosive, however. A big tank of LOX will make pretty much any fuel explode if the flow is uncontrolled - as would happen if a rocket\u2019s fuel tank ruptured. The result would be a fire with some radioactive materials within it. Depending on the intensity, those materials might burn too, in which case there would be radioactive smoke released in the local area. A lot of the material carried in the smoke would be comparatively safe after a few days, but some Caesium and Strontium isotopes remain dangerous for decades, while any Uranium oxides might stay \u2018hot\u2019 for thousands of years. The amounts contained in a nuclear warhead are many times smaller than in a reactor like Chernobyl or Fukushima, though, so an environmental clean-up is completely possible. Secondly, missiles generally have remote-controlled or pre-programmed abort software (AKA \u201ckill switch\u201d), so if they are flying when they malfunction, they can be destroyed mid-air. This mitigates the risk of burning/exploding materials falling to the earth. Advanced nuclear war heads require the conventional explosive charge detonate in perfect sync with the activation of the neutron source. If the neutron source goes off without the explosives or vice-versa, either nothing happens or you just get a fizzle (which becomes a dirty bomb if the warhead subsequently impacts something that breaks it into pieces). The circuitry is carefully designed so that only a proper activation command can cause the combination of factors. Advanced nuclear weapons use as little as possible primary nuclear material (the highly enriched Plutonium or Uranium) both to minimize its mass and to reduce the risks of even a fizzle. Unless the weapons is properly armed, it can\u2019t detonate. It cannot create a proper nuclear explosion. The ballistic missile works much like as if its a manned bomber. It only sends the command to the war head to arm near the release point when the re-entry vehicle separates from the last stage of the ICBM, and only if the ICBM is flying within parameters, much like a B1 crew wouldn\u2019t arm a nuclear weapon unless they are at the right point to release it.",

The cops, FBI, nobody knows where the laptop (the proof!) went! Probably because Obama or someone high up and connected to Hillary, covered it up and made the laptop \u201cDisappear\u201d, just like her 33k emails and like 13 blackberry\u2019s. When the PI hired by the family is coming out saying, holy crap something is here\u2026 There is something to it! So instead of answering questions like, \u201cHillary, please tell us how Seth Rich was killed after he leaked your DNC emails to WikiLeaks\u201d, they blamed Russia.",

        "a": "No. If a teacher doesn\u2019t \u201crespect your rights\u201d then you have no obligation to respect that teacher. You should be reporting them to your school principal. However, be careful. The only way a teacher could be disrespecting your rights is if they are deliberately ignoring you because of an inborn trait (discrimination), treating you differently than another student because of an inborn trait (discrimination), or they are mentally/physically harming you or someone else. If you suspect your teacher simply doesn\u2019t like you, but they are still teaching you, and the class, that isn\u2019t really a violation of your rights. That\u2019s just the teacher not liking you. Also, if a teacher tells you not to speak during a lecture, that ISN\u2019T a violation of your right to free speech. It\u2019s him or her just telling you to be quiet so that they can teach the class. Please Note: This answer is not legal advice, and I am not a lawyer. As a teacher, how do you get all of your students to respect you? As a teacher, how can I get my students to like and respect me? If your parents are being disrespectful to you do you still respect them? Should I be nice to a teacher who I don't respect? What should be done to respect your teacher? In the past teachers were to be accorded people's respect - automatically - and the same was true of authority figures in general - and automatic respect given to teachers and authority figures was even more expected of you if you were young and a student.  But that's changed in modern America- respect is no longer automatically granted to anyone by virtue of age or advanced years or their position in life. What occasioned that change doesn't change anything - so yes it seems to be true if you're in step with modern times and modern values in the U.S. - you can for the most part withhold your respect. That does not mean however that you can resist authority and easily get away with it. Obedience and compliance are not one and the same thing as respect and they are still expected.  If teachers treat students disrespectfully - they send the wrong message. Teachers should model the behavior they expect from students. If teachers want their classroom to be a place where courteous regard reigns - they should set that tone and treat their students with courteous regard. You don\u2019t have to respect your teacher. When you get out there into the working world, you don\u2019t have to respect your boss. But the way you feel and the way you behave are two different things, and you\u2019ll consistently find that behaving disrespectfully toward authority is not to your advantage. Do yourself one of the biggest favours of your present and future life and don\u2019t treat authority with disrespect. If you have a legitimate complaint about the way you\u2019re being treated by a teacher, a respectful discussion with him or her often resolves the issue. When it doesn\u2019t, your recourse is to respectfully appeal to a higher authority, which in the present situation is the school administration. It\u2019s possible to stand up for yourself and be confident and assertive without being disrespectful. That\u2019s the key to this aspect of life, and that\u2019s the life skill you have to cultivate (again, in your own best interest). It shows maturity on your part that you\u2019ve spotted this issue, so I have no doubt that you\u2019ll succeed in resolving it. The ancient Romans had this saying about parents, which you can also apply to teachers: \u201cIf your parents are fair, love them; if not, put up with them.\u201d As a student, showing disrespect for a teacher will always get you into trouble. By the time the principal\u2019s office finds out that your mean, disrespectful, miserable and bittered teacher is a real SOB, you\u2019ll have been kicked out of school, years will have passed by, and you will all likely be raising your teen kids. As much as you can, don\u2019t draw that teacher\u2019s attention and interact with him/her as little as possible, till the course is over.",

People who move to a different area in adulthood generally never lose their accent. Why do I say mid-teens? I\u2019m sure it depends on the person but, it\u2019s for this reason: Two American youngsters, a brother and sister joined my school. The boy was 13. The girl was 16. After 2 years the boy had no trace of an American accent. His voice was completely anglicised. After the same 2 years in the same environment, his older sister still had no trace of an English accent. What does your accent sound like in English? If I moved to the UK from America, would I develop an accent? How long would it take? What can one do to avoid picking up a regional accent? Or better yet, what can one do to reverse having picked one up? Do adults pick up accents? How long does it take to adopt a new accent? We don\u2019t, we learn to speak slowly enough for the English to hear it. When I moved to England to work I was in a team with an Aberdonian and two English people. If the two Scots wanted we could exclude other people from a conversation just by speaking at our normal speed. Our boss used to say that she hated the two weeks after Christmas because we had reverted and she couldn\u2019t understand a word we said. She also used to claim that before the telephone Scots spoke at English speed. It depends on the person. My mother came from Edinburgh and lived in London for 50 years after the war, but had a distinctive Scots accent after all that time, although she didn\u2019t sound as broad as her sisters - but she soon reverted back to it when in their company. I\u2019d say if you are pretty young, say 12\u201313 you might lose your accent when you move to an area with a different accent, but if you\u2019re a bit older, say 16\u201317 you won\u2019t. Of course, if you really want to get rid of your accent, you can deliberately copy the locals, that depends on how good you are at copying accents, otherwise you might come across a a bit fake.",

I don\u2019t know if I am annoyed or entertained by this question because it\u2019s so obvious it depends on  you . But let\u2019s make an example if you want. Say you want to improve your English because in September (suppose you already are at a B1 level and it\u2019s May, so consider a three months span) you\u2019ll take a course completely in English. Your goal is to improve your understanding of academic texts,and ultimately being able to follow a lecture, to answer questions and write essays pertaining to the field of the course. At the same time you want to improve your focus, but do not want to spend the whole summer just learning English. Now that you have defined your needs, try to define what activities you are going to do. I am hypothesizing a case where you want to move from a B1 to a B2, let\u2019s add the supposition that you are interested in human behaviour. In order to improve reading comprehension skills, you will read Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (around 500 pages, a non fiction book - still not academic, but also not fiction) In order to make sure you will be able to follow a lecture, you decide to watch all Robert Sapolsky\u2019s  Human Behavioral Biology  with subtitles on (around 35 hours) In order improve your writing skills, you will write a summary of what you have learned both from the book and the course. Now, you have three months, total work time is around 90 hours, so you could easily do one hour of study everyday and you would still succeed. Suppose you don\u2019t feel like studying during the weekend, so you will study 1.5/2h everyday. Or maybe you prefer making a schedule in terms of stuff done, so perhaps you could read 10 pages per day and watch one lecture per day intervalled by days you write. What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever said in a foreign language by accident? What is the easiest spoken language to learn? Why is Turkish difficult to learn? How do I make Cloze sentences when learning a foreign language? How do I quickly and efficiently learn a new language? I think we are in the same boat here. I have tried to come up with a schedule for learning Spanish multiple times, and I have failed every single time except this time. I thought of applying a formal way of learning, as if I am in school. I allocate at least half an hour at least 3 days a week, the idea being every 30 min session is like a lecture. Language learning requires discipline and constant practice. We managed to learn a language in school because it was part of the schedule every week. It is absolutely useless if we practice every day for a week and then forget about it for a month. I break down my sessions as follows: 10 minutes of  Duolingo  (2 to 3 rounds) 15 - 20 minutes of either listening to a Spanish podcast Or 15 - 20 minutes of reading a news article in Spanish Throughout the session, I try to make notes and also try to speak out loud some of the phrases. This way, I learn new words, I learn how to read, I learn to interpret conversations by listening to dialogues in the podcast and by making notes, I learn to write. Hope this helps. All the best!

If we consider, P=1/log(-1), Then, after simplifying, e^(1/P) = -1 or 10^(1/P) = -1 (considering both the bases) But as we all know that e^x or 10^x both the functions are always greater than 0 (you can see the graph of these functions). So the above equation is not valid. And hence the figure asked is undefined. Thanks. Hope it helps. PS: My consideration is only in real math, if you consider complex part then as per Euler\u2019s formula we can find the answer as 1/i\u03c0 and log10/i\u03c0 (for both e and 10 respectively). Log of number less than or equal to 0 is not defined. If f(x) = log(x) Then Domain of f (I.e. values that x can take) is strictly restricted to Real numbers greater than 0. The reason is that If y=log(x) Then x = e^y Now for any real value of y, x can never be less than or equal to 0. So buddy, your question is wrong as log(-1) does not exist.",

You might be able to empirically determine the pKb for an electride solution in DMSO, assuming that the electride would be stable in DMSO. Reaction-wise, it would behave as a base. It's the purest base you can find: a dissociated alkali metal, with a free electron ready to attack anything organic it can find. The conjugate acid of an electron is a neutral hydrogen atom.",

        "a": "It\u2019s suggested that most wizards don\u2019t really care about house-elves; they use them as tools and don\u2019t bother studying and delving into their powers. Harry and Hermione are exceptions: they were raised by Muggles, therefore they\u2019re free of any preexisting bias and prejudice, and Harry specifically is known to be very kind towards all those who are marginalized and wronged. It\u2019s likely that a lot of wizards (perhaps including Voldemort) don\u2019t know the full extent of the house-elves\u2019 power or don\u2019t even think about them. Moreover, Voldemort is deeply racist. He views half-human and non-human creatures as inferior to wizards, Muggleborn wizards as inferior to those who have magical ancestry, half-bloods as inferior to pure-bloods, and everybody as inferior to himself. He would never use a house-elf as a means of transportation or a companion; Kreacher he used as a guinea pig, he didn\u2019t count on him for something dangerous and risky that needed trust. Last but not least, Voldemort  didn\u2019t want  to enter Hogwarts; not only was he afraid of Dumbledore and wouldn\u2019t risk a fight with him, but there was nothing there for him. Only towards the last chapters of  The Deathly Hallows  did he need to invade the castle, and there was no house-elf around at the time. It would absurd to call off the attack and try to find an elf, especially when there were defenders everywhere in the castle; Voldemort needed to defeat them, not simply sneak inside. Which Hogwarts House would you be in, and why? Why didn't Slytherin house take part in the Battle of Hogwarts? Which Hogwarts house was Mad Eye Moody in? At Hogwarts, is it possible to switch houses? What house was Cornelius Fudge in at Hogwarts? Voldemort didn\u2019t understand house-elf magic; therefore, it never would have crossed his mind that such a thing as taking mastery of and then ordering a house-elf to take him into Hogwarts was possible. He didn\u2019t use Kreacher\u2019s magic to Apparate to the cave, and he certainly didn\u2019t know or suspect that Kreacher would Apparate off the island. When Dobby first meets Harry Potter, he informs him that under Voldemort\u2019s time, house-elves were treated \u201clike vermin.\u201d Given how poorly we see the Malfoy\u2019s treatment of Dobby, we can only wonder how much worse did it get. We saw in the books how Dobby circumvented the Malfoys, and how Kreacher betrayed Sirius. Doubtless any house-elf hapless enough to have been forced to serve Voldemort would have found some way to muck up the trip, perhaps by Apparating He-Who-Was-Nasty-To-House-elves into a wall, or better yet, directly into the u-bend of Moaning Myrtle\u2019s toilet. He never knew elves could apparate despite the protection spells. Otherwise he wouldnt take Kreacher to his childhood picnic spot where he did the Slytherin locket (horcrux) to check out the effects of his crazy potion on Kreacher (that Dumbledore drank). He wouldn't have left Kreacher to die there along with the horcrux secret as he planned. And then, RAB would never know through Kreacher about the horcrux. What Voldemort didn\u2019t respect and value, he didn\u2019t take the trouble to understand. He therefore never realised that house-elves could bypass some wizardly restrictions. That\u2019s why Regulus Black was able to find out about the locket Horcrux, because Voldemort never realised Kreacher could get out of the Horcrux lake by himself. That was one of the mistakes that contributed to his downfall, you know. Voldemort was the most arrogant wizard that ever wizarded. The idea of asking a \u201clower life form\u201d which is what he though house elves (along with muggles and anyone that wasn\u2019t a pureblood wizard) for help would never have crossed his mind. I\u2019m pretty sure he could have. But I don\u2019t think he thought of ever using house elves for anything other than cleaning up and making meals.",

In many countries being an open atheist (especially criticizing religion) would get you ostracized, disowned, jailed and even extra-judicially killed (eg Bangladesh). Should atheists stand up and be willing to die for spreading science and truth (eg Jesus, Sikhs etc)? Why or why not? No. Atheism is recognition that one sincerely has no belief in any god or gods. Atheism is  not  worship of science. A dead atheist changes no lives. (Martyrs are remembered for how they  lived , not how they died.) More is accomplished by bringing information to young people (those I call \u201cthe kids in the bleachers\u201d) than by confronting the old guard who are set in their ways. Dying is always the last option, to be used only when there are no others. Do any atheists find Jesus's death very sad? Why do some people persecute atheists? What is the meaning of death in one word? What is the stand of Sikhism on atheists? According to atheists, what happens after death? If you are ready to stand up for science, education and the freedom to believe in whatever goes against the convictions of the opressive regimes which rule in the countries you mention, then that makes you an invaluable person in the struggle against such regimes in that, you can have a far wider impact while  being alive , and keeping to your well-being as best as possible. I like to give  Salman Rushdie  as a prime example of that, as well as his influence on Christopher Hitchens\u2019s antitheism and the debates about the ill effects of religious conservatism and fundamentalism. You do not need to become a martyr for that cause in order to make a contribution to the enlightment of such societies, not with today\u2019s media outlets and technologies, anyway. If you or someone else you know is about to risk his life in that respect, then  I urge you  to change your mind and come to a country where your support for science can be valued on a higher level, and ultimately may even lead to the change of some minds in the society you left! No. It\u2019s important to spread knowledge, and to advocate for the truth. Being an atheist is not something you should be willing to die for. At one point, you couldn\u2019t be openly atheist anywhere, but thanks to people breaking out of their shell over the years, we have some countries where they can be openly atheist without deadly repercussions. In other territories, getting yourself killed is NOT helping anyone. You want to spread knowledge, do so without putting yourself at risk. It will take longer, but will have fewer causalities in the long run. Believers standing up for their faith in defiance of death is a different matter. They earnestly believe that they have to swear allegiance and loyalty to their god, and that death is not the end for them. Atheists have no such allegiance. All they have is this life. They have everything to live for; nothing to die for. Expect changes to be slow, budget for some frustrations in life, because life is still beautiful overall, and you should try to enjoy the journey as much as you can. Should atheists stand up and spread science even if it means persecution and death? In many countries being an open atheist (especially criticizing religion) would get you ostracized, disowned, jailed and even extra-judicially killed (eg Bangladesh). Should atheists stand up and be willing to die for spreading science and truth (eg Jesus, Sikhs etc)? Why or why not? There is no \u201cshould\u201d involved. Some atheist in some situations will put their lives on the line. Other atheists won't. Those are individual decisions, and only the atheists involved have any say in what they \u201cshould\u201d do. as I am a pacifist, I would say no. But then again, I do think that freedom of speech is a very high moral value. So one does need to be able to defend it. Furthermore, the uncovering of truth and the progression of science is very important as well\u2026 Discrimination is also something that needs to be defended. As such, I can imagine that I would be willing to put myself at risk in certain situations. But I think the best weapons we have is education and the seeds of doubt and curiosity. Even if you are not an open atheist, you can sow the seeds of critical thinking (even on totally other aspects of non-canonical superstition) and make vague allusions or analogies. SO: preferably: don\u2019t get killed or ostracized if you can \u2018fight\u2019 in a more subtle way.",

Most often it is that they have witnessed or are a product of abuse themselves. Is that a potential aspect in your nephews life that could be contributing to his behavior? If so then I suggest that you should deal with the root of the problem in order to have him leave the animals alone. Can I turn my dog into a pelt? Can I feed Parle G biscuits to stray dogs? How do I take care of a street dog puppy? Which biscuit is good for a street dog? My mom is scared of street dogs. How do I convince her to buy/adopt one for me?

SPOILERS for GotG2 When Ego was telling his son Peter about his \u201cpurpose\u201d, he made a 3D illustration of himself pulling some kind of squid-looking thing from his neck region and planting it in the ground. This is how he has colonized planets throughout the galaxy. I garden, so this is the way I look at it: The way Ego spreads these extensions is very much like plant division. Because some plants spread by root division, periodically you must divide the new smaller plants from the older one and plant them somewhere else (so all of the plants will be healthy and free of pests & disease). Ego feeds his colonies remotely with the light inside himself, but the film doesn't show exactly how he does this. What we  are  told is that he alone cannot feed them enough to accomplish his self-imposed purpose. He needs another celestial's power combined with his to make his plan work. The colonies simply lay dormant until Peter comes along. Ego is essentially a parasite, intent on changing the planets he's colonized into plastic paradises. So when he \u201cuses Peter like a battery\u201d (his words, not mine), these colonies grow and grow. If allowed to grow unchecked, I imagine they would eventually engulf and smother each planet. Then I suppose Ego might build more empty, sterile and derivative \u201ccivilizations\u201d (like what we see in the film) atop the remains of other civilizations.

        "a": "Allah SWT, was concerned, as you say, about Muhammad \u2018s PBUH personal life because He(Allah) wanted to make him an ideal for all mankind. He says so, in the Quran. You have indeed in the Messenger of Allah an excellent example for him who hopes in Allah and the Last Day, and who remembers Allah much. (33:21). In this verse Allah instructs Muslims to follow Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) who was an embodiment of the great values and manners of the Holy Quran. He gave the best example for mankind in the human history. Many Muslim and non-Muslim writers bear witness that Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) is the greatest man in the human history. Why did Allah grant Prophet Muhammad basically free access (sexually) to any woman that he wanted? Is Muhammad a true prophet? Is prophet Muhammad father of Allah? Allah came in my dream and asked me to write a book. Am I going to be a prophet? And he told me Muhammad was an imposter. Why is there an obligation by Allah to regard Muhammad as last prophet to become a muslim or a true human being? Simple reason is, Allah was Muhammad\u2019s imaginary friend made real by \u2018faith\u2019 of the naive followers of Muhammad. And it worked out damned well for him then. Note the pattern: Muhammad wanted to do something that's taboo in his culture, so he went to his imaginary friend, Allah, and tell Allah to tell him it was okay to do it. Then Muhammad told his followers Allah told him it was okay. Get it?",

        "a": "Yes, snakes absolutely have ears. What snakes do NOT have are the external structures of the pinnae, auditory canal, or the tympanum (eardrum). They still have structures we associate with the middle ear in other vertebrates, as well as the inner ear (with cochlea, semicircular canals, and sacculus). In other reptiles where the columella bone runs from the ear drum to the oval window on the inner ear, in snakes it instead runs from the quadrate bone of the lower jaw to the oval window of the inner ear. This has some serious implications on how well snakes hear, though. The tympanum in other vertebrates acts as a large, easily moved surface to pick up sound vibrations, particularly those of relatively higher frequencies, for transferal of that energy to the inner ear for reception. The jaw bones in the snake do much the same function, but beings as they are attached to quite a bit of muscle, ligaments, skin, etc., this dampens the higher frequencies as the jaw bones cannot vibrate so quickly, and leaves the snakes with a fairly narrow, lower frequency range of hearing. Due to this arrangement, this is why snakes \u201cat rest\u201d often have their heads planted firmly on the ground, to help pick up any vibrations with their jaw, but studies have shown they can still hear some sounds (of sufficient intensity and frequency) in the air, as well as pick up strong vibrations with their whole body that are conveyed to their ears. Interestingly, although a rattlesnake can feel the vibrations of it shaking its own tail, it is unlikely to be able to actually hear the sound it is producing! Skull of a modern snake showing the relation of the columella bone (in blue/green) with the quadrate and the inner ear (red). What does it feel like to be eaten by a snake? Do snakes have ears? What do baby garden snakes eat in the wild? Do snakes like water? Can all snakes swim? Which snake can this be? Yes and no \u2014 that depends on what you mean by ears. They do not have have outer ears or ear openings of any kind, but they do have inner ear structures that allow them to hear far better than was originally assumed. (And not just picking up vibrations through their jawbones).",

        "a": "Thanks for A2A. As far as film schools are concerned, these 5 are among the top. 1. Film and Television Institute of India, Pune: Among the top five the most preferred is  Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune . It was established in 1960 and is currently celebrating its Golden Jubilee year. The ambience of the place is filled with best aspects of film-making. It is considered as a centre for excellence not only in India but also abroad. Its alumni include such luminaries as Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi, Jaya Bhaduri, Subhash Ghai, Mani Kaul, Shatrughan Sinha, Mithun Chakraborty, Tom Alter, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Raj Kumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Oscar winner Resul Pookutty. The campus covers an area of about 30 acres and is planning to add 27 acres of land behind the present building for an international campus. \u201cWe believe in giving students the freedom to interpret and learn things their way. So we don\u2019t follow any textbook rigidly. Apart from some basic principles and theories, everything is fluid,\u201d  says Kedarnath Awati, professor of music. It offers courses in Direction, cinematography, sound recording and sound design, Editing, Acting, Art Direction and Production Design, Animation and computer Graphics and Feature and screenplay writing. Apart from Acting, where it takes 26 students every year, all the other courses take 14 students. Excluding the above courses, it is also introducing new courses in film management, ad films, television journalism and 3D animation, and these courses will have a batch of 30 students, 2/3rd of the students being Indians and the rest foreigners. For admission in the above courses one must need a bachelor degree. For animation and computer graphics course one must clear XII class examination. Physics at the Plus Two level is essential for those seeking to study audiography. To support these courses this institute has outstanding faculty. Students get hands-on knowledge in all aspects of filmmaking and television. It is equipped with two film studio floors and two television studios and in sound department it is exclusively equipped with Harrison audio mixing console. It has a spacious film and video library with a good collection of films and videos all around the world, and also a computer library has been set up recently. 2. Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, Kolkata: Next to FTII is Satyajit Ray  Film And Television Institute (SRFTI), Kolkata , established in 1995. It is an autonomous academic institution and is administered by the ministry of information and broadcasting of the Government of India. Similar to FTII, it also offers Post graduate courses but only in four areas, they are Direction in screenplay, audiography, editing and cinematography. There is abundance of opportunities for the students as they are allowed to watch films in the institute. The institute consists of two theatres; one is main theatre and the other is called preview theatre, in addition to this there is also an open air theatre and also 35mm and 16mm screen projection facility. Libraries are brilliantly equipped. Batches are limited to 40 students and SRFTI attracts some foreign students as well. The institute has a canteen and provides hostel facilities. And if someone wants to try out for Fiction and Non-fiction Movies production and everything related to it then SRFTI is the best option! 3. Whistling Woods International, Mumbai: On the Top Five list third comes  Whistling Woods International, Mumbai , established in the year 2006. It is chaired by the iconic Filmmaker and leader of Mukta Arts Production, the showman Subhash Ghai. The campus is designed with expert guidance of Australian Film, Radio and Television School. It offers a balanced, modern and complete course to the film making industry. It gives unparallel training in different aspects of Filmmaking. The infrastructure is fabulous and is geared with all the latest equipment. You can get every detail of it on their website. The Whistling woods International Offers full time intensive courses which span over two years. The specializations available are: Acting, Cinematography, Direction, Editing, Business of Film & Television, Sound Recording, Design and Music Production, Animation and Screenwriting.

Rahman, Dilip Kumar, Javed Akhtar, Mahesh Bhatt, Om Puri, Ramesh Sippy, Shabana Azmi, Ashutosh Gowariker, Nagesh Kukunoor, Satish Kaushik and many more as the faculty and part of the advisory board. Now, what more can we ask from this institution? The Institute is also helping students from less affluent backgrounds in getting loans and scholarships. Mind You guys and girls, this is the Institute which is totally equipped with Sony Media Technology! And it is a platform for any of the aspiring candidate from all kinds of backgrounds as they have the chance to make their dream come true. Overall, WWI is modernized, amazingly equipped and it will give hands-on approach to both theoretical and practical aspects of filmmaking and television. 4. Center for Research in Art of Film and Television, Delhi: The fourth on the list is Center for Research in Art of Film and Television (CRAFT), Delhi which is a non-profit, non-governmental organization registered as a public charitable trust to impart quality education in the field of film, television, and other media arts through short and long-term courses with specialization in various disciplines. It was established in the year 2009. This one has a low teacher-student ratio, with 10 seats per course, guest faculty from the Mumbai Film Industry, training oriented towards film aesthetics, hands-on experience based on current industry requirement and rigorous training assuring guaranteed top placements. It is offering all the courses that FTII is offering and it also includes News Reading, Creative writing and Radio Jockeying. But the sad thing is that it doesn\u2019t provide any accommodation for the students. Facilities are comparatively poor and faculty, though good, is not as impressive as the other colleges mentioned here. Overall, CRAFT is not so bad when it comes in satisfying students in terms of Teaching. 5. Asian Academy of Film and Television, Noida: The fifth college is Asian Academy of Film and Television (AAFT), Noida. It has been training students in the art and craft of filmmaking since 1993. The Academy was built as an alternative to formal film schools and since then has established itself as one of the best film institutes in India. It proudly stands as the only film school in this part of the world to be certified by ISO 9001:2000 (International Organization for Standardization). AAFT is offering four types of courses- 3 months course, one year diploma, two years diploma and 3 years course. These programs are taken into account based on the impact of media present in the day to day life. AAFT offers almost all the courses one wishes of when he/she is thinking of making filmmaking/television as their life\u2019s goal! All the modern facilities needed for the curriculum are present at AAFT, which includes 6 shooting floors, conference rooms, Rehearsal hall, film club, library, private screening rooms and 16 air conditioned class rooms. The health conscious students can use the gymnasium or they can play games like badminton or volleyball in the ground attached to the hostel. Students living in the hostel often get the opportunity of observing professional filmmaker and television producers at work. Security as well as an attendant have been provided round the clock at the hostel. The placement of AAFT students is looked after by a special cell for rendering opportunities in the film and television industries, and since its inception the faculty of AAFT has been known for properly guiding and helping the students with their placement in the industry. The students are also given opportunity to work under Mukta Arts Ltd., Venus Ltd., Tips india ltd., Maruti International and also B.A.G Films. Overall, AAFT is fifth best among the 5 options!!",

It\u2019s not that uncommon to hallucinate, and all sorts of things can cause it (not just mental illness or illegal drugs). I would suggest talking to a doctor just to make sure there\u2019s nothing wrong.

Please note I\u2019m not a doctor, toxicologist, psychologist, or an expert in any field whatsoever.

However, if you definitely want to narrow down to just 1, that'd be dependent on you and what field you plan on entering upon finishing your studies. For now, starting out, since you can't decide what to choose, in your first year take courses from both disciplines. Hopefully that will help narrow down your choices. Also as mentioned before, at the undergraduate level you could always double major or do a major in one field and a minor in the next. After which, if you plan on going grad school, you could work on a project that combines the two fields. The world is getting more digitised, so I believe computer science would be an asset to go along with any other discipline.",

I then have to get a Certificate of Origin (a Certificate that declares the produce is an Australian good) and there's alot more to it and alot of paperwork. To answer your question briefly if the goods were of high quantity exceeding say a gift size order from a friend, you would probably need a registered import business and a contract of sale and then you would pay for any import taxes, customs duties and any problems that may arise when importing. Depending on your Terms of Trade with the supplier. Lots to consider! It ain't easy and it's a good thing for trade business, it protects businesses who do it legit.

What if the United States have a State in Europe? How close are we from forming the United States of Europe? I am 18 and live in Colorado (United States). I want to buy a large knife.

If however we are discussing heroin, you are going to run into a few more \u201choops\u201d. You are going to have to learn about import regulations in the USA, depending on the product possibly export controls in the country of purchase.

It is a mental development when start acting like an \u201cadult\u201d physically and mentally. Let me tell you something, adults are children in the most complex form. Complex because they\u2019re capable of seeing right and wrong but yet acting weird all the time. I cannot agree that a person makes perfect decisions in all scenarios. Even the most mature people have emotional downfalls, yes it\u2019s true. But those on the better side of the maturity scale make lesser judgemental errors i believe and that\u2019s why they are called more \u201cmature\u201d than others. So i believe even the mature people  think   like you and me  but with more clarity in their thoughts which comes with experience (not age). Even a 16 year old becomes mature when she loses her mother at that age, so age is not a factor definitely. Stay happy :) What is maturity? How do I think and behave like a mature? Why do people cheat on their partners? At what age are people mature and stable? Why do some people act mature? Now just because i answer this dont think i am matured enough.! I act highly immature in many situations. But with my interest in observing people thoughts and behaviour, also with my interaction with many matured humans, i can try answering this. When we know that our life is short- and we have only a little time to live our life, we will stop running over material things, gushing over silly matters, and start enjoying their life. Dont get confused over mature people and serious people. Mature people are those who enjoy little joys- little laughs, little accomplishments, and they appreciate life. They know they have no control over society or people and let go of things and accept people as they are. They wont be judgemental, they wont gossip about you, they will forgive your mistakes. They love to live their life in a peaceful way and will have a high EQ. in a conflict- they hear both sides, try not to offend anybody and deal with the issue in a diplomatic but positive way. Dont wont get angry very fast, we cannot find them in gossip groups. you will get the best advice from them, and will give you different outlook about life every time we talk with them - Now these are some of the general characteristics i found - Hope this helps. Mature people are actually free from all type of bondages. They do what they like. They think freely. They take responsibilities of there actions and its result. They are independent. They first believe in ourselves,then others. They have decisions taking abilities in any type of situations either it is good or worse. They follow there passion. They work like a team leader.",

If you are under age 30 then the relationship is probably based on planets - such as Mars/Venus or Sun/Moon. According to statistics, the number of marriages between  Taurus Men and Aquarius Women  is not a lot different to what can be expected on average. However, that between  Aquarius Men and Taurus Women  is extremely unlikely - to a highly significant extent. It is this kind of difference that indicates relationships are not just based on random chance - where everything would even out. In addition, the significant differences plus or minus can be shown to relate to Astrological Principles. Taurus Male - Aquarius Female Actual Marriages 2,654 Expected on average 2,701 Variance (-47) = less likely, but not a significant difference Aquarius Male - Taurus Female Actual Marriages 2,544 Expected on average 2,705 Variance (-161) = extremely unlikely. A significant difference. You do not state your age, which is important, because before age 30 our Moon birth chart position has greater influence on us as individuals, and other planets are more significant to a relationship than just Sun Sign.

As you reach Mid Life Crisis age in your 30s you will probably begin to experience friction between you as the Sun Signs begin to operate more fully, and will need to seek new joint goals - or the relationship will probably end. This is at a time when the human body starts to deteriorate - as evidenced by athletes being unable to compete with younger people, and women coming to menopause. So our natural energies start to decline - and we need to call on our \"inner Sun\" which has not been fully used until this time. I have added the Spiritual Lessons of the Sun Signs below. The eventual friction of relationships between them is due to the Zodiac Signs both being in \"Fixed\" Mode. Taurus is Fixed Earth and Aquarius is Fixed Air. So there is likely to be a clash when individual changes are necessary. The Lesson of Taurus is based in learning to establish the Self on a stable practical and material basis, which means it is slow to change after establishing a secure home base. The Lesson of Aquarius is to establish the Self as an INDIVIDUAL - separate from the rest of Society - and the Spiritual journey often demands a lone path of SELF DEVELOPMENT later in life. All this is open to individual Free Will. At another level, there is the possibility of Negotiation between couples to enable more freedom in the relationship, or establishing new joint goals. It is important to be clear about what the immediate goals are in any relationship. We do not even ned to like someone if we share the same objectives. You will see below a diagram of Maslow's \"Hierarchy of Needs\" which indicates how, we move on to the next (it omits Spiritual Development as a goal). We can get \"stuck\" at any level. Many people do not achieve their Sun Sign potential. I had a friend who married 4 times and was still unhappy because te relationship stopped him doing things he wanted. =========================================== THE INDIVIDUAL LIFE PATHS TO COME =========================================== YOUR FUTURE : SUN IN TAURUS The main principle of Taurus is concerned with learning how Earth supports growth. If we are spiritual beings, why do we need an earthy existence? The Taurus lesson is basically that of learning to control practical, material, affairs. Until we control Earth, it controls us. For example, homeless people will not be able to focus on anything other than day to day existence. Taurus is the Fixed Earth Sign, and gives a slow, steady, release of energy. You were born at the time when the earth was thawing out after the Winter cold, and beginning to form the foundations for new life. Just like the earth at that time you are \"slow to warm\". Taureans are forced to be patient. As \"The Business Manager and Farmer\" they need to ensure that they are helping make progress rather than just being stubborn and obstructive from fear of change. \"Change is Stability. Stability, Change\". That which stops growing dies. Taurus is also in tune with the cycles of Nature. The lessons are concerned with care and support of a physical body and its need for a steady routine. This can also be referred to other \"physical bodies\" such as work or businesses that depend on routines, and cycles of work. Taurus brings great practical abilities. There is also need to learn how to handle practical resources, such as in organising ones home, or using money. Taurus will take on routine jobs that other people would find boring, and provide Stability and Organisation - once their lessons are learned. Taurus likes physical comfort, and, although some Astrologers say that Taureans like money, I believe that it is mainly because they like their comforts - and Quality rather than Quantity. The guide to how well progress is being made will be how well one is self supporting, and one's state of health. Taureans have a great deal of physical strength and it takes a lot to upset them. The lesson of Taurus is related to the Aesop Fable of the race between The Tortoise and The Hare. The Tortoise won. ----------------------------------------------------------------- YOUR FUTURE : SUN IN AQUARIUS The basic lesson of Aquarius is that of the Jungian Path of Individuation, when we separate out from the Collective Society to become an Individual using Free Will. This is rather a task for the second half of life in the 30s and 40s. We develop our own specific abilities and put them to service of the Whole. This path is not open to all because it generally requires the acceptance of a lone pathway. Having had a \"normal life\" experience we have a Mid Life Crisis from which we find our true path. We still have Free Will, and need to make choices. Doors are opened, but we are not necessarily pushed through. That means you will tend to be very independent and challenge traditional values. You may not marry - in fact, this may be a symptom of the need to challenge traditional values. This does not mean you are without close relationships, only that you will tend to dispense with the formality. Another symptom of this is the tendency to embrace \"New Age\" subjects - such as Computing and Technology. You are also among the rebels of the world. This could be a rather negative reaction. You need to realise that, rather than wasting energy trying to fight society, your true purpose is to discover and follow your True Path apart from what you were born to expect. By fighting society we allow it to have power over us. We waste energy. If you are truly democratic you will realise that anyone is entitled to a fair trial. The first step towards this is becoming materially self supporting. This is usually accomplished based on parental upbringing and \"programming\". The next step is separating from the family of birth and finding ones true personal life path. Life events that encourage this usually occur after age 30 we have our first Saturn Return (to the same position it was when we were born). Read about the psychologist C.G.Jung's concept of \"Individuation\" for more information. You will be most creative in teams or groups of people dedicated to some form of personal or social development, especially when this is related to New Age subjects. This could be in such areas as Politics, Alcoholics Anonymous, Yoga, Meditation, Communications, Media, Scientific Laboratories - and so on. You will work best in groups or teams dedicated towards some agreed joint goal. You could become involved in illegal activities. =============================== SUN SIGN MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE STATISTICS In the book \u201cThe Astrology File\u201d by Gunter Sachs he was able to obtain marriage and divorce statistics from the Swiss \"Federal Office of Statistics - Population Development Department\" for marriages between 1987-1994 which included the birth dates of both partners. This consisted of data for 717,526 people (368,764 couples). 1. He sorted data into the 144 possible combinations of Sun Signs. 2. He then compared it with what would be expected on average using the same set of data. Some data showed positive variances, others negative, with fewer marriages. MORE INFORMATION There is more detail in my message here, where it shows that the results comply with Astrological Principles : Brian Baulsom MNFSH's answer to Are there any statistics to show marriages between astrology sun signs? =============================== THE SPIRITUAL PURPOSE OF LIFE The Spiritual Purpose of a lifetime is a personal, individual, one - we come to this earth alone and leave it alone. The Basic Life Lessons of your relationship are below. Although it is ridiculous to assume that humanity can be divided into 12 easy \"parcels\", the Sun Sign is important as indicating the basic Spiritual Purpose of a lifetime. The more practical details as described by the other planets in a Birth Chart may vary considerably. In early life the main focus is the need to become financially independent, separating from the parental home, and \"putting down roots\" of your own. It is important to realise that when we are born we relate more to our Moon Sign than Sun Sign, the change-over tends to occur in our 30s. You will therefore need to be aware that relationships will change as time goes on. So if the Sun Sign Lessons are not compatible, relationships are not likely to last beyond this time unless there is some form of mutual support, a shared goal, or shared interests. Relationships tend to last until they have fulfilled their purpose. It is people that make relationships, not Astrology. We do not even need to like somebody if we are working toward the same goal. For example, for businesses to succeed they need different people with different abilities. A football team only needs 1 goal keeper. Everything depends on what goal we are trying to achieve. Early on in life this is to separate from our parents to get our own home and family. Once this is achieved there needs to be a new joint goal otherwise the relationship, having achieved its task, will end. However, if people share the same Spiritual goal, they are more likely to stay together. It helps to be clear about what you are trying to achieve. An important point to consider is that ANY ASPECT IN A BIRTH CHART CAN BE OVERCOME BY FREE WILL. For example, we do not even need to like someone if we are working towards joint goals - and that of early life is to become self supporting away from parental controls. Once we have achieved that, there is more opportunity to be free to develop our Sun Sign POTENTIAL. Some people never do that, and just keep repeating the past. A sense of boredom with \"the rat race\" sets in, and the tendency to try to relieve it by such things as getting a new job, a bigger house, or a new partner. All this does is temporarily relieve the boredom until the new cycle is complete. I had a friend who married 4 times and was still unhappy because the relationship stopped him doing things he wanted to do, and by then he was too old to do much about it. ========================================================= ASTROLOGY AND SYNASTRY The art of comparing 2 Birth Charts to see what the relationship is like is called \"Synastry\". You will see that, although the Sun Sign is important for individuals, it is often less important than other factors in relationships - especially earlier in life, when the biological urge is to reproduce. You need to decide this for yourself. FREE WILL Like anything else in Astrology, Synastry has its limits in that human consciousness and Free Will can override any factor. Also, relationships can be formed on different levels - such as for sex, common interests and hobbies, or business. This means that we have to take into consideration is why the partnership exists. If it is just for momentary sexual satisfaction then it is unlikely to last long. If it is to get a home and family then the tendency is for the relationship to last until children become more independent and then a sense of boredom sets in. There may be attempts to recover the past with more children, or a bigger house, but it does not last. This leads to the Mid Life Crisis, and a more lone spiritual path of self discovery - or repetition of what has gone before. SYNASTRY - BIRTH CHART COMPARISONS One technique is to compare the Mars position of one with the Venus position of another. Mars shows how we get what we need, and Venus shows what we need. So the comparison shows how one person satisfies the needs of the other. The relationship here tends to be at a sexual level. In a birth chart the Moon position shows what we have learned from past lives, or family tradition, and the Sun shows what we have come to learn in this lifetime. So it is natural for our Moon Sign to attract people with their Sun in that Sign to learn from us. For example, I knew a lady with Moon in Leo who, when she saw her birth chart, realised why many of her men friends were Sun Leo. (She might have had similar lady friends too). This also gives an interesting insight into what the actual level of attraction is. Generally, people are drawn together in partnership to learn from one another and produce something that is the fruit of the relationship, which could relate to children or other joint venture. Interestingly, there is a significantly high Divorce Rate between Sun Gemini men and Sun Capricorn women. I am Sun Gemini, my wife of 25 years had Moon in Gemini (Sun in Capricorn). I had a partner with Sun in Libra, I have Moon in Libra. =================================================== How do I get my Taurus man to propose to me? Will a Taurus man with a Gemini Venus ever be loyal? What is the best star sign to date if you\u2019re a Taurus? Will I get married? Can I get married? You can marry whoever you want. You don't need the permission of some stars and planets for that. So yeah it's irrelevant whether you are Taurus or Aquarius. I don't think so. From personal experience. No matter how hard you want it to, there's going to be a lot of misunderstandings. It just didn't work out for me. But can't really blame it on the stars :)",

This is because  antipodr  tells me that Australia is the closest land mass to being on the exact opposite side of the world from me as I\u2019m sitting here, and thus the availability factor is pretty dang low. (Love the accent, though!) What, you were expecting there to be a factor other than availability that would make an entire nationality \u201cless desirable\u201d? Does the height of a guy really matter when it comes to dating? Is it true that black guys are the least desired race for girls of other races to date or marry? When it comes to dating women, how nice is TOO nice? Are Iranian women open to dating guys who are not of the same nationality? Dating Advice: People tell me I come off too strong. What can I do about this? The most desirable country to date, depends upon if you are a man or a woman. As a woman, I suspect that the 5 countries that I would avoid are: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cambodia, Senegal, Egypt and Zambia, as these are the \u20185 Countries Where Spousal Abuse Is Viewed As Acceptable By Women\u2019. I mean if the very women that are subject to abuse, think abuse is acceptable, I darn well don\u2019t want to date any of the men\u00b9. Now if I am a man, it has to be the USSR. I must have 100 beautiful ladies from all over the Russian Federation that have sent me e-mails that are desperate to meet this 65 year old, overweight, bald guy. Oh and me being married is apparently not an issue to them either! I just wish I had $10,000 more dollars to send Svetlana, because her visa is being held up at the Russian embassy. And she may have a sister, because I got another e-mail with a picture that looks just like my beautiful Svetlana but her name was Allyssia, come to think of it, she may have a bunch of sisters. Seriously guys, beautiful women are ripe for the picking on every corner in Russia, so take a basket along to scoop em all up!\u00b2. I mean for every 100 women in Russia, there are only 87 men, so if you go over to marry a beauty, the 13 extra should be easy to spot (if they are not married they should be smiling!). Now if you are a woman, definitely Do Not Go to the UAR The United Arab Emirates as there are 274 men for every woman. I mean dang it all girls, you could not even make it from the airport to the hotel without being besieged by dozens of handsome sheiks driving Lamborghinis. And if you did pass up the Ferraris and BMWs, and step out off the cab at the hotel, you would be ankle deep in mysterious Lawrence of Arabia types who would woo you to become a member of their harems. Now as to my particular situation; I am the luckiest guy in the world! I found the love of my life in college in 1970, and she has been the angel (as my beautiful wife for the last 45 years) who has been kind enough to put up with me and my wacky sense of humor. re: JHS \u00b9 5 Countries Where Spousal Abuse Is Viewed As Acceptable By Women \u00b2 Why the former USSR has far fewer men than women",

        "a": "The NBA champion would win easily. The USA Olympic team has more talent, but the fact that it sometimes struggles against inferior national teams exposes the problem: the team is hastily cobbled together with a short training camp, and is poorly coached. The NBA champion is used to playing together, and is always excellently coached. This is more than enough to make up for the talent gap. Think about it: Australia almost beat team USA in 2016. Could the Cavaliers or Warriors beat Australia? Of course. By 30. I have always thought that this is what USA Basketball should do: send the NBA champion to the Olympics, with non-Americans replaced by Americans at the coach's discretion. Is any NBA team a good NBA team to play for? I'm 17. If I start playing Basketball right now, can I become a professional, play in some great teams, maybe get into NBA? Why do NBA teams wear white when playing at home? Why is there a Canadian basketball team, the Toronto Raptors, in the NBA? Why is there only one? Would the worst NBA team clean house against the NCAA champion? All answers here saying that the NBA champions would win are wrong. The USA Olympic basketball team has 2\u20133 months of training together. The USA Olympic Basketball team is not even an All Star team. All Star teams have players only from one conference.  The USA Olympic Basketball Team is the NBA All Star Team, less a few players. The 2016 NBA Champions were the Cavaliers. Of course Lebron was not on the Olympic team and Kyrie was and Kevin Love didn\u2019t make the cut but other than that, all the Cavaliers players are far worse than the Olympic team. For the USA Olympic Basketball Team, players like Demar Derozan and Jimmy Butler come off the bench. Paul George comes off the bench. The NBA champions would look like the Brooklyn Nets playing the Golden State Warriors, done after three quarters. Cleveland Cavaliers vs 2016 US Olympic Basketball team. Assuming Cavs get Kyrie back, and all of LeBron\u2019s players are at 100%, I\u2019ll still say it will be the 2016 US team only because of depth and youth. If the Cavs roster were all in their early 30s or late 20s, I\u2019d bet on the Cavs (Korver in his prime is a threat) but age is a huge factor once you\u2019re past 32 or 33 and 2016 US team are full of young guys with Melo being the oldest at 32. They also have Durant over there, the second best player in the league right now. The Cavs would be blown out but LeBron will have the best stats in that game. The Olympic Team. The team is built with the best players in every position. The US team, arguably, has no weaknesses. Starting line ups may be a fair matchup (they probably aren't) the Olympic bench will destroy the Champs bench. The Olympic team is younger, better shooters, more athletic, and probably better defensively than the NBA champs. They would win hands down. Teamwork is very important in basketball. However the almost all if not all the NBA team is composed of players coming from all-over the world\u2026",

        "a": "Godwin Goziem Jireh  has a very good answer to which I would like to add a few more verses and comments. Proverbs 10:19 (Holman Christian Standard Bible), \u201cWhen there are many words, sin is unavoidable, but the one who controls his lips is wise.\u201d Proverbs 18:21 (HCSB), \u201cLife and death are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.\u201d I\u2019ve been in conversation with others (it mostly happens with women, I\u2019m sorry to say) where I\u2019ve seen the principles in the above verses in action. It\u2019s so easy to fall into gossip in these situations. The apostle James has much to say about the tongue, also\u2026 James 1:26 (NASB), \u201cIf anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man\u2019s religion is worthless.\u201d James 3:5\u20136 (NASB), \u201cSo also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire! And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell [Gehenna].\u201d James 5:8\u201310 (NASB), \u201cBut no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison. With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God; from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way.\u201d Being an introvert, I\u2019m not known for much talking. (My husband once said I act as if every word costs me a dollar.) I\u2019ve still had to learn to curb my tongue when I wanted to say something about someone else that no one else needed to know. Sometimes the only way to deal with this is to call upon the Holy Spirit for help in reining in our tongues. I can attest to the fact that He\u2019ll do it \u2014 if we mean business with Him. What does the Bible say about gambling? What does the Bible say about burning it? What does the Bible say about cheating? What did the Bible say about the soul? What does Bible say about India? The Hebrew word translated \u201cgossip\u201d in the Old Testament is defined as \u201cone who reveals secrets, one who goes about as a talebearer or scandal-monger.\u201d A gossiper is a person who has privileged information about people and proceeds to reveal that information to those who have no business knowing it. Gossip is distinguished from sharing information in two ways: 1.Intent. Gossipers often have the goal of building themselves up by making others look bad and exalting themselves as some kind of repositories of knowledge. 2.The type of information shared. Gossipers speak of the faults and failings of others, or reveal potentially embarrassing or shameful details regarding the lives of others without their knowledge or approval. Even if they mean no harm, it is still gossip. In the book of Romans, Paul reveals the sinful nature and lawlessness of mankind, stating how God poured out His wrath on those who rejected His laws. Because they had turned away from God's instruction and guidance, He gave them over to their sinful natures. The list of sins includes gossips and slanderers (Romans 1:29b-32). We see from this passage how serious the sin of gossip is and that it characterizes those who are under God\u2019s wrath. Another group who were (and still are today) known for indulging in gossip is widows. Paul cautions widows against entertaining the habit of gossip and of being idle. These women are described as \u201cgossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to\u201d (1 Timothy 5:12-13). Because women tend to spend a lot of time in each other's homes and work closely with other women, they hear and observe situations which can become distorted, especially when repeated over and over. Paul states that widows get into the habit of going from home to home, looking for something to occupy their idleness. Idle hands are the devil's workshop, and God cautions against allowing idleness to enter our lives. \u201cA gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid a man [or woman] who talks too much\u201d (Proverbs 20:19). Women are certainly not the only ones who have been found guilty of gossip. Anyone can engage in gossip simply by repeating something heard in confidence. The book of Proverbs has a long list of verses that cover the dangers of gossip and the potential hurt that results from it. \u201cA man who lacks judgment derides his neighbor, but a man of understanding holds his tongue. A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy man keeps a secret\u201d (Proverbs 11:12-13). The Bible tells us that \u201ca perverse man stirs up dissension, and a gossip separates close friends\u201d (Proverbs 16:28). Many a friendship has been ruined over a misunderstanding that started with gossip. Those who engage in this behavior do nothing but stir up trouble and cause anger, bitterness, and pain among friends. Sadly, some people thrive on this and look for opportunities to destroy others. And when such people are confronted, they deny the allegations and answer with excuses and rationalizations. Rather than admit wrongdoing, they blame someone else or attempt to minimize the seriousness of the sin. \u201cA fool's mouth is his undoing, and his lips are a snare to his soul. The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to a man's inmost parts\u201d (Proverbs 18:7-8). Those who guard their tongues keep themselves from calamity (Proverbs 21:23). So we must guard our tongues and refrain from the sinful act of gossip. If we surrender our natural desires to the Lord, He will help us to remain righteous. May we all follow the Bible\u2019s teaching on gossip by keeping our mouths shut unless it is necessary and appropriate to speak. https://www.gotquestions.org/gos... What does the Bible say about gossip? I believe the 9th Commandment of the Ten Commandments found in  Exodus 20:16: \u201cYou shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.\u201d says it all.",

        "a": "Tough question. Depends on how flexible that skill is and how wide of a market it has. For instance, Oil and Gas. If you are an Oil Field worker and the market dips, your skills in the oilfield doesn't carry over to much of anything else. Highly specialized but at that moment highly useless. Is there no good career/future for a less skilled coder in IT? What is that one skill you are extremely good at? How did you master it to that level? How should one prepare if he knows he might be blind in the future? What life skills and career choices can he prepare for, and how? What is better, learn and be good at a lot of skills, or completely master only one skill? How do I know the level of mastery I have in a certain skill? In my opinion you shouldn\u2019t be just either, but a bit of both. Most professions require a certain depth of knowledge in job or task specific areas, and being a real expert in some fields, areas or skills can give you a competitive edge over others. On the other hand, if your field of expertise is too limited, you\u2019re not flexible to adapt to other tasks or challenges or you lack the ability to see beyond the scope of your work, see the \u201cbig picture\u201d, then your career options may be limited as well. We are constantly living and operating in changing environments, different jobs or roles, so you want to make sure you\u2019re not too limited in your options. I just recently worked with a bunch of IT guys and engineers on a project on client relationships. They all had realised that just being really really good in their technical areas of expertise wasn\u2019t enough to keep their customers happy. They lacked the ability to communicate certain aspects of their work or identify more subtle, less tangible personal needs of their customers. The point was that they all had in depth expert level skills in their technical fields, but they also worked on a broader level of other skills necessary to survive in jobs where comunication skills, negotiation skills, influencing others, presenting their concepts etc. was critical to their success. There was no need to become the best in any of those additional areas, but without a basic foundation in those areas they were a step behind those people who had these broader sets of skills. By the way, it\u2019s often exactly the other way round with people working in communication roles lacking technical skills. You would have to identify which skills \u201con the side\u201d are or will become relevant to succeed in you specific role from a more holistic point of view. Very Very broadly: Do you want to be an expert or a manager? This is the old classic issue with \u201cT-shaped\u201d career learning - especially for technical people. You first did \u201cbroad\u201d, then as you got more experience, were expected to \u201cgo deep\u201d. I have a good friend who can be counted in the top 3 globally for JAVA (the language, not the island or coffee) Likewise the guy who build Google/Alphabet\u2019s global tax structure. These are examples of being experts. The other is to get the necessary skills to manage. Both are reasonable plans. Typically, a \u201cbroad\u201d approach is more resilient to changing economic and job-place circumstances. More transportable. Deep skills can contribute greater returns at a much lower \u201cTOTAL experience\u201d level, but the skills may be quickly superseded - VCR repair tech anyone?. Early on, you should have a variety of skills. As you move on, it\u2019s a good idea to develop a few of those at the expense of the others. It takes decades, not years, to be one of the best at some narrow skill. It takes a few years to get a good overview of a set of skills. That alone should set the pace of learning over your life. It isn\u2019t like you learn, then work and the learning is all done. Learning is a lifelong thing.",

From the moment Hiring Manager makes a decision on what he or she is looking for, they contact  HR department  and provide information on open position to  a recruiter,  whose job will be posting the job ad for the open position. (If the company decides to  outsource the recruitment , the process might take even longer). Recruiter might require additional information from the hiring manager and even interview the employees to understand who and what type of person, with which types of skills - they are  really  looking for. As soon as the job ad is up and running, depending on the job -  applications start to flow . There are some positions, where is tough competition (e.g. IT-specialists. Everyone is looking for one, and best ones are unavailable), so if the company is lucky and receives good applicants - the process can be  quite short , but if they are really looking for someone qualified - the process can take very long time,  even months . But most commonly, the entire process takes about 1.5 months. When the recruiter starts to  pick the best candidates , interview process begins. After the interview, the ones that that recruiter finds best to suit the company's needs,  hiring manager receives the information  on the candidates from the recruiter and either  interviews them  him or herself or  picks one or none  from based on what the recruiter says. Most often, it is the  hiring manager who makes the last call . Depending on these large companies, the way they recruit differs. Sometimes it is the hiring manager who is in charge or the entire process, sometimes they\u2019re not even involved. If you\u2019re applying for a job that  doesn\u2019t require many skills nor previous working experience , processes are fairly quick. What is the procedure to resign from software companies?

How long it takes to register a company? Having worked in a large organization, I've seen large scale recruiting take a long, long time. Often, we had to go to third-party staffing agencies to fill a lot of our positions. It's not ideal, but it's faster. We used different applicant tracking systems to help. We started with cBizsoft, but then they kind of went out of business, so we switched to RecruitBPM.  BPM Best Applicant Tracking System | Top Applicant Tracking Systems It depends on the company, the position, and the internal processes. From my experience, as a candidate it takes about 30 days to go through the hiring process if you\u2019re their top choice. However, on the employers side it can take anywhere from 30 days to 6 months depending on the urgency and talent pool. Andrew Crawford is right, there is no set time, it will vary based on time their culture and capability. There will be companies that hire based on 1 round of interviews and there are others that will only make a decision based on extensive rounds where any party with a vested interest has had their opportunity to review the candidates. Either way, take this as an opportunity to gain an insight into the company / department / team you are joining and whether it is the right fit for you.",

        "a": "Because basketball - and specifically the NBA - was so different in Chamberlain\u2019s time that it doesn\u2019t make any sense to compare him to contemporary players.  This is true both in terms of how the game was played, and who played it. We know from looking at shot attempts, rebounds, and estimates of turnovers  that the typical game in the early 1960s had about 1/3 more possessions than a game today.  So 40 points per game by Wilt Chamberlain suddenly become 30 points per game. 32\u201310\u201310 by Oscar Robertson is now 24\u20137.5\u20137.5. And so on. Impressive, but hardly out of today\u2019s players\u2019 leagues. Watching a game from that time puts everything in stark relief. Here is a typical possession: everyone jogs briskly to the other end of the floor. The players spread out, and most of them barely move over the course of the possession. Nothing more than token defense is played; there are no switches or traps, no fronting the post, nothing. The first time that someone gets even a little bit of space for a midrange jumper, he takes it. Since it\u2019s a bad shot, it misses, and someone gets the rebound. And so on. In 1961\u201362, the league-wide FG% was  42.6% . And yet the average points scored for a team was 118.8.  It was a totally different game. You know how else it was a totally different game? The desegregation of the American South either hadn\u2019t happened yet or was still taking time to bear fruit, so throughout most of Chamberlain\u2019s prime there was literally  one  Southern black player in the NBA (bonus points for naming him). There were also  no  players from overseas. Think that\u2019s not a big deal?  Here are some current players who, by virtue of where they were born or grew up, don\u2019t play in Chamberlain\u2019s NBA: Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, John Wall, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Rudy Gobert, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Paul Millsap, Nikola Jokic, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, DeAndre Jordan, Dirk Nowitzki, Vince Carter. Here are some retired players who have played since Chamberlain\u2019s time who wouldn\u2019t have played in Chamberlain\u2019s NBA: Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, Kevin Garnett, Charles Barkley, David Robinson, Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler, Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson, Dominique Wilkins, Yao Ming, Grant Hill, Dikembe Mutombo , and I\u2019m sure you can name many others. In my opinion, when we\u2019re talking about the best players of all time,  we should talk about the best of all time  since the ABA merger  and the best of all time  before the ABA merger  as two separate lists.  The difference between the two times was just too huge: the worst team today would beat any pre-merger champion easily, but those pre-merger players\u2019 accomplishments should be honored on their own terms. Basketball\u2019s pioneers were great and paved the way for what we have today, and there is no need to insult them by making strained comparisons to contemporary players who would clearly wax them. Can LeBron now be considered the GOAT? Do NBA players play pickup games for fun? Is there a basketball player who doesn't play basketball better than Michael Jordan? Or a basketball player we don't know about better than MJ... What does it feel like to play against an NBA player? What would Lebron James have to accomplish in his career to be considered the best bball player of all time, or is he already better than MJ w... A2A. I wouldn\u2019t say that Jordan is the undisputed GOAT. It\u2019s true that the great majority of basketball fans rank Jordan first. But some fans rank Wilt or Kareem first. It\u2019s a subjective decision, and Jordan, in his way, dominated just as much as Wilt did in his way. Having seen Wilt play in person over his whole career, as well as Jordan, I think I have the perspective to say this. Plus Jordan has the 6 titles and even outranks Wilt in scoring titles (10 to 7), total points, and ppg. I have Jordan first, Wilt 2nd, Kareem 3rd, Russell 4th and LeBron 5th. Jordan was the greatest clutch shooter I\u2019ve ever seen, even greater than Jerry West. But saying Wilt was a man playing with boys is untrue. Bill Russell and Nate Thurmond, among others, certainly were not boys. Because the NBA was much more competitive when Michael Jordan played and Wilt was the tallest player in the league whereas MJ was a shooting guard. Wilt Chamberlain was still one of the best players ever though because of his total dominance in the paint on both ends of the floor. Blocks weren\u2019t recorded, but from the footage and witnesses who saw him play, it is very likely that Chamberlain averaged 5+ blocks per game for his career. The same goes with the greatest Champion ever Bill Russell. However, there were 30 teams which means more talent and aggressiveness to compete against when Michael Jordan played compared to 10\u201315 over the course of Wilt\u2019s career. Plus, Michael Jordan won more Championships than Wilt and he was the best offensive player as well as on + off ball defender in the NBA. These are the main reasons why Michael Jordan is considered to be the undisputed Greatest of All-Time. Wilt Chamberlain (2x Champion) with all his natural talent and scoring prowess could not overcome the Bill Russel Celtics and win the NBA Championship (9 vs 1). Individual talent and accolades are nothing, if it does not translate to championships\u2026 Last year, the Warriors broke the NBA record for most game won in a season (73\u20139) but they did not win the NBA title, so they cannot boast that they are the greatest team ever. The 70\u201310 Bulls Championship team have that distinction as the NBA\u2019s greatest basketball team ever\u2026 Sometimes, even the great needs a stroke of luck to be considered great.  Michael Jordan  played in a tough era, where his contemporaries were just as good, producing many Hall-of-Fame players. The rules were different when Jordan had played, most notably the \u201chand-checking\u201d rule. This rule makes it easier for defender to guard their opponents yet M.J. still made fools out of them. Yes, Jordan did have great teammates and one of the greatest coach in history on his team. Jordan relentless competitive drive drove him to greater heights, and he wouldn\u2019t back down to anyone. It got to the point where his opponents feared him so Jordan had to give himself a challenge. Such challenges included shooting with his left hand and free throws with his eyes closed. To him, the game was much more than a game, it was to put players down while cementing himself as the greatest ever to play the game. That was his mentality and nobody can touch him. His accolades, awards, honors all speak in high regards for Jordan. On the other hand,  Wilt Chamberlain  had lesser competition. His skills were way above heads against his competition. It is said that Wilt was a freak of nature maybe even being stronger than  Shaquille O\u2019Neal . I did not watch much of Wilt but I assume that if you are \u201ca man against boys,\u201d your competition isn\u2019t as competitive as you are. Therefore, you are expected to be great and anything less is a failure. The way the game was played back then gave more opportunities to pad stats. And of course, Chamberlain, already being a unique specimen, had an easier time accumulating them. That unfortunately worked against him. Now, if Chamberlain absolutely dominated when the greatest era of big men thus far in the 90\u2019s ( O\u2019Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Alonzo Mourning, Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo ) then it would have rewritten history as to who the \u201cG.O.A.T\u201d is. Nothing to take away from Jordan, as I think he is as great as he is but a lot of it also has to do with marketing. Jordan does have a big deal with his own clothing and shoe company within  Nike . Therefore, the more they mention Jordan being the best ever, the more business they bring in. During Chamberlain days, you wore what the team provided, nothing more nothing less. That\u2019s not going to make anyone much business.",

        "a": "Without doubt, cheating is much worse than failure. Let me validate my reasoning with these points: Every failure, though humiliating, teaches a valuable lesson. That lesson, if learnt, can be the stepping stone for future\u200b success. Cheating merely postpones the humiliation of inevitable failure and deprives you of the opportunity\u200b to learn the lesson early. Lessons learnt from early failures are beneficial and guarantee success in the long run. Though cheating gives momentary success, it does not in anyway guarantee success in future attempts. It is important to remember that life will test you continuously\u200b. Irrespective of success or failure, the pleasure or satisfaction experience\u200bd lies in the hardwork you put in. If you cheat, no true effort or hardwork is put in and hence you will never get the mental satisfaction required to truly enjoy success. In hope my reasoning was clear and helpful. Thanks for reading. Peace. What is worse: regret or failure? Why did Nokia fail? Why do so many startups fail? Why did Symbian fail? What will make a married man cheat on his wife? Cheating is the same as lying and stealing.  Each time you hand in schoolwork, you are basically telling the teacher that you completed that work on your own. That\u2019s either true or, if you cheated on the work, it\u2019s lying. Cheating is also stealing because you are taking someone else\u2019s work and calling it your own. Cheating causes stress . When you cheat, you inevitably worry about getting caught. The stress of getting caught increases when you consider the possible consequences of your actions, such as getting in trouble at home or receiving disciplinary actions from the school. Even worse, you may have to develop a story to cover up your cheating, which can lead to getting trapped in a web of lies because it\u2019s so difficult to keep your story straight when it never happened. It can be very stressful if you get caught in a lie, or if you thinks someone knows about your cheating and might tell someone else. Cheating is unfair to others . Have you ever played a game by the rules only to have a friend who was so intent on winning that they cheated? Cheating is very frustrating when you are playing by the rules. When you cheat in school to get better grades, it\u2019s unfair to the kids who actually studied and did the work. You may also receive unfair recognition for the better grade, when it is not deserved. Cheating is unfair to you . Accomplishment feels good and helps build self-esteem and self-confidence. When you cheat, you are basically telling yourself that you do not believe in your own abilities. You might get an A on a test or an assignment, but you\u2019ll know that you really didn\u2019t earn it. Cheating just makes you feel bad about yourself. Cheating hampers progress . Learning tends to build on itself. You learn basics first so that you can use those basics in more complicated problems later. If you don\u2019t know the basics, then you will have to continue to cheat, or start over learning the material from scratch. Every time you cheat, you\u2019re not learning skills and lessons that could be important later on. Cheating is disrespectful . Teachers work hard to share knowledge to help you be successful in academics, career, and life. Cheating shows a lack of respect for the efforts of your teacher and your classmates who did the work. Cheating kills trust . It only takes getting caught cheating one time to ruin trust. Even if you never cheat again, those in authority will always have a hard time trusting you and will likely be suspicious of your work. When others hear about your cheating, their opinion of you will be compromised. Cheating can become a habit . People who cheat don\u2019t usually do it one time. It becomes a habit that follows people throughout college and into their careers. Just like gambling or stealing, cheating can become a part of who you are and spread into other areas of your life. Cheaters tend to lose perspective as to what is acceptable behavior and demonstrate a disregard for others. Cheating eventually leads to failure . By skipping the hard work involved in learning, you will never develop the important traits of persistence, dedication, diligence, and sacrifice. Success takes hard work, and cheating is the easy way out. Eventually, you will find that it is difficult to achieve your goals without these important skills. Cheating is embarrassing . Your actions define who you are to those around you. When you cheat, you are expressing yourself to others as lazy, incompetent, untrustworthy, selfish, unintelligent, and disrespectful. In addition, many schools are developing tougher stances on cheating. Imagine your embarrassment when you are suspended for cheating or you discover that school personnel informed college admissions officers of your actions. I would prefer even to fail with honor than win by cheating. Sophocles Read more at: - Sophocles Quotes Cheating. It is the most  disrespectful  thing you can do to the person you say you love. If you cheat someone who is willing to do anything for you, you actually cheated yourself out of true loyalty. Trust is like glass, once broken, it can\u2019t ever be mended again . Cheating on someone is deeper than what people realize. It destroys their outlook on love, future relationships and inner peace . So, if you love someone, don\u2019t cheat. If you want to cheat, set them free. Important is to delete negative words from the mind. One achieves the best what he or she thinks and so negative thinking is the culprit in the first place. Well no one is pleased to remember and bring such words but situation is the cause so it is better we analyze the reasons and it is sure one must have missed many opportunity for shear laziness or association of people and so on \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 We need to change the mind set and know that everyone is a unique creation and has some salient character which can make proud the world by the earnest and dedicated effort in the line which may not be the one being followed. We have to distinguish at every age that there is something essential according the demand of society which has to be tried to be fulfilled. Failing is never disheartening but an opportunity to revisit the cause and interest which can be life changing. Either we have missed for known reasons which need to be corrected or the reasons could be beyond our own control. More chances are available for any activity and shear dedication cracks the road. Cheating on the other side is a very inferior job. We think, have cheated other but in a long term but such person would become the victim in a long run when his / her life becomes either with more constrain or full of misery. This should be absolutely avoided, life is beautiful and fun but in the right way that we have to learn and experience the whole life.",

        "a": "Because it encourages inefficient and counter-productive behaviour by creating a negative feedback loop. Main focus of socialism is supporting the vulnerable members of the socium, which, definitely, is the humane and decent thing to do. However, that makes it beneficial for members of that socum to be vulnerable, weak and unproductive (let\u2019s call these people \u201crecepients\u201d), rather than strong, self-reliant and productive (let\u2019s call these people \u201cdonors\u201d). That is a natural instinctive process that cannot be consciously resisted - our brain functions in a way to optimise survival chances and thus is fixed on consuming minimal resources for maximum gain. The more socialist a society is, the more efficient from individual point of view it is to conserve resources, doing as little work as possible (ultimately, suffering as little as possible) and receiving as much support from the socium as possible. That is a biological fact of life that allowed humans to survive and prosper. Thus in time the socium becomes largely inefficient as members are rewarded for being Recepients and penalized for being Donors. As number of persons seeking social protection increases, it becomes increasingly demanding to stay in the \u201cDonor\u201d strata of society, which further encourages people to move to the \u201cRecepient\u201d strata. And the flow of people from Donors to Recepients increases. Again, this does not happen conscoiuosly or due to laziness or some decision by individual persons - it\u2019s a social process taking generations and often groups of people (families, social classes, subcultures etc.), not individual people. It influences work culture, social norms etc. And ultimately at some point of time - the Donors become too few in number to support the Recepients. At this point a catastrophe occurs - the rules of the game change in a fortnight to the opposite - suddenly it\u2019s no longer beneficient to be the Recepient as the support from Donors has ceased; the whole social structure collapses in flames and demands of social justice. This has happened many times in human history, even thousands of years before the word \u201csocialism\u201d was invented. Take literally ANY large and successful socium in human history - you will see that it reached a state akin to social utopia at one time close to its end and then a period of decadence and social collapse ensued, which ultimately led to the annihilation of that socium. Again, from historical point of view, it has to be noted that modern advances in technology have made very high labour efficiency possible, which allows for higher and higher ratio of Recepients to Donors. This allows socialism to prosper and endure for longer than ever before in human history. Today socialism essntially rules the world with only occasional collapses (like Venesuela). Maybe this time the technological advances could accelerate our labour efficiency faster than the social erosion degrades it and we would break the circle. We (or our children, maybe) will see. If socialism is so good, how come it never works? How does socialism work? Why do people say that capitalism works better than socialism? Can socialism work? Why does socialism not work? Due to authoritarian forces and lack of worker consciousness. The only instances of socialism that we have to look at are small and brief: Free Ukriane in the 1920s, Paris/French city communes of the 1870s, Spanish Anarchists in the 1930s. All of them were crushed by Authoritarian regimes. As societies, they functioned pretty well. HOWEVER, Humans existed in a \u201cproto-socialism\u201d for 150,000+ years, and still do so today in indigenous societies. So in one way, it is \u201cthe best system\u201d because it has been around longer than any other form of society from the Roman Empire to the French Republic. The question should be why hasn\u2019t socialism caught on with the working class in industrial countries? The answer to that is Kenyanism/social democracy/welfare states/government intervention/lenin/propagnada. Before this, workers rebelled and had numerous revolutions throughout the 1700s-1900s(in capitalist societies; peasants and slave rebelled long before that in other types of systems). Today its found in states that haven't provided the same kind of social welfare the west/asian tigers (ie universal healthcare, subsidized housing, food stamps, 5-day work week, weekends, 8-hour day, women rights, social security, public schools, paid vacation, paid maternity leave, public police, public fire department, safety standards in the work place etc) have. Socialism has worked, just not in the extreme fashion. In America, we have socialist policies, such as Social Security, Free Health Care, and/or services like Food Stamps. If you're thinking of the extreme version like Communism, it hasn't worked on one simple reasoning\u2026 Corruption. No matter what, at some point, people will reach the truth. Either some outsider tells them what's happening or their own realization. Corruption lays with power, if you give someone too much power, they'll abuse it. Take someone like Stalin for example, he was a paranoid man, promising a great future to Russia but killing many of his people. Of course, if you go with any gonvernment led society, you will always get corruption. Even America\u2019s great \u2018freedom of rights\u2019 have been infringed of from time to time. EVEN THOUGH COMMUNISM HAS NEVER WORKED. It does not mean it can't. And if it works it does not mean it\u2019s an evil that wants to destroy Democracy. It\u2019s just quite unfortunate that most of Communism desired in a place has turned out to be more of a dictatorship. Extreme levels of Socialism has not worked due to the power given to one person, they gain the ability to brain wash and make their people followers of horrible causes. Socialism and communism are great ideas in theory. The problem, however, is the execution. Socialism gives money and power to the government, and that's the problem. If you give money and power to someone, that someone tends to misuse the money and power. A great example would be Brazil. The last two presidencies took a left-wing approach to the country. Universities were cheaper, minimum wages were raised, and a welfare system was established. It worked, at first. Socialism always works at first. However, after a couple of years, the country was in trouble. It's spending was becoming too high. The currency inflated as more money was printed to pay off the debt. The economy was shrinking. Former President Lula da Silva was being investigated for corruption scandals, and former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached in part from her corruption allegations This is all a result of poor leadership, which came from increased money and power to the government. Most of the time, socialism does not succeed because of corruption. It is not inherently bad, but usually becomes so. However, there are plenty of examples where socialism has worked. Just look at Europe, where they have some of the highest standards of living, highest levels of income equality, highest levels of reported happiness, free universities, and universal healthcare. Not too bad if you ask me.",

        "a": "Based on Twitter trends, social media posts & other sentiment analysis - I can come up with the following 2 reasons: BJP IT cell -  Several Hindutva blogs, websites, influencers were praising the film - not for its story or the technique or the brilliant VFX or anything but for the overload of Hindu symbols, use of chaste Sanskritised language (this was the case for Hindi version), other Indian related symbolism carved out from Hindu traditions and cultures. It seems like the followers ( Bhakts , if you may) of the above blogs, websites are further propagating this nuisance which is going viral to some extent since a week. The National Media -  The Mumbai and Delhi centric English national media which generally assumes Bollywood to be the Indian cinema and lacks any bit of understanding of Telugu cinema or Tamil cinema or to be specific the cinematic world of SS Rajamouli - focused its analysis on the secular aspects of the film just to stir the pot and raise a controversy. This is hardly surprising to me as their reviewing, analysis fell short of any bit of technical analyses - on the story, visual techniques adopted, screenplay (which is a major draw for the movie as SS Rajamolui is a top 3 story-teller in the country) & the acting capabilities. Is Baahubali hype justified? The hype for Baahubali is quite real - the movie has beat its trade expectations by a mile and the critical expectations reasonably well. But no-one in the South has reviewed the film based on its Hindu related content or other such stuff. In fact we just see it as a Rajamouli epic, fantasy film and not as a film treading on Hindutva elements. It never crossed my mind at all. Dissecting the secular elements  - The Hindu elements shown are just natural as the story is set in medieval era (somewhere in the 10th century) and within the limited scope he has portrayed Aslam Khan (a weapons trader from Kabul) and Kalakeyas (seemed to be tribal lords worshiping the devil), Greek dancers in the Manohari song where clearly the cousins disguised themselves as Muslims (the surma was clearly visible), couple of other scenes in the second part as well. The story is set in a fictitious kingdom ruled by people who happened to follow Hinduism but he did make use of semi-real world elements when they talk about Greece, Persia, Kabul, the Muslim bazaar etc. In my opinion, yes the north Indian media and the Hindu-Hindi rhetoric bhakts are the culprits. PS: Let me the drop the biggest myth-buster of all -  SS Rajamouli  (director of the film)  is an atheist. What is your review of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017 movie)? What are the lessons learned from Baahubali 2? Should India be declared a Hindu country? Why? Why is there always a love story in Bollywood movies? Can they make some strategic movies so that youths can be motivated towards the nation r... How is Dangal a Muslim movie and Baahubali a Hindu movie? It is never a symbol of Hindu Nationalism Please see the movie as an entertainment medium its not an enlightment media! This movie has larger than life characters and setting and visually mind boggling. Great Direction, music, Cinematography, Good acting with some good VFX. Lakhs of people have worked for this movie. Now, I believe some national news papers and media houses started giving negative feed back to this movie making mockery of many things. The right wingers were pissed off at the way PK and many other Hindi movies show Hinduism in Derogatory way. This movie got a fuel to their anger as it collected more than any Khan's movies and was shattering Box office. Why these left wingers and Right wingers didn't talk about this movie when the first part released? the first part also had references to Hinduism. I believe, a film is just a piece of art. Every filmmaker has their own way of telling story and making movies. Don't judge movies based on religion or Ethnicity etc,. If you feel offended by some scene or portrayal of character, don't watch it. Other than that you cannot do anything. Problem comes with certain people who think they have an influence in decision making, so they start preaching their followers to either support some kind of movies or ban certain movies to fuel the fire. Unfortunately, this is bigger in Bollywood and media houses. This is not a problem in South India When has it become a symbol of Hindu nationalism? In which world are you living? Neither that movie nor any of its characters has got any significance among Hindus. I along with many of my friends watched the movie. Believe me non of us felt anything other than being entertained. Gods, angels and prophets are referred in all movies across the world. So do you consider every movie religious? The movie  Bhoolbhulaiya  had two songs: Hare ram hare ram & Allah Hafiz. So should that movie be a Hindu nationalist movie or an Islamic movie? I just have one question to you so called liberals and seculars: Should there be no reference/dialog or connection to Hinduism in any movie?",

Such a link had been suspected even before that, but no conclusive studies had been done. Hitler was a smoker, but apparently quit, at least to a large degree. He was deeply concerned with the health of the German population (I hope the irony of this escapes no one), so the connection between smoking and cancer made tobacco products the enemy in his mind. Germany became the first country ban smoking in many public venues and a centralized public campaign denouncing smoking as decadent behavior was pursued for a few years. The emphasis wasn\u2019t on quitting though it seems but to simply smoke  less . Soldiers were just issued fewer cigarettes, not no cigarettes. Even so, the rate of tobacco consumption seems to have actually gone  up  in Germany prior to the war.  This was likely due to the German economy coming back on its feet allowing people to afford cigarettes again. What are some positive things we can learn from Adolf Hitler? What is the most badass thing about Adolf Hitler? Where is Hitler's body? Where did he die? What are some facts about Hitler? What was Adolf Hitler's view on China? The German autobahn. The idea was touted in the 1920s but progress was slow due to the economic downturn and lack of political leadership. When Hitler came to power he put it on his agenda, to help create jobs etc..  Autobahn - Wikipedia  This government economic plan to initiate growth through infrastructure projects is still being used by nations today. Hitler also pushed for a universal car for every German family to own and use on this autobahn. You might have heard of it? Its called the VW Beetle designed by Porsche. Although there has been suggestions he copied it off a Czech design. Hitler was ahead of his time, as already noted in establishing the autobahn in Germany. That led to the US copying it in the Interstate System. The Volkswagen was also an important innovation, but that concept of a people's car had already been implemented in the US by Henry Ford with the Model T automobile.  Hitler made some important contributions to how politics is conducted today. He was the first to use aircraft to rapidly move from one campaign event to another while running for the chancellorship of Germany in 1932. He was the first to use synchronized broadcasts of political speeches on the radio. His use of radio ads was revolutionary, as was his use of radio to communicate to the German people on a regular basis. FDR, arguably, followed up on this idea with his fireside chats, but Hitler was a big pioneer in this area. Hitler was revolutionary in using movies to project his message like 'Triumph of the Will\" with Leni Reifenstahl. His use of mass rallies was revolutionary. We can argue that mass political campaigning today comes from Hitler. In 1937 Hitler created Volkswagen. Volkswagen means \u201cpeople's car\" and it was created so that the German population could afford to buy cars that weren't expensive and were easy to purchase. Since 1937 Volkswagen has benefited people a lot since people are always buying them. During the 1940s and 50s Volkswagen helped a lot of people and even today Volkswagen is the largest auto-maker in the world. References: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...

Caroline Lucas is an anomaly - she is seen by many for more than just her political credentials, there's something about her as a person (she seems unlike most politicians) and is clearly a hard working and good person. Importantly - more than just Green voters support her. I for one am a Labour voter and was not a supporter of the local green council but I will vote for Caroline Lucas above any other candidate as a voice like hers is valuable in Westminster. I think most residents in Btn Pavilion feel the same. I could be wrong though\u2026. The Greens are not standing in Brighton Kemptown and the Liberal Democrats aren't in Brighton Pavilion. Is this limiting of public choice good... I heard that Brighton is no longer as progressive and liberal. Is this true? Is Hooters in Brighton UK now open? Have people from outside of the UK heard of Brighton? Is Brighton or Bristol the best choice for a weekend break? Yes. Overwhelmingly so. She increased her vote share by over 10% points from 2010 to 2015 - assuming she hasn\u2019t done anything to anger local residents - she should likely keep her seat and percentage of the vote quite comfortably. She is a popular MP who has (in my opinion) stood up for her constituency and voted in a way they support (Brexit particularly important). The Greens certainly don\u2019t think she\u2019ll lose her seat, there have been calls to campaign in Bristol West and Isle of Wight but not Brighton Pavilion. It should be noted that Electoral Calculus predicts a Conservative gain from Green [1]  but notes that Brighton Pavilion ranks 650 for Leave (out of 650 seats). This assumes general trends of a Conservative swing across groups are uniform. Footnotes [1]  Seat Details As the son of a councillor on Brighton & Hove City Council, I have a fairly rare insight into the chances of Caroline getting re-elected. The Green Party\u2019s local councillors have an atmosphere of confidence that not only will she be re-elected, but that she will increase her percentage of the vote compared to the last general election. This confidence is mirrored by the polls and the slightly less scientific method, of prediction, that is counting the number of Green posters in windows. I will be completely shocked if Caroline doesn\u2019t get re-elected this year, as will her many loyal followers in the city.",

What is this I'm feeling? Is this a normal crush or normal nothing? Is it normal to feel sad because you are single? Yes it is. In fact, many people WANT to be in a state that you\u2019re in right now. You don\u2019t need a companion to make your life feel better or more fulfilled, you enjoy your own company. Rather than looking for love from others, You seem to look inwards and know how to be happy with yourself. So to answer your question, if you\u2019re feeling fine being single, you\u2019re not normal, you\u2019re AWESOME! :) Normal?  It's more than normal. It's fantastic. If you have the ability to be happy without depending upon another person, nothing can beat it. Single should never equate to lonely. Nothing compares to basking in your own company. If you must fall, fall for yourself first. So, being single and feeling fine with it is the best gift you can give yourself. P.S.:  You're just as sane as I am. :P Being single is equally good as being married or dating someone. Being single is another beautiful world. People think you are alone but in actual you are not alone ever the reason you are connected with god very well. You are more spiritual person in life than others. In other words, i want to say that being single is not bad at all. Everything is right if you think positive.",

Given the background is China (but I have emmigrated out to Canada since then), land of surging opportunities this is my analysis: Some of these bottom tier kids (academically) have special talents in art. They performed poorly in regular schools but they can succeed with their skill. Universities are mostly research institutions, not the best fit for some people eh? The society is a more important school. Top students are perfectly educated with theories and doctrines. They have strong credential but not adequate social skills or social network. The elite frustration. Top students can be facing constant pressure to stay on top of everything. Some of them don\u2019t handle failures well. Success is earned after failures. The elite students have too much to lose, their life can be very restricted. Many of these elite students focus on Finance, accounting, law etc. making them perfect fit for highly paid professional jobs. They still do not own a business in the industries.

It is true that Indian women want the freedom that the westerners do have. But then again, who doesn't? With regard to Indian women wanting zero responsibilities, that we treat college like adult daycare and that we marry guys who have stable jobs and sit at home once it becomes feasible - I may not be able to speak for everyone but I'll speak for the women who are similar to me. An average Indian millennial woman  [1]  works a corporate job to ensure that she can stand on her own two feet. Marriage or no marriage, living with her parents or without her parents - every woman has responsibilities. We don't shirk from it, though at points we wish we could but that's just wishful thinking. A lot of us go on to pursue our Masters with the main intention that we would like to climb the same corporate ladder that the men we marry would. There is a whole lot of us out there who are \u201cambitchous\u201d and refuse to let marriage be the option to sit back and relax. Not because we don't trust our man\u2019s capability but because we are sure of ours. We also know that the present economy is not conducive for living on one person's income. Technology has come to our aid and has helped us balance that \u201cwork-life\u201d jazz a bit better than decades ago. A lot of us women have become entrepreneurs by leaving our cozy corporate job. Don't let that fool you, being an entrepreneur is HARD WORK! We do this out of a passion to serve our community and for those of us who are risk averse, we prefer the corporate culture and working under that banner till retirement do us apart. Footnotes [1]  https://www.pwc.com/sg/en/divers... Are there any Indian women out there who dropped out of school? What are some cases/stories where some women have misused the Indian laws that were made to protect women? Do Indian women actually like being asked out? Do Indian women prefer to work in MNCs these days? What scares Indian women? Hi Vijay I have some problems with the way this question is formed. Being a financially independent woman who chose to not have an easy life in her father\u2019s well set up nursing home, i derive inspiration from women around me. so when you say: \u201cIs it true that Indian women want all freedoms of western women but zero responsibilities, they treat college like adult daycare and marry only those guys who have stable jobs and sit at home once it becomes economically feasible The modern Indian woman is beautiful, intelligent, and independent. She speaks her mind, follows her heart and gives a damn to those who remind her of the glass ceiling. The best part is that she is also fighting for her individuality, Striking a work-life balance was an ideal state of life for a woman till a few years ago, it\u2019s not now. No we don\u2019t treat college like daycare, we study we slog and there is a girl topping UPSC every passing year. We don\u2019t marry the one\u2019s having stable jobs, we have better reasons to marry. We don\u2019t sit at home because of leisure, we have our little ones to take care of and we don\u2019t want to miss that. We are breaking free from stereotypes that define us from male point of view. We are everywhere, all set to write our own rules. Meet the new Indian woman, who has finally arrived with Saree and sneakers and we aren\u2019t dropping out. We are here to stay. Love P It seems to be a trend to project women as victims and sob creatures while discussing any topics. There has been no decline in the farming occupation of women. Rather due to the insensitive attitude of the system, there have been farmers\u2019 suicides (husbands\u2019 lives lost) There has been no decline in women's participation in most fields and ages, excepting during the pregnancy periods which is a medical requirement. In fact the defence forces too employs women now. I won't go by the BBC article actually, since no authentic sources have been quoted. By simply giving links to the homepage of organisations doesn't mean that any data has been quoted. It is in fact a frivolous exercise. More children, women and men have been brutalised due to the wars and natural disasters. Indian women have been actively engaged in various professions since ages. It is ingrained in us. The pretext of the article trivialises marriage and pregnancy and pits it against office work. Instead if the article gave a solution as to how two working people (husband and wife) can alone manage pregnancy, child upbringing, etc without any outside support, I would have appreciated. There are numerous reasons for women to leave workforce in India 1.After marriage some women aren't allowed to continue their career due to ultra conservative in-laws and husband. 2. Some women after marriage are unable to cope up with work pressure, as they are not able to balance both work and home so they quit. 3.Pregnancy and child birth is one of the reason for many women to quit their job as women can't imagine a life without kids in India.Women is considered incomplete, called by various names if she prioritise work before kids. 4. Some women have to face sexual harassment at work, so they prefer to quit than fight it out. 5.There exists corporate glass ceiling where women rarely reach the top position, that acts as demotivation for them to leave career. 6. Women are never taken seriously at work specially in India due to patriarchy.",

        "a": "Business analysts are wildly used in not only in consulting, PE, VC and controlling departments but more and more in marketing and growth teams. The exact mix of skill that are the best fit obviously depends on the industry and area but some seem universal. Business analysts are responsible for evaluating multiple options before helping a team settle on a solution. While discovering the problem to be solved, business analysts must listen to stakeholder needs but also critically consider those needs and ask probing questions until the real need is surfaced and understood. This is what makes critical thinking and evaluation skills important for new business analyst. Business analysts use a variety of techniques to analyse the problem and the solution. As a new BA, you might find that you naturally see gaps that others gloss over and identify the downstream impact of a change or new solution. As you mature as a BA, you\u2019ll use a variety of techniques to conduct analysis and deconstruct the problem or solution. Examples include use cases, business process models, and decision models. In this skill area, we see many cases where professionals have related experience in analysing problems using different techniques. Your experience is transferable and can be expanded by applying some of the BA techniques in your current work. How technical do business analyst need to be? What skills do you need to be a business analyst? What do I need to know when transitioning from a developer to a business analyst role in an IT firm? What do I need to know as an investment analyst? What are specific technical skills of Business Analyst? I think it is less what you need to know, and more about your aptitude, creativity, and willingness to learn. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions, brainstorm, or transpose your experience from other activities into your work. I think business analyst is a fine balance between the business knowledge and business potential. What I mean is that too many times I have seen BAs either resist change, or embrace too much change. In my experience, the best BAs have think both in, and out of the box.",

However, cos 90 = \u22120.448 073 616\u2026 cos 180 = \u22120.598 460 069\u2026 Therefore, cos 90 > cos 180. By the way, standard mathematical convention is that without angular units explicitly indicated, radians are to be assumed. The numbers 90 and 180 have values that make it seem like degrees were intended, but since there was no \u00b0 symbol, I must assume randians (or, equivalently, dimensionless real number). Can I write Cos(-40) as -Cos(40)? Why does the value of cos 90 equal 0? Why is the tangent of theta greater than 1 but neither sin nor cos can be greater than 1? How can I find cos/sin/tan 180? What is cos alpha? If one is familiar with the unit circle then they know that as you travel around it, the x coordinate you are at represents the cosine of that value. Here is an image of the unit circle when we have travelled 90 degrees around. Notice how the coordinate of the black point on the circle is (0, 1). Thus the cosine of 90 degrees is 0. Similarly, here is an image of the unit circle when we have travelled 180 degrees around. Notice again how there is large black dot on the circle. This time it is at the coordinate (-1, 0). Thus the cosine of 180 degrees is -1. Since  [math]cos(90) = 0[/math]  and  [math]cos(180) = -1[/math]  we therefore can say that  [math]cos(180) < cos(90)[/math] . Let\u2019s see. [math]cos90 = 0[/math] [math]cos180 = -1[/math] Thus, cos90 > cos180 I must say that before asking this question you should have studied some basic trigonometry:/ Because anyone knowing a basic trigonometry can do this.

Yes, a signed written agreement (contract) may be revised (\u2018amended\u2019 is the proper word to use) \u2014  with the mutual consent of all parties to the contract . Amendments cannot be made unilaterally. Every signed agreement can not only be revised (with all parties agreement), but should be looked at from time to time to see if it is still relevant. If the parties are not around, there may be people who have taken over their roles. In England, a few years ago (1215), we had a signed agreement called the Magna Carta (OK, technically sealed, not signed, but you know what I mean). Over the years, one by one, most of the terms have been revised. However there are a few left (such as trial by Jury). Thus the terms in it have been regularly reviewed and revised. Having said that, the town where I live desperately needs a third bridge, but rule 23 of the Magna Carta means we can no longer force people to build one. Shame. Yes.

This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The block chain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. Bitcoin nodes use the  block chain  to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere. Bitcoin mining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady. Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by other Bitcoin nodes each time they receive a block. Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function. The primary purpose of mining is to allow Bitcoin nodes to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus. Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce Bitcoins into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a \"subsidy\" of newly created coins. This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating people to provide security for the system. How to mine ? First you need to buy hardware (Antminers) which will cost you more than 1100 USD and after that you have to shell around a dollar each day for electricity. Doesn\u2019t look feasible. You have an alternate , cloud based bitcoin mining. There are mining companies who are having their own mining farms location around the globe in countries like Iceland , China . They are have thousands of antminers working together and produce huge hashrates. Now they offer these hashrates for users. You can buy hashrates from them. There are lifetime contracts / 1 year contract.But Beware , cloud mining area is having lots of scam websites which never pays. So only buy contracts from reputed companies .

Adding cream around the scab can be extremely helpful in preventing the itching and pain of wound contraction. If it\u2019s an especially large wound, or if you have the sort of job or lifestyle that would contribute to increased infection, use antibiotic creams. These are readily available at all pharmacies. If the wound is small, well healed, or you are willing to check it to ensure infection isn\u2019t setting in, use baby oil, or even a good quality skin cream to help keep the area from drying out. What should I put on a healing wound to soften a hard dry crust formed on top so that I can remove it? Does removing the scabs off a healing wound speed the healing process? Does honey help in wound healing and why? Is it normal to have fever after gun wounds? How long does it take for a bullet wound to heal? Heres what you need to do. . . . Absolutely nothing.

Today\u2019s version of HANA is much much mature and allows so many revolutionary applications like S4HANA, UI5, FIORI and more to run on it. Data modeling is so much simpler than SAP BW. A lot of clients are moving and that is due to the success stories in the past few years. The future is bright for the ever evolving SAP HANA database. To learn SAP HANA data modeling, try this easy to understand website:  Realtime & Easy SAP HANA Tutorials for beginners - 100% Free Why is SAP HANA not picking up the market as expected? How much do SAP HANA solution architects make? How does Gartner evaluate SAP HANA? What is the market share for SAP HANA hardware vendors? How many companies are using SAP HANA? Hi, Currently there are requirements for both ABAP as well as HANA. But considering the market trend, it will be an excellent idea to learn HANA. SAP is slowly moving all the components to HANA and ERP, CRM etc are already done. Learning HANA will give you extra edge. Companies who use SAP functional tools are plugging in HANA. As a result, demands for HANA jobs are growing. Popular names of companies using SAP HANA are Asian Paints, Mercedes-AMG, Vodafone, EMC, eBay, Colgate Palmolive, Coca-cola, Accenture, Sandisk, Unilever, Lenovo, Infosys, Cisco and many more. Now, these companies need HANA experts. The most popular jobs related to HANA are SAP HANA Cloud Experts, SAP HANA Modeler , SAP HANA Consultant and SAP HANA DB Admin. As the demand is more and comparatively number of good hana resources is very less, the payscale of a SAP HANA expert is 15-40% more than an average IT Salary. And, some companies even consider for niche skill bonus for the HANA experts. FinallyI wan say Market will be always competitive but you can stand and beat the market and technology based on hardwork, people never encourage and never say market is good. I can see today also people are getting job in sap Hana, if your dedication strong if you are hardwork don't bother about market and competition. Thanks Sap hana is doing pretty well in the market. It has received an excellent rating from analysts for its in-memory computing engine (IMCE) on huge volumes of data and deploy real-world projects. It offers an advanced relational database product with high-performance analytic system, HANA. SAP's Startup Focus program provides startup companies that use SAP HANA technology with business and technical resources. In the present time, SAP HANA can be used widely in multiple use cases including big data processing and implementing business warehousing processes. Since this BI framework uses advanced tools for in-depth analysis of present, past and future data, it is prominent among modern-day business executives to predict future analytics and let them take improved decisions for better performance. SAP, the biggest maker of applications used by companies to manage processes from manufacturing to marketing, is pitching customers on an over hauled version of its core management software, S/4 Hana, whose functions can run in their data centers or SAP\u2019s. It\u2019s very likely that HANA will continue to dominate SAP\u2019s fiscal 2Q16 results as SAP\u2019s cloud strategy, which previously used to revolve around SAP HANA, is transferred to S/4 HANA. SAP HANA is competitive in its market. In fact, we should expect see a big jump in its market share growth soon. SAP recently released its newest version of enterprise solutions in the form of SAP HANA. The previous version called SAP Business Suite (also known as R/3), was a suite of different applications such as ERP, CRM, PLM, ect which could run on other companies' databases. However, SAP HANA has integrated all these application into one all-encompassing software that has been specifically designed to run off of SAP HANA. Being available to multiple databases limited SAP's Business Suite to the performance standards of the lowest common denominator database. SAP HANA is central to SAP\u2019s entire product strategy. Two of the most recent SAP technologies based on SAP HANA are SAP S/4HANA, the successor to SAP\u2019s flagship SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC) 6.0 business suite, and SAP HANA Cloud Platform, SAP\u2019s platform as a service. As the business benefits, adoption paths, and product roadmaps become clearer for SAP S/4HANA and SAP HANA Cloud Platform, we\u2019ll see a substantial uptick in customers not only investing in the technologies, but actively using them. Many organizations are looking to hear more from both their peers and SAP about how and when to make the move to an SAP HANA-centric world.

        "a": "Well, the JEE ADVANCED 2017 paper was slightly easier than the previous 2 year papers. Definitely the cutoff is going to be high. The paper pattern was similar to the last year\u2019s paper so it wasn\u2019t a surprise for the students as they had practiced mocked papers with the similar pattern. It was slightly tougher then the 2014 ADVANCED paper but not much though. Being a dropper I think I can answer your question. Here is the marks vs ranks list of the paper 2014 As per the coaching institutes in India the cut-off would be around 35% and would not fall much like it happened last year. 2016 Data(Approx) Marks VS Rank 215 \u2014\u2014\u2014 350 180\u2014\u2014\u2014 1100 170\u2014\u2014\u2014 1600 150\u2014\u2014\u2014 3000 145\u2014\u2014\u20143500 135\u2014\u2014\u20144500 133\u2014\u2014\u20145200 2017 advanced paper was intermediate between 2014 and 2016 paper As per my experience of two years and after reading the review of the paper by different coaching institutes this could be the possible marks vs rank data: Rank Vs Marks (Expected 2017, I have also verified the data with some of the rank predictors) 1- 320+ 10\u2013310 50\u2013290 100\u2013280 500\u2013250 1000\u2013220 2500\u2013200 5000\u2013180 7000- 165 8000- 155 10000\u2013140 This is approximate data but I\u2019m sure that it would not deviate much. Best of luck Cheers!!! What rank can I expect with 349/366 marks in JEE Advanced 2017? What rank can I expect with 225/366 marks in the JEE Advanced 2017? I am getting 180/366 in JEE Advanced 2017. What rank can I expect? What rank can I expect with 191 marks in the JEE Advanced 2017? What rank can I expect with ~290/366 marks in JEE Advanced 2017? The JEE Advanced 2017 paper can be best described as a  slippery slope  - no subject was equally difficult on both papers, and nothing was a giveaway on either. Chemistry P1 was harder than in P2, Phy P2 than P1, etc. If you\u2019ve messed up Phy P1, you\u2019d have a hard time recovering in P2. In spite of the questions being a tad easier than in JEE 2016, the marking scheme gave no respite. To wit, the overall difficulty was probably  at par  with JEE 2014, but with +4/-2 being a common theme in either paper, it was like playing  minesweeper . To estimate the expected marks v/s rank, let us get an overall feel for the paper. The number of difficult questions was reduced by ~20% : AIR 100 should sit at ~280 (76%). The cut-off should increase by ~10%. Chemistry was overthrown from being the easiest paper. The number of moderately difficult questions went up by ~25% : we should not see clumps around the 2k-3k mark. The tricky grading scheme would lead to high density for scores around ~120\u2013135. Here is my analysis of the marks vs rank distribution. Edit  : For people who are confused about FIITJEE/Reso/CP predictions online. Let\u2019s do an assertion-reason practice. St I : The projected ranks v/s marks are deflated by coaching institutes.  St II : Some of the one-year courses offered by them begin before 12th June. I'm trying very hard to be politically correct here. First of all congratulations to all of you, as u were a part of one of the toughest examination. There is a lot of confusion, and it should be (obviously) regarding the marks vs rank stats as many are saying exam was easy, some saying moderate. I want to ask them a ques, if the exam was easy, why even now the prestigious coaching institutes are not consistent with their answer keys, why they are giving answers like AB or ABD. Why the answer key of two coachings not matching with each other. Even if the exam was easy, I think the cutoff will be low only. Lemme just state the reasons- Everyone was considering JEE mains paper to be easy, then why the cutoff goes the lowest in comparison of the previous year's. The condition is I think same as of the last time, last time rank predictors were stating 4k rank at 50%, and what the result goes u all know. Paper seems to be easy because people were expecting it to be extraordinary tough. Previous year stats:- Acc to me this year also the cutoff will be low- 60% marks-top 500 50% marks - top 1200 40% marks- top 4000 35% marks- top 6500 30% marks- top 9000 22% marks- top 10500 This is only my guess by seeing the last year stats and the jee aspirants qualities. Don't take it to be too serious. Keep your fingers crossed guys and hope for the best. Since I wrote JEE Advanced this year, so I think I am eligible to answer this. This year, the  Paper 1 pattern was changed a bit  having Linked Matching Type Questions, which gave a sigh of relief.

This year will witness some very surprising selections in IIT. One of my friends got 118 marks in JEE Mains and he is getting 198 in JEE Adv 2017. I myself got just a centum or 100 marks in JEE Mains and am scoring around 130 marks. That\u2019s a huge difference. Let\u2019s wait until the results are out on 11 June because IITs remain the boss here. Everything else is a mere prediction. Best of luck to me and to you too :-) Edit:  Please do not trust rank predictors especially the one by FIITJEE as they are totally irrelevant. They were the ones who predicted JEE Mains \u201917 cutoff to be 115 which hurt me a lot. So keep calm. Peace.",

Why does the current always remain the same in a series circuit? If the frequency of the EMF source in an AC circuit is F, the power varies with what frequency? Why can\u2019t we put a current source in a series with a voltage source in a circuit? What are linear and non-linear circuits? I think your definition of Linear networks is not usual! Because linear circuits contains capacitors and inductors too along with resistors. And the output of the circuit changes with the change in input source type. For example, the circuit behave differently with a sine wave voltage and differently with a square wave input and differently with pure DC. A time-independent elements is one for which we can plot an i/v curve. The current is only a function of the voltage, it does not depend on the rate of change of the voltage. We can see that capacitors and inductors are not time-independent elements. Time-independent elements are often called resistive elements. Note that we often have a time dependent signal applied to time independent elements. This is fine, we only need to analyze the circuit characteristics at each instance in time. Linearity A function f is linear if for any two inputs x1 and x2 f(x1+x2)=f(x1)+f(x2) Resistive circuits are linear. That is if we take the set {xi} as the inputs to a circuit and f({xi}) as the response of the circuit, then the above linear relationship holds. The response may be for example the voltage at any node of the circuit or the current through any element. Any Linear circuit has its own characteristics and the response of it for given input would be fixed. The circuit won\u2019t behave differently only the response would depend purely on the nature of input.",

        "a": "I don\u2019t think it is right to say 250 years. I think the US has been dangerously bellicose only since WWII. Prior to that, America\u2019s predisposition was to avoid foreign entanglements. We got dragged to WWI in the last year, and we stayed out of WWII until we were attacked on our own land. Can you imagine the US staying clear of such conflicts if they were happening today? But now? Yes, the US is programmed for endless wars. Here\u2019s a great article on the subject from  Foreign Policy . \u201cForeign-policy thinking in Washington is dominated either by neoconservatives (who openly proclaim the need to export \u201cliberty\u201d and never met a war they didn\u2019t like) or by \u201cliberal interventionists\u201d who are just as enthusiastic about using military power to solve problems, provided they can engineer some sort of multilateral cover for it.\u201d In short, we\u2019ve got a standing army and navy that is not content to defend the continental US and is eager for aggressive overseas war; diplomats whose careers hinge on making their little corner of the world (looking at you, Yemen!) seem vital to US interests; weapons manufacturers wooing congresspeople with promises of jobs and campaign contributions; and a population that stupidly accepts the notion that any death in uniform is heroic and desirable. I prefer the model of the late Indiana congressman Andy Jacobs, Jr, who was a Korean War veteran. He said,  \u201cI support making violent, vindictive war when it is necessary. But not whenever the opportunity arises. War should not be an economic policy or a jobs policy.\u201d Who would win in a war between Russia and the US? What would happen if N. Korea followed up on its threat and launched a nuclear strike against the US? How would the US respond (2013\u201317)? Why did the United States lose the Vietnam War? What is it like to grow up in a war zone? How did US jingoism lead to the Spanish-American War? I don't know about the last 250 years, over the last 500, it looks to me like the most warlike cultures are U.K., Spain, Russian Federation and France. As for the US most of the wars they've been involved in we're in conjunction with other participants. The 2 biggest conflicts in Hisyory had multiple combatants, WW1 and WW2, and they weren't the country that started the conflagrations. They joined later, and only after being attacked or threatened. So of America in its 250 years has developed a \u201c\"warlike culture\u201d imagine how \u201cwarlike\u201d those other cultures must be. Graph from Our World in Data https://ourworldindata.org/war-a... I\u2019m curious to know what this \u2018aggressive war culture\u2019 might be? As opposed to what other culture? European? Since 1767 France fought more wars both globally and colonial than the US ever dreamed of. England too. The various states of Germany fought revolutions and petty wars until unification and then helped launch not just one but TWO world wars. The same for Italy, who not only initiated the Balkan wars by attacking and seizing Libya from the Ottomans, but then proceeded to fight on both sides of the two World Wars. Tzarist Russia, revolutionary Russia and the Bolshevik USSR conducted war after war with abandon throughout their existence in those 250 years. Even now, supposedly \u2018democratic\u2019 Russia has conducted no less than four separate wars or conflicts in just the last two decades - Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine, Syria - with a forceful occupation of Crimea thrown in. Africa? In constant turmoil both during the colonial and post-colonial war. When not at war they conducted genocide just for fun - Rwanda, Congo, etc. South and central America? Every nation there revolted against Spain and then opened wars among themselves, with some lasting multiple decades (El Salvador, Argentina, Guatamala). China? Just as contentious in their own way - from the Imperial court to Sun Yat Zen, to the Nationalists to the Communists - steeped in blood across two and a half centuries with far more casualties inflicted and suffered than the US ever dreamed of (Taiping revolt, Boxer revolt, Warlord years, Sino-Japanese War, Communist revolt, Korea, Tibet, Vietnam in \u201879, etc.). India? Both as part of the British Empire and after independence - war, war, war. Several times with Pakistan, against China, Bangladesh, Kashmir, etc.) The Middle East? Please, don\u2019t get me started. I\u2019m reminded of a Frenchman who despairing of the cost and frequency of war after 1918 in Europe decided to find a secluded island in the Pacific on which to retire in peace and security - somewhere no one had ever heard of with no appreciable natural resources or anything that anyone would want. Surely he\u2019d be safe from any war, right? He chose the island of Guadacanal. History has taught that Empires, one of which is the USA today in a broad meaning of the term, even longer lived ones like the Roman Empire which lasted 500+ plus years, the Bysantine after it with 1000+ plus years and the Ottoman and British Empires, used a mix of military power, aggressive diplomacy and economic pressure to maintain their status. The \u201cculture\u201d of war thus was always present, as was the ability to project military power when the carrot, or gun boat diplomacy failed. The Romans did it with their legions, the British with the Royal Navy, the US do it with their powerful military, which can swiftly be deployed abroad, as well as with permanent presence in all regions of interest and their powerful carrier battle groups. The difference today is that \u201cproxy wars\u201d are preferred to full involvement, which are cheaper in manpower and easier to stomach for the public opinion. In any case, if the US want to keep that leading role in world affairs, they will have to keep nourishing that war culture, since in the future sooner or later, their position as the world's leading power will be questioned. It has always been so, Empires rise and fall and the status of the US as the undisputed contemporary superpower in the world for the latest decades is measured as a single breath in time compared with the Empires which preceeded them. Aggressive war culture? Interesting. Was not aware that the US sought conflict outside our borders in WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam or any of the wars since. In each case, our national interests were attacked directly or via surrogates of authoritarian regimes. Our War for Independence was the result of the mother country refusing democratic representation in Parliament. That\u2019s not aggression. War with the Barbary Pirates. The US Navy and USMC went abroad to wipe out sea-going terrorists and pirates and guarantee free passage of the seas. War of 1812 was a reaction to our rights of free passage on the open sea being violated AND overt support of Indian wars in our country. Aggression? Not so much. Mexican War? Absolutely. Pure imperial overreach. Hubris of the day, seizing largely empty territory to make it our own. Civil War? 30 years of compromise to end slavery went nowhere. The Union reacted to the Confederacy threatening the dis-Union of the country. Spanish-American War? More like a police action to stabilize Cuba\u2014unquestionably an imperial action. In most instances. America\u2019s wars have been fought to protect ourselves from other, weaker, authoritarian states for whom deterrence is not enough.",

One TPU is claimed to deliver  up to  180 Teraflops, while one pod is claimed to deliver  up to  11.5 Petaflops. Since one pod has 64 TPU\u2019s in it, a simple bit of math tells you where they\u2019re getting this max performance number from: 180 Tflop * 64 computers = 11,520 Tflop This is a pretty much useless calculation. I would bet that anyone who has a decent amount of experience in high-performance computing will tell you that computing power of a parallel system doesn\u2019t scale like that. I can\u2019t tell you what the actual performance of the system you\u2019ve suggested is, but, given the math I\u2019ve demonstrated, the numbers that Google has given here don\u2019t seem to be very realistic. Since machine learning is such a buzzword, I would bet that this page is more targeted to executives and non-tech or semi-tech people who have the money to invest. Simple mistakes like this are a massive red flag to anyone who works in the industry. I hope that helps! How Many X...?: How many supercomputers are there in the world? Why do nearly all supercomputers run Linux? How fast could the world's fastest supercomputer brute force crack a password? Why hasn't the US come up with the worlds fastest supercomputer for a few years? Do you believe the world is made of 1's and 0's? No, because TPU doesn\u2019t run Linpack. (You might be able to run a drastically hacked version, but it certainly wouldn\u2019t operate at the rated flops, which is, after all, entirely designed for NN.) It\u2019s common to criticize Top500 for being archaic, but in its defense, Linpack does honestly model a lot of computational codes. It\u2019s not even a bad model for NN, except that Top500 is DP and NN seems to really want the lowest possible precision\u2026 In general, there\u2019s no replacement for scale. GPUs, for instance, are effective accelerators for a small fraction of the kinds of jobs that run on a Top500 machine, but basically useless for the rest. Arguably, the same applies to the increasing vector acceleration built into standard CPUs: great for some codes, but of no benefit to others. (Obviously, GPUs are a form of vector processor - if you lengthened and Intel AVX-512 core to 2048, you\u2019d have something similar to a GP100 SM.) So the best, fastest, most flexible compute resources in the world will always be big clusters. Not without a different network interconnect. Even then, it might not due to various I/O bottlenecks that might be found.",

It may send an email to your address and ask you to visit a link in the email, to prove you gave a good address. Next time you visit, the site asks for your password. It then checks to make sure that\u2019s the same one you used to register with. If it is, it lets you access the site. It creates a session cookie (a random string of characters) which it gives to your browser. Each time you visit a new page, your browser returns the cookie, which is like getting a hand stamp at a show to prove you\u2019ve paid. If you stop visiting the site for a while, the website forgets the session cookie (so does your browser), and says you will have to login again and give your password again. Often, your browser can remember your password for you, but if you use that feature you should make a \u201cmaster password\u201d to encrypt all the stored passwords, in case someone steals your laptop. Because websites can be hacked, and website operators may not be honest, passwords are obscured as David says. The website does not remember the actual password, it remembers a hash. You can get the same hash from the same password every time, but you can\u2019t go backwards and get the password from the hash. How did old game passwords work? I forgot my Facebook password and email password. How can I log into Facebook? Does Facebook know my password? How do I get my Skype pass back if I forgot it? How does the OTP (one time password) work? When a password is set / stored, a mathematical equation is done on the characters of your password (using a \u2018salt', please lookup password salt for more info), This is called a hash. This hash value is then stored. Any change in the password or salt will result in a different hash. When you enter a password, the same mathematical equation is performed on the password you enter. If the result matches what is stored, you are granted access. If it does not, your password attempt is rejected / denied. I hope this helps, I'm no cryptography expert Can some explain it like I'm 5 years old that how passwords works? Alice: Can I visit your treehouse? Bob: What\u2019s the password? Alice: I don\u2019t know, let me in. Bob: What\u2019s the password? Alice: I forgot the password, I knew it, I really did. Bob: What\u2019s the name of your pet? Alice: Fluffy. Bob: *passes Alice a note with some instructions on how to make a new password*. *** time *** passes *** Alice: I\u2019m back, I\u2019ve made a new password. Bob: What\u2019s the password? Alice: hunter2 Bob: Get off my lawn. The *simple* answer is that usually the system stores your password. When you attempt to log in you are asked for a user name which the system uses to identify and know the correct stored password. Then the system asks for your password. The system compares your password to your stored password. If they match you are in, if not then you are rejected. There are other things that go on to make it hard to know a password even the if the database of stored passwords are stolen. There are also processes to recover lost password. But that would complicate. I talk in terms of system because most applications use some operating system service for password instead of re-inventing (which is usually done without good security), but it works the same. Password works when the password stored in database matched the one you keyed into the application\u2019s password field. When password is keyed in, (normally) there would be validation in application where password keyed in would be checked against the one stored in database, and if it was not a match, then application would return an error statement.",

        "a": "I don\u2019t think we know directly from unethical experimentation, though someone has probably performed it. Most likely, we know that it will take only matter of days for a human to die without water because we can observe how fast people get dehydrated and previous fatalities. Many people get sent to the hospital every year because of dehydration due to heat, diarrhea, vomiting, disease, and other reasons ( How long can the average person survive without water? ). From those patients alone, I\u2019m assuming that we can put a good estimate on how long it took them to get dehydrated and the symptoms that would\u2019ve resulted had they not been treated. We also know from a biological standpoint that the body \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d be able to survive for long without water. It varies depending on the temperature and activity level of the individual, but I wouldn\u2019t be willing to put that to a direct human test. How long can a human survive without water? How many days can an ant survive in water? How do some people survive without water for over three days? How long can a possum survive without water? How many days can a human being stay alive without water and food? Likely that has happened to people that have suffered from severe dehydration, then scientists record it. Or, some people go without water for one day, then scientists will take on how the body is doing, then set a proportion to see how well it will do until the body dies. That\u2019s just my thinking here. Park rangers in desert parks (and others too) see this every shift: you\u2019d be surprised how many people wander off for a jaunt without water, or take just enough for a few hours and get lost for a few days.

However n history it seems to be a mixed bag. TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR 3 ENGLAND 2, 1961 CHARITY SHIELD Despite being billed as an 'FA XI', Tottenham's opponents in the 1961 Charity Shield was undoubtedly the England team of that time (minus  Spurs ' England internationals), managed by England boss Walter Winterbottom. Spurs had won the double that year, the first time since the Charity Shield was inaugurated in 1908 that this feat had been achieved, leading to England's participation in the event (the practice of inviting the league runners up to take part in such an event first occurred in 1986). Spurs beat an England team containing the likes of  Bobby Charlton ,  Bobby Robson  and Johnny Haynes in an entertaining game at White Hart Lane. Bradford City  2 ENGLAND 1, 1986 This match was held to mark the re-opening of Bradford City's Valley Parade ground in December 1986, over a year after a tragic fire in the main stand had killed 56 people who had simply gone to watch a game of football. A quarter of a century after he'd played for England against Spurs, a crowd of 15,000 were present to see Bobby Robson manage England to a 2-1 defeat against the Bantams. AYLESBURY UNITED 0 ENGLAND 7, 1988 England went into the 1988 European Championships hopeful, as ever, of glory. How did they warm up for the challenge of Jack Charlton's tough Irish side, the Dutch team of  Ruud Gullit  and Marco van Basten and the powerful Soviets? With a friendly against Beazer Homes League team Aylesbury United. Peter Beardsley scored four as England unsurprisingly cruised to victory, a feeling that would elude them in West Germany when they lost all three games to crash out of the Euros. ARSENAL 2 FRANCE 0, 1989 On Valentine's Day 1989  Arsenal  took on a France team looking to acclimatise to the British style of play before they faced Scotland in a crucial World Cup qualifier. Arsenal's Scottish manager  George Graham  was criticised by national team boss Andy Roxburgh for agreeing to the fixture, but it didn't help the French, who lost out on a place at the 1990 World Cup to the Scots. Meanwhile, Arsenal (who went on to be crowned champions that season) beat France 2-0 thanks to goals from  Alan Smith  and Martin Hayes. The French team contained a certain  Eric Cantona  and the Arsenal fans serenaded their team with a rendtion of 'Arsenal for England!' ARSENAL 3-2 AUSTRALIA, 1984 The win against France wasn't the first time Arsenal had beaten international opposition at Higbury. Five years previously the  Gunners  beat Australia in a November friendly, in which John Kosmina (at Arsenal between 1978 and 1979) lined up against his old team for the Socceroos. Arsenal's 3-2 win was revenge for a 3-1 defeat they had suffered to Australia in Sydney back in 1977, with George Armstrong grabbing the Gunners' consolation. BARCELONA 2 BRAZIL 2, 1999 This incredible contest took place at the Nou Camp as part of Barcelona's centenary celebrations. Ronaldo put Brazil ahead on his return to Barca (he was an Inter player by this point, but had yet to sign for  Real Madrid !) before Barca equalised. Barcelona's  Rivaldo  put Brazil 2-1 up by half-time (he was playing for his country), but the Catalans levelled things when Brazilian Sonny Anderson (who couldn't break into his national side) got the game's final goal. Who will win the UEFA Euro Cup in 2016 and why? Who has a better standard as a team in soccer, a top club team or a top national team? How would a top MLS team fare in the EPL? Which team will win the 2018 World Cup? Are Premier League clubs better than La Liga clubs? (all the teams excluding the top 4 from each league) Very difficult to answer as the question is open ended ,It will certainly depend on 'n' number of other factors. Do they get same number of training days before the actual match day ?. It so happens that for instance Barcelona players would have played many matches together as a team,so the understanding between teamates would be far greater than Germany (read national teams)national team ( the time spent in training as team is far less). In short football is a team game and not an individual sport, which is a huge deciding factor for final outcome of the game. By this assumption Barcelona will have a upper hand. A team like Barcelona has best of the best players from all over the world in all the positions. For Germany (read national teams)certainly the players are some of the best in the world but again in some positions it might not have the best players. PS- Names of Barcelona and Germany are used for illustration and both cannot be coMpared in anyway. it depend on which top flight club team. if the top flight club team are like real mardrid , barcelona, PSG, etc, which got many money and spend lot of bucks for signing player, they are likely win the reason are, while the top flight national team had to take the best tallent from  one  country, the club will take the best tallent from  any  country the club will bought player and more likely, ask this new player do adapt to the club\u2019s playing ways. and the national team is the opposite. as player, just rely solely on national team wont gave you much. they don\u2019t pay you high wages. its your club. You play and train few times with them, much more with club result, you\u2019ll get adapted more with your club rather than national teams but if the top flight club team are the likes of atletico madrid, as monaco, etc which doesn\u2019t have much budget, then the chance are 50:50. the club cant always bought the player they wanted. this lower their chance to win The top flight club team is surely the favourites to win. Because the players have been playing together training and together since a long time and they have a good understanding among themselves. They play around 50\u201360 or more matches in a whole season Whereas in National level u might play only 10 matches in a whole year including qualifiers and friendlies. So definitely the club has better chances of winning. I bet mid league placer in top league, like Atalantamor current AC Milan, can win against Germany, provided the player mutually exclusive. ;) In club live, practice takes whole weekdays, and played on weekend, so, we train 60 % time together. In national team, not so much, normally only about half a month at best, before big cups. :) So, while national teams blessed with quality (Barcelona fan spare me, please), they are not blessed with team cohesion, means, National team forced to use the simplest form of tactics, and ;) We can see how devastated a national team is when it simple tactic countered, Brazil by Germany, Spain by Netherland, etc. There a way though, that is, to use many player from one team in national team, so they can do the usual.

        "a": "Because Indian army is fooling you, and that\u2019s why Pakistani army want to show the world once again how miserable Indian army is. Why war with Pakistan\u200a\u2014\u200ais not an option Raghu Raman  : Major Dinesh Raghu Raman was an Indian military officer with the 19th Battalion of the Jat Regiment. In the 1983 film WarGames, a nuclear war simulation is accidentally started by a supercomputer designed to take over in event of the cold war spiralling out of control. After evaluating all the possibilities, the computer declares that \u201cwar is a strange game, in which the only winning move \u2013 is not to play\u201d. That advice is possibly truest for India right now. For all the xenophobic war mongering touted in every medium, India cannot \u2018win\u2019 a war against Pakistan and the sooner we appreciate this politico-military reality, the more coherent and serious we will sound to our adversaries and the world community. The demands for a \u2018once and for all\u2019 resolution of Kashmir/Pakistan emanating from several quarters, which surprisingly includes some veterans \u2013 equating India\u2019s non-retaliation with impotence \u2013 perhaps don\u2019t factor the larger picture and the stark truth of modern military warfare. Matter of fact, short of total genocide, no country regardless of its war-withal can hope to achieve a decisive victory with a \u2018short war\u2019 in today\u2019s world. As the US is discovering eight years, trillion dollars and over 25,000 casualties later - in Afghanistan. That era of \u201cdecisive\u201d short wars \u2013 especially in context of an Indo-Pak war is largely over because of several reasons. Firstly \u2013 the much vaunted Indian military superiority is largely an accounting subterfuge. Sure we have more soldiers, tanks, aircrafts and ships than Pakistan, but banking on mere numbers is misleading and irrelevant in military strategy. Pakistan has successfully locked down over 30% of our Army in internal counter insurgency roles that not only sucks in combat troops from their primary roles for prolonged periods, but also alienates the local population in the valley. The major reason of the Pakistani Op Gibraltar\u2019s failure in 1965, was the overwhelming loyalty of Kashmiri locals towards India. Disguised Pakistani troops who had infiltrated into the valley to incite rebellions were caught by the locals and promptly handed over to the Indian security forces. 50 years later, sentiment in the valley is very different. And this \u2018turning move\u2019 has been achieved by Pakistan with a ridiculously low investment of merely a few hundred terrorists and psychological operations. Another substantial part of our Army is locked down in the North East insurgency and we are still trying to build adequate force levels against our much stronger adversary all along our border with China. India\u2019s Chinese front is in a tenuous state because of decades of neglect and the massive infrastructure China has built to be able to mobilise several divisions in a matter of hours into that theatre. Most worryingly, Pakistan and China have achieved military interoperability - which is the capability of their two armies to execute joint missions against a common target. Decades of mutual cooperation, technology transfer, training, equipment sales and of course a common enemy - have welded our two adversaries into a formidable joint force. Pakistan\u2019s accelerated achievements in nuclear technology, missile delivery systems, logistic supply chain of equipment and spares as well as new-age technologies such as cyber and drone warfare are all the result of cooperation between the two countries. In contrast, India has not even been able to integrate its three services, what to speak of assimilation with political leadership, industry, academia and indigenous defence capabilities. As Praveen Sahwney points out in his book \u201cThe Dragon on our doorsteps\u201d - India has primarily focused on developing its military arsenal whereas Pakistan and China have been developing war waging capabilities - which is a synthesis of many strengths other than just military force. Secondly, Pakistan has leveraged their geopolitical position far more strategically than India has been able to. India has traditionally relied on moral high ground to achieve global consensus and support. In the aftermath of the Cold War, the world\u2019s largest democracy, wedged in between a communist adversary and a rapidly radicalising Islamic nation got global mindshare and sympathy. Though none of that translated into meaningful benefits for India per se, our foreign policy continues to have the hangover of \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d. Unfortunately, in the harsh reality of the contemporary world that doesn\u2019t count for much. Russia-our traditional all weather friend has far greater bonhomie with both the US and China than ever before. The US needs Pakistan to achieve closure in Afghanistan so much so, that despite the blatant betrayal of shielding America\u2019s public enemy number one - Osama bin Laden, the US has no choice but to continue supporting Pakistan financially and militarily. On the other hand Pakistan\u2019s dependence on the US has reduced dramatically with China filling in the gap. China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt One Road\u201d project coursing through the length of Pakistan has pretty much made the two permanent partners. China\u2019s economic aspirations and access to the Arabian Sea through Baluchistan ending at Gwadar port is a strategic masterstroke by Pakistan and China. Not only is it a win-win for them but it is also a \u2018lose-lose\u2019 for India for many reasons. Firstly, the only area where India could try a meaningful riposte to Pakistan sponsored insurgency would be Baluchistan. By tying in China\u2019s stake of keeping Baluchistan under control, Pakistan has made it extraordinarily difficult for India to make any aggressive move in its south without threatening Chinese interests. The same is true for any Indian military action in the theatres of Kashmir or Punjab. Any Indian operation which endangers thousands of Chinese citizens working on the CPEC project in Pakistan will draw the wrath of China and give them the loco standi to initiate hostilities against India. So beyond shallow skirmishes all along the border, India really has no operational or strategic options without the risk of drawing China into a two-front war. Pakistan has correctly appreciated that the force levels which India will be able to muster against it will be more or less evenly matched, and in the event of Indo \u2013 Pak hostilities, they can depend on China for their logistics supply chain as well as splitting the Indian Armed Forces\u2019 resources and focus by mobilising PLA divisions along the border with India. This would in effect, pin down a substantial part of the Indian Army\u2019s reserves to cater for the Eastern front. Also, now there too many stakeholders dependent on the success of the \u201cOne Belt One Road\u201d/CPEC project and any disturbance in this area would be attributed to India\u2019s truculence rather than Pakistan\u2019s interference into Kashmir. China combine has positioned the OPOR as an Asian developmental initiative, whereas the Kashmir problem has been positioned as a bilateral local issue - by none other than India itself. So, rather than looking like the visionary big player in the Asian growth story, India is at the risk of being perceived as the obdurate party incapable of setting aside bilateral issues for the larger good of the region. And with dark clouds hovering over their own respective challenges, none of the world\u2019s major powers - US, UK, Russia or France will have the gumption to interfere militarily in an Indo-Pak conflict that has the potential to draw in the fifth permanent member of the UN Security Council. Politically too, India is in no position to consider a short war. The current political dispensation is only just gathering momentum on its electoral manifestoes, the linchpin of which is economic development. That necessitates a stable and peaceful environment. War clouds are an antithesis for economic investments. Even preparation for war costs billions of dollars in terms of resources and mindshare, a diversion that India can scarcely afford when millions of youth are entering the job market whose un-channelised energies is another potential risk. For a nation to go to war, all its pillars of strength, including its military, economic prowess, industrial capability, external alliances and national will must be aligned in a singular direction to achieve meaningful success. War waging is not about bombastic threats, surgical strikes, cross-border firing or clamorous bellowing on TV channels. That is called letting off steam. There is an old couplet by Ramdhari Dinkar which suggests that forgiveness befits a snake which has venom in its bite - not one which is weak, toothless and harmless. To be taken seriously, India needs to build that strength first rather than spewing ineffectual rhetoric. Why war with Pakistan\u200a\u2014\u200ais not an option \u2013 Raghu Raman \u2013 Medium Can India defeat China in a full-fledged war? Can Pakistan win a single war against India? How was Israel able to win every single war with its Arab neighbors? Why is Sania Mirza playing for India even after her marriage to a Pakistani? What does the Indian Army do when it is not fighting a war? OK everyone around here knows very well that indian army won all the wars isn't it And here's the twist in all of Pakistan history is presented is so much distorted way that they actually believe India was badly defeated Pakistan was based on two nation theory by which Muslim and Hindus can't live together so evidently from beginning itself they hated Hinduism and india You must be well aware that civil authority make policy and run the country but that is somewhere not close to reality for pak For decades it's been driven by terrorist like Hafiz saeed ,saeed saluddin and many more And even getting the backing from China now earlier from us made them strong and easily harbour it's land for terrorism And I'm not joking really pak army runs the country And Im not joking if you promise pak of Kashmir you would win their election as they only think of Kashmir nothing else all this has contributed for pak to become terror exporter and hate India and war mongering even after defeat",

The term, successful, could mean that deliverables are turned in on time or that the business need is met. Developing an effective plan involves identifying and outlining all the key tasks that must be completed within the allotted time. With a detailed plan, key stakeholders are able to see the estimated amount of time needed to complete the analysis effort. In some cases, the Business Analyst may use this plan as a basis of negotiation for more resources on the project. The Business Analyst is responsible for creating the plan but is expected to seek input from key project team members like the Project Manager, SMEs and the technical team (in cases where technical expertise is required to judge the feasibility of requirements) to determine how work will be carried out. Very often Business Analysts are placed on a project without getting much input or say in how the Business Analysis aspects of the project will be implemented. This is often due to the fact that there isn\u2019t much awareness within the organization around formal Business Analysis planning activities. It is mostly assumed that the Project Manager should be doing all planning including the Business Analysis aspects of the projects.

Strict  fines. I mean it, this really bit Joss Wheddon in the ass when he was doing  Buffy the Vampire Slayer . That Toriyama doesn\u2019t monkey around. Yes, of course it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re the writer, you can do anything you feel like doing. That\u2019s the point. When writing fiction, should I use \"okay\" or \"ok\"? If you could write a letter to any fictional character, what would you write? Do you fill out fictional character profiles, or do you simply write? How do I write fiction faster? As a writer producing a work of fiction, do you tend to know the ending when you start, or do you find out as you write? A friend of mine, who is an avid reader and also reviews books on her blog, enjoys thrillers. She always says \u201cthere\u2019s nothing like a good baddy.\u201d In other words, the person has redeeming qualities. Usually a reader will recognize this over time. Life isn\u2019t black and white. It has lots of gray areas \u2014 so why shouldn\u2019t a villain character turn into a hero. Villains becoming heroes is one of the oldest tropes known to man. Literally \u2014 it happened in the  Epic of Gilgamesh , and that dates back to at least the 18th century BC. What I\u2019m saying is, it\u2019s a great plot if done right. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been around so long. Hero is a little strong, but in  Trial By Fate: The Virgin Whore Trial  Mr. Choi, the villain gains some measure of redemption by telling Holly, the lawyer investigating the case, the truth about what really happened. This is about 15 years after the instigating situation. Why it works is that Choi is set up as an amoral, ambitious fellow, he still has his MacBeth moments and a conscience. The great villains of film and novels are usually quite complex and tortured. It\u2019s a very important role, and I\u2019m awfully proud of Choi. Absolutely. And as if there's not enough Potterheads in Quora to remind you, I give you two words: Severus Snape Some might say that he's not a villain, but if just read Philosopher's Stone, he's pretty much assumed as a villain by many, who thinks he'll do nasty things in the future.",

        "a": "Answer:  Definitely YES. 10 years ago, I would love to get such a clear answer from a peer ;) If you love Finance and technology, and you have a strong entrepreneurship sense, Fintech is probably the best career you can embrace nowadays as it merges Finance, tech and taste to fix problems (entrepreneurship). Actually, the Finance sector is reshaping by talented guys with finance and computer science backgrounds, because they genuinely offer to the society the best value of finance. As you may know, the financial crisis of 2008 has been a tsunami for most of us, as we figured out that finance and the banking sector was to some extent broken. Fintechers started to use technology to offer transparency, speed, trust, collaboration, and accessibility to people and to make Finance great again! Fintech is great, It's true, believe me! haha ;) After my high school, I studied Finance mainly because of curiosity. Indeed, I felt lost as I didn't understand how our modern society works and wanted to understand the financial and economic system. I would not be honest if I don't tell you that I was also fascinated by Gordon Gekko and all the Wall-Street culture!!! After being graduated in Finance from a business school, I started my career in investment Banking ( debt and project Finance). Then, because, I wanted to understand from inside the financial market, I moved to the trading floor. I was what we call, a Hedger, a kind of trader who is responsible for covering the different financial risks of big corporates, from commodity to currencies, and debts. I really enjoyed these jobs as it was intellectually challenging and quite satisfying in term of salary. But during these years, I observed many changes in my daily work. From trading with phones to automatic platforms, my job was changing at a really fast pace. I figured out that technology was rethinking my job and redesigning my skills. So? I quit, and joined a Fintech company! Yes, I didn't want to be simply replaced by a computer, but I wanted to be part of this evolution/revolution. From then on I started to learn coding and user experience design. After months of learning, practice and sharing with smart guys, I decided to Co-found a new Fintech Startup, because I found out a problem to solve. We start  izi - Your Stock Investment Assistant To sum-up, I don't think you can learn Fintech, as it is pretty much a mindset to experience, but you should definitely learn computer science and Finance. But because you need to know where to start, and because we have only 24 h in a day, I should advise starting your major, firstly in computer science and then get some competencies in Finance. Yes, computer science is the fuel of Fintech as Fintech companies, startups need guys, developers to build stuff. Developers are the architect of Fintech! To get skills and competencies in Finance, you should get internships in different fintech startups to find what you love the much in finance. Eventually, to fulfil your entrepreneur sense, you can start, on the side, a simple project, and you will get the taste of entrepreneurship and the love to fix problems ;) I should tell you as well to participate in  Startup Weekend - Learn, Network, Startup  to feel the vibes and the pleasure of entrepreneurship. I hope my answer will help you to find your own way and get success and happiness in your future :) All the best, young fintecher !!! What is a good overview of fintech? How good is a fintech course in India from SP Jain? What's the best laptop I can buy as a CS student? What is a good minor for a marketing major? Is every Biology major student good at math? Just like you, I love technology, love finance, love entrepreneurship , and therefore love Fintech! I've had the chance to do all of them (CEO of tech startup, Managing Director in banks, started a few companies), and the question is : where do you start? I don't think many universities offer a fintech major (I helped designed the first lectures at Oxford and a Fintech programme at Imperial College, and at that time we were amongst the first for lectures , but no major) so I think you'd need to start either with a tech or finance major. I think both are fine. If you happen to like both, I'd start with coding / programming and follow lectures in finance. Good luck, and do great things in Fintech! Especially startup land won\u2019t be too concerned about your major. I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s so day one in Fintech that Universities are the last place I\u2019d go right now. Depending on your financial situation, go volunteering for the coolest fintech you can find in your area and you will be fine. That\u2019s where the action is :)",

Wealth - Wikipedia  is defined in some dictionaries as \u201cabundance of valuable resources or valuable material possessions\u201d. Those include assets that can be sold or traded. Human capital is a special case because it can be used to obtain employment, but cannot be sold itself. Some human capital like legal or medical training is highly dependent upon a specific position in a specific society. Also, certain attributes like relative health or freedom from extreme disability or some basic education valued in a stable community are needed to reliably utilize assets. I think net worth is the best indicator of wealth for healthy people with a good education. There is a tendency to confuse income and assets in recent years I have seen unfortunate.

But that is the core problem with Narcissists: it is  never  their fault; thus listening to other, less enlightened people is a waste of time to them. So, if you could convince him to listen to the smart people around him \u2026 that would mean that he is able to listen to  your  advice. But he wouldn\u2019t be in the position he finds himself now if he would be able to listen to other people. Catch 22 here. That is what makes such people so shiny on the outside; and so incompetent on everything when you are stupid enough to put them into a position where actions matter; not words. Is Trump planning to impose Martial Law on the US to keep power? What are the chances of Donald Trump's impeachment? Does Trump\u2019s immigration ban affect US green card holders, US dual citizens, and dual citizens of other countries? What does Trump keep in his pockets? How does Trump plan to keep America great? If the goal is to keep Trump in power, here are some ways to achieve it: Accept everything Trump says or tweets as gospel truth, and ignore all evidence to the contrary. Assume that what happens in Washington is none of your business, and that the elected politicians can sort it out on their own. Hey, if we elected them, they must be honest and competent, right? Don\u2019t bother to vote, unless you\u2019re voting for the incumbent. Repeat any malicious gossip you hear about Trump\u2019s competitors or adversaries. Trust Trump to tell you which media outlets are telling you the truth, and which are just \u201cfake news.\u201d Assume that the rich and powerful are the best judges of how to run our economy, our society, and our government. After all, they must be pretty smart or they wouldn\u2019t be rich and powerful, right? Put all your effort into the Bernie vs Hillary debate, and ignore what\u2019s going on with the Republicans. Assume that, if Trump is doing anything unconstitutional or shady, his fellow Republicans will call him out on it. Be willing to accept any candidate, no matter how shady or crass or incompetent, just so long as it isn\u2019t \u201cHillary.\u201d Assume that FOX News is fair and balanced because they\u2019ve said so, and trust them to tell you how to feel about Trump and his administration. Take the position that keeping Trump in power is the most important goal, even if it means having to change or circumvent the Constitution in order to achieve it. An interesting question which I suggests requires a review of the strategic decisions Trump has made to become president. Remember: Trump claimed he could shoot someone on fifth avenue and his supporters would still stick with him: Donald Trump could 'shoot somebody and not lose voters' This has import on the answer to the question. At no point in this election cycle has Trump had support of a majority of the electorate as a whole, either of Republicans in the primaries or the overall electorate in the general. In the primary Trump made the strategic decision that he could win the nomination with a plurality of Republican voters. He was proven correct. Leading up to the general election Trump made the strategic decision that a majority of Republican voters would join forces with him giving him a chance in the general. Trump was proven correct. In the general election Trump made the strategic decision that if he could appeal to the right plurality of voters, he could win in the electoral college. Trump was proven correct. When Trump became president it appears that he made the strategic decision that if he were elected, the majority of the country would support him. In this he was incorrect. Instead of correcting course to address this potential weakness, Trump made the strategic decision that, given the US governmental structure, he actually only needs support of a plurality of congress to stay in office. So far it looks like Trump so far is correct. And following from his comment about shooting someone on fifth avenue,Trump appears to have made the strategic decision that so long as he has a adequate minority of strong Trump supporters, he can remain in office no matter what he does. As your question points out, this decision is now in doubt. At this point Trump is not in a position to call upon the good will of others: he burned those bridges as a minimum during the first 100 days of his presidency. At this point Trump is not in a position to stop the investigation. Given the complexity of Trump\u2019s career, one can say with confidence that as a minimum there are embarrassing if not shady skeletons in Trump\u2019s closet. And because of Trump\u2019s strategic decisions, he now pretty much has to ride it out. So what can you as a citizen do: you can be a strong member of the hard core supporters Trump is depending on. If (and I will now use hypotheticals): Trump is found to be an explicit agent of the Russian, you must continue to support him Trump is found to have explicitly traded the powers of his office for personal gain, you must continue to support him Trump is found to have explicitly attempted to thwart the investigation, you must continue to support him Trump is fond to have grossly and intentionally defrauded his investors, you must continue to support him Because from the beginning Trump has depended on this minority of hard core supporters who will stick with him no matter what to drive his success. And if you and other of Trump\u2019s base desert him, he will fall in a New York minute. So perhaps the question is, how much malfeasance are you as a hard core Trump supporter willing to swallow? Because at this point that is what keeps Trump in the presidency. That would be impossible since the man is unstable and delusional and will continue to be his own worst enemy. Just look at the long list of outrageous things he has done in only four months! He can\u2019t be controlled, he\u2019s a train wreck. Look at the mess he put himself in with the Comey situation. Hopefully this will get him impeached and he will be out once and for all. The people who voted for him did not do their home work or are total idiots. Trump is unscrupulous, bigoted, a crook and doesn\u2019t respect women. he thinks all Mexicans are rapist and murderers! Wow what a gem we got in the white house! Encourage your Republican representative to stick with Trump and do what\u2019s right (for Trump). Tell the Republican politician that (s)he will lose your vote if they abandon him. Attend Trump\u2019s rallies, so he can still feel that he has support.

        "a": "Your question is totally irrelevant as Pakistan is the country who earns only by selling/renting out there own country to other developed countries. Previously Pakistan did this with US and now doing with China. But, in actual countries don\u2019t function this way. I can only say, Pak government has made Pak citizens of day dreaming and nothing else. Anyone from developed world will not have asked this question, but i can understand your case. So, here are few points why it\u2019s not possible: US & China can never go against India because it\u2019s biggest market for both the countries and a manufacturing hub too. Even thinking to attack India will mean attacking there own economy. US & China are lot much matured countries and believe in resolving issues bi-laterally and have done that too in past. There is slight exception with China as they have communist government, still they have much good relations with India. US \u2192 Indians have 80% CEO\u2019s. 65% strength in administration, 30% strength in Army, 20% in Courts :) and many other important intellectuals in US and number is countless. Do you really think now, US can do that. Don\u2019t forget IT sector, Aerospace sector and many more. Manufacturing \u2192 Indians have huge manufacturing units in China & US, attacking India means kicking these units out of there countries. If you read international news, then just read what happened to UK when Tata Steel planned to sell out its plant there. :) Export \u2192 We are biggest suppliers of generic drugs in world, we are one of the biggest exporters of cars in world, we are biggest exporters of tractors in world, we are biggest exporters of spices in world, we are hub of medical tourism and count is endless. Do you still think, US & China will go with illiterate and confused Pakistan. :) and yes don\u2019t forget (which Pakistani\u2019s are rarely aware of) IT it covers almost entire US including defense, aviation, army, administration etc and China is also at same stage. Agro Products \u2192 We are one of the biggest suppliers of agro products to world. If they attack us, they will have less to eat. Aviation \u2192 We are important suppliers of helicopters to these countries and yes don\u2019t forget ISRO, US is biggest customer of US. I can go on the whole day with the list but these are more than enough to answer your questions. See that\u2019s what i tell to all Pakistani\u2019s and would love to suggest you here again. Your government is taking their citizens in wrong direction. They never talk about development, instead just talk about Kashmir and other framed issues. I would suggest, look into your self Pakistan is victim of his own wrong doings and no other neighbor go to do with this. Pakistan separated from India as per your own will. Now, go and rock the world why are you coming back to India and are becoming pain for India and your country too. My words are harsh but this is what the reality is. Leave terrorism(be it good or bad), Work only for development that is the only way out. If a country declared a war against India, would the USA help India? Can India defeat China in a full-fledged war? Who would win the war! If China, India, Russia, and their allies joined together in an alliance against the U.S and its allies? Why? China and Pakistan have proposed to India to join the CPEC. Should India join this project? Who would win in a war between India and China? Why? The only country that is currently interested in dismantling India is Pakistan. China does make noises and has concerns about India\u2019s growth potential because it sees the country as a definite future rival, but it will never want to invade and annihilate India because they wouldn\u2019t want to lose a market of 1.25 billion people. As for the US, a rising India is great news because they desperately need powerful allies to counter an increasingly assertive and aggressive China. So although theoretically it sounds like music to a Pakistani\u2019s ears, it isn\u2019t going to happen. However, the reverse is definitely possible. Despite China investing heavily in Pakistan and coming to the country\u2019s aid against India at every possible forum, Pakistani support to the Uyghur militants is causing concerns and the Chinese are beginning to be increasingly vocal about it. As for the US, it has tolerated Pakistani shenanigans for a long time but even they are fed up of Pakistani deceit. American efforts to stabilize Afghanistan have always come to nought because of Pakistani perfidy, Osama was hiding barely 5 miles from the Kakul Military Academy yet Pakistan denied they knew where he was. No wonder the US didn\u2019t trust Pakistan and eliminated Osama on their own. So if India does attack Pakistan, which is a highly unlikely event, the US and China will definitely oppose it, but won\u2019t physically intervene to prevent Pakistan\u2019s defeat. I couldn't help but laugh at this question! Why the hell will the US join hands with Pakistan and China to even think of waging a war with India? Not even China is thinking of war with India and I'm sure even Pakistan is not. US considers China as a rival, they don't trust Pakistan. Trust is very delicate issue here. US neither does China have any interest in waging a war against India. Do you know why? Because economic interests holds precedence. China has heavily invested in Indian economy so has USA. These two counties have a lot of trade and benefits with us than go to war over frivolous reasons. Grow up, understand there's lots going on in the world today. War among major powers isn't one of them.",

At the time of Independence nearly 72 per cent of population was dependent on agriculture. Even today, about 49 percent of the total employment is in agriculture and allied sector (Economic survey 2013-14). Although there has been an increase in the absolute number of people engaged in agriculture and allied activities since Independence, but of late, as per Census 2011, there has been a decline in the absolute number of cultivators, which is unprecedented from around 127 million in 2001 to around 119 million in 2011. This is indicative of a shift from farm to non-farm employment.

        "a": "For anger management, no tricks of management works. It is more the issue of deep within layers called chittah. You can chant the mantras of five elements and nature (which are part of your actual personality) You can say, Om Lam Namaha - Earth Element Matnra Om Vam Namaha - Water Om Ramm Namaha - Fire Om Yamm Namaha - Air Om Hamm Namaha - Space Om Prakriti Namaha ( Nature) You can recognize these cosmic energies and say hell to them and respect them (by chanting their names. Religions call it manatras but technically they are just remembering the names of those energies and saying namaste or respects to them) . So you can chant these mantras anytime anywhere in mind. Initially it is a warm up exercise of cleansing of five elements within you which are fundamental channels for mind and soul. So by chanting these mantras, the five elements, mind, intellect, chittah , ego and few other layers of the soul get cleansed. The energies get balanced within your personality and that is how the anger gets settled down. All the best wishes Loves Krishna Is heroin the best feeling in the world? What are some tips to reduce the anger of my boss? Does hate beget anger, or anger begets hate? Both my parents are killers. I feel dirty, and I can\u2019t look at them the same way anymore without feeling sick. How do I move past this? What are the tips for increasing anger? Everyone knows, that taking a deep breath, and counting to five, gives us more control of our emotions. For the rest, knowledge generally helps. Repetition trains and conditions the brain, whether we want it to, or not. Therefore, if you get into the habit of taking deep breaths, every time you get upset, then it will become natural. Next - All negative emotions and behavior evolved, because they generate an endless stream of dominant behavioral displays, which play a key role, in our selection of mates. From the moment babies gain control of their limbs, they throw them out wide, into the air. This impulse is genetically programmed behavior. Unless something negative occurs, the behavior is rewarded. Google brain chemical rewards (serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin). To a great degree, these chemicals determine human behavior. The exception: When there are no good choices, then we choose the least negative outcome. Whatever behavior you observe in the world, unless it results in a negative outcome, then it is rewarded. The reward makes it a learned behavior. We live in a materialistic world, because showing dominance and accumulating wealth raises our status. Individuals with high status are able to attract high status mates, which improves the odds of survival, of their offspring. Just for attempting to raise our status, the brain rewards us. If it didn\u2019t, then we would never attempt anything. We give a bunch of idiots the power to make us miserable, with their hurtful words and hurtful actions. The idiots don\u2019t even know, why they\u2019re doing it. Subconsciously, they\u2019re trying to raise their status, by lowering yours. All of the above, is part of our primitive, 1.0 human operating system. If you learn to control/manage your emotions, then you will upgrade to 2.0. By being able to think, rather than react, you will have many more options, in which to respond to the world. Your status will rise above 99% of the world\u2019s population, and your brain will reward you. You will become smarter, more productive, and happier. If your brain is receptive to this, then it will automatically, gradually reduce the amount of chemical reward, for your negative emotions, and behavior. Factors which slow the process: Testosterone, stress, conflict, and greed. The brain rewards memories/thoughts of fear, pain, anger, guilt, shame, and humiliation. If it didn\u2019t, then we would shun such thoughts. If we never remembered them, then we would make many more bad choices. We would continue to make the same mistakes, over and over again. If a negative memory persists, then write it down in a journal, and make a solemn commitment to read it, once a month. By organizing and regulating the memory, the subconscious will gradually reduce the amount of chemical reward. A U.K. study on the long term effects, of having a rabbit in a elementary school, classroom: Grades improved, and behavioral problems decreased. However, there were negative side effects. Rabbits get sick, and they die. Then you can\u2019t teach the kids. A different school used potted plants, instead. They got very similar results. Why? Because the teacher used, assigning care of the plants, as a reward for improved behavior, and for improved grades. At the beginning of the class, the teacher called out the full name of the two students, responsible for the care of the plants. This enhanced the chosen student\u2019s status. Control your fear, let go of the anger. Fear leads to anger leads to hate leads to suffering. Face your fears, become selfless, try having compassion and love for self and others alike. Fear and greed are roots of all evil, becomes selfless and fearless. Nip the evil in the bud. Seek inner peace.",

        "a": "It will get VERY expensive for Pakistan if the work pace gets slowed or the bureaucrats start taking bribes from Chinese businessman. The corrupt practices will have to be looked carefully while deploying. Another aspect of (any incoming) governments would be to continue with their initiatives in attractive more and more investors from not only China but also Central Asian countries. The diplomatic initiatives of NS government (imho) are not fast paced. NS seems way too lazy to travel in quick successions for many countries in central Asia and root them over for investments. Secondly, the main focus should just not be CPEC alone, but parallel ventures to augment CPEC in coming years. Does the CPEC benefit Pakistan? Will Pakistan be able to payback the loan of CPEC? What would be the impact of CPEC on Pakistan and the rest of the world? Are the Coal projects of CPEC a matter of concern for Pakistan? How is CPEC likely to effect Pakistan? Depends on how Pakistan responds to the opportunity. If the textile industry is indeed under-performing due to power cuts and the government is able to efficiently collect revenue, then it\u2019s a winner. However, Pakistan\u2019s textile industry is notorious for (a) exploiting workers, and (b) aggressively grabbing government subsidies. So unless it changes its practices, it could get wiped out. This is true across the board as Pakistan\u2019s industrialists have historically been able to manipulate the government to prevail over competition. Will the entry of Chinese businesses also level the playing field for other new investors? Anyway, let\u2019s consider the rosy scenario. As per Wikipedia, textile revenues dropped from $12.6B to $11.4B between 2014/15 and 2015/16. CPEC should at least allow that shortfall to be recuperated rapidly as it will add power generation capacity. Other agricultural and industrial exports could boom as well.",

My friend, I know its hot, this summer is actually hot and we all like prancing around naked in our rooms. The cool air around your naked body must be stimulating your brain, which is why you are more comfortable. My advice to you is: If you are a man : I understand your problem, we all like our basement to be a bit airy. Try a dhoti. Believe me, after 3 years in Ramakrishna Mission, I have learnt that a dhoti is actually very airy downstairs. If you are a woman : Please refrain from doing this, not only are you going to cause national news, but there are many students (boys) who have studied a lot for this exam. Don\u2019t let their efforts go in vain. On a brighter note, I think you should see someone. (Whispers \u201cshrink\u201d) Godspeed. Can I wear a bikini in the JEE Advanced test centre? I took JEE Mains in 2014. Can I take JEE Advanced in 2015? Why do many women like wearing skimpy clothes? Is it only to attract attention? Eg. in Tennis, girls wear short skirts, while guys wear fuller... Who can take the JEE Advanced? Can I take the JEE Advanced 2015 with a valid 210 score of JEE Main 2014? You\u2019re kidding, right? Hold on. You are kidding, right? Excuse me, but did you actually just say\u2026 You don\u2019t really expect me to answer that, do you? I see what you're saying, but if I agreed with you then we'd both be wrong. Meme's Courtesy: Facebook If rules doesn\u2019t mind its perfect K OK(hehe) Since i can\u2019t figure it out whether you are male or female( question asked anonymously). I can suggest the situation: Everyone will look you like you are from another planet Phone camera etc will be flashing over you(u see there will be some ___________ people there.don\u2019t mind if filling the underline spaced) Ladies shall hide their faces( some may not. hehe) Everyone will be sure looking you for sure rather than the 8 hour thriller coming. Invigilator shall be out of her mind seeing you,all the staff in charge shall visit you for the uniqueness. Its only the 5 points written which i think is common. If you are either of one kind, then rest can be suggested or instead can be assumed by you yourself. If you are perfectly ok with this,then you can appear the exam. Its just that please check the rules and regulations. One more thing, ignore the cunning and curious eyes if so and concentrateonto your exam I know its never a serious question, then its never a serious answer.(booooooo)",

While becoming a pro is something else, but I think anyone can play the guitar if they put their mind into it. At the end of the day, its just a motor skills to play basic guitar. Esp if you want to play some chords (and maybe sing along). Practice can make you achieve that. On a related note, ask yourself, can you juggle? I think yes. If you put in the time to practice, its a motor skill that you have to master. I teach guitar to many, including kids and adults. And recently have started sharing some chord lessons on my site,  GuitarBollywood.com   (sorry for the shameless plug) . I insist on practicing at least 5 times a week, and about 20mins once a day. You can of course do more. But a consistent practice needed to achieve your goals. Should I play bass or guitar? What should I not play in a guitar store? How can I learn to play the guitar by ear? How do I play an acoustic guitar? Playing Guitar: How would I play this riff? Any one can play a guitar, if they have interest, patience, confidence and the willpower to practise daily. Yes, I play rough, very rough and rough means wild with my Acoustic Guitar(I can play many songs) because I like to create my own Music. I practice everyday (Maybe 2 hours). I want to be Original and not someone else. There is a  Quote  which inspires me to play like crazy: Practice like you have never won, and perform like you have never lost. Anyone can play anything if he puts his mind into it. Thanks!! Yes I believe I can , I covered some songs on guitar (If you think  I am promoting myself then you are right ) Here- 1.Apologize 2.Wrecking Ball 3.Game of thrones 4.Kal ho na ho(short one) Enjoy :D Oh Yeah !

And yet, I am going to suggest  FOUR  books that will help you to understand this amazing world of marketing and how things work. Here they are. Hooked  by  Nir Eyal  and  Ryan Hoover   This book is a must read if you want to understand and learn how to drive customer engagement.

No matter how you apply them, the lessons and examples in  Traction  will help you create and sustain the growth your business desperately needs. Hacking Growth  by  Sean Ellis  and  Morgan Brown This book is a comprehensive toolkit that any company in any industry can use to implement their own Growth Hacking strategy, from how to set up and run growth teams, to how to identify and test growth levers and how to evaluate and act on the results. Hacking Growth focuses on  customers  - how to attain them, retain them, engage them and monetize them - rather than product. Ogilvy on Advertising  by David Ogilvy This book is an amazing read if you are passionate about everything advertising. Although it will not give you any present day marketing hacks or tricks, but you will get a clear idea about the core concepts of the advertising field like how to get clients and how to come up with sellable advertising.

Are you thinking about a physical business with products or a service like plumbing or electrical? What about a window cleaning business or a cleaning houses business? Online you have a host of business ideas and opportunities, like virtual assistant or freelancing your skills by copy writing or proof reading. There are affiliate programs where you can do blogging and include these to sell other people's products! The list is endless and a lot of these ideas are low cost start-ups that can get you off to a start. However, the ideas and the solutions to your problems have to be your own as you are the one who will have to take responsibility for the research, the investment and ultimately the action you take. Be wise don't just jump in, find something that interests you, because this will keep you going through the bad and lean times , then do your research, your target market and how your are going to find them and advertise to than, then when you are ready run with it and keep going. It will get tough, people will tell you that you are a fool for following your dreams and you should get a job but if you are serious and you do it right and take action, then you will see results and you can be proud of yourself! Hope this helps Is it possible to start a business with little to no money? How? I want to start a business in London. My capital is \u00a350K. Any suggestions? What are some potential low-cost businesses that can be started and operated by a teenager? What are some good businesses to start in India with a Rs. 10-12 crore capital? How do I start a business from scratch with no money, no credit and no expert friends to help? Consider your personality.  Are you an introvert or an extrovert? Think about that carefully. As choosing a business idea solely on the merits of its low-capital requirement would be a mistake. Got Skills?  Do you have anything of value to deploy to others? For example; Designers, coders, writers, consultants, photographers, teachers, all have skills they can deploy just about anywhere with pretty minimal outlay (none if you already own the equipment). If I were thinking of businesses to start in London or elsewhere, I would start with my interests, my skills, my existing assets, before I would even consider spending a single pound.

Valve then saw the opportunity for it on PC and developed it for PC.

Should I keep playing CSGO? Where can I get free skins for CSGO? How do I get a rank of 40 on the CSGO? How much would it cost to have both my valve cover gasket and ccv valve system replaced on a 2002 3251 e46? How do I actually get better at CS: GO? Valve said in one of their latest updates they have about 20~ or so people working on the game. The main people behind the updates of the game according to them (though I strongly disagree) is the game\u2019s community itself. While it\u2019s true that most new updates are community driven, all the community adds are cosmetic changes, such as skins, knives sprays and stickers. We even had a map recently, though the person who made it has contributed so much he\u2019s basically a part of the so called \u201cdevelopment team\u201d This has been used as an excuse for taking away developers and delaying updates on TF2, another one of Valve\u2019s games that\u2019s also awaiting an HL3-style-anticipated update\u2026 \u201cSmall edit\u201d There\u2019s no OFFICIAL IN CHARGE PERSON on any things Valve.

That has happened to many sites whose principle commodity was copyright-restricted media where the distribution of such media was in breach of the copyright terms. Commonly, \u201cpiracy\u201d, though this is defined differently in different jurisdictions and doesn\u2019t necessarily constitute the sum of the site\u2019s traffic. It\u2019s not part of the question, but I\u2019m going to remind the class that torrents aren\u2019t illegal, and that trackers exist for many \u201clegitimate\u201d reasons. But as long as there are restrictions on the distribution of information, there will be piracy. It\u2019s a certainty. \u201c Nature finds a way \u201d - That Chaotician bloke played by Jeff Goldblum. When children at school are told they can\u2019t play football, they\u2019ll find a way, even if they have to climb the fence and play it on the neighbouring farmer\u2019s land. Even - and this is kind of important - even if they didn\u2019t really care about football in the first place. People don\u2019t like restrictions, and information wants to be free. Maybe torrent sites will fade away over time, but only because a better technology will replace them. Has the SaaS model effectively ended software piracy? What are the laws of software piracy? Is piracy killing the game industry? What is piracy like in China? What does film piracy lead to? They will adapt and continue. Torrent sites were not a new invention, they were the latest iteration of a long, long arms race between intellectual property owners and pirates. A hundred years ago, people avoided paying professional piano players by recording performances on player piano rolls. Sixty years ago, pirates would cut grooves into old x-rays that could be played on a record player. Thirty years ago, people used dual-head tape recorders to make copies and sell them on the street. Twenty years ago it was camcorders in movie theaters and CD burners. Ten years ago it was Napster and Pirate Bay. Today it\u2019s videos on torrents, social media sites and Youtube. As those are shut down, new technologies will make it possible for pirates to share illegal content, and new technologies will be invented to stop them.",

I was a science student till 12 and now I am pursuing B.A. from University of Delhi. Can I ever get a chance to join Indian Air Force? I'm a 12th passed non medical student and I want to join the Indian Air Force or Indian Navy as a pilot. What should I do? I am a student related to science with PCB, and I have recently passed my 12th class. How I can join the Indian Air Force Can a B.tech biotech student get into the Indian Air Force? If so, how and what are the branches open for them? Yes. Engineering graduates get paid more. Because the positions you can apply for after your schooling all have a lower pay band than the positions you can apply after your B\u2019Tech degree. However, if you join the NDA after your 12th, and become an Air Force officer through the National Defense Academy, then you will be paid the same as the graduates as you too will have an engineering degree by the time you pass out of the academy. But you\u2019re just gonna apply after 12th to be an airman, then you won\u2019t be paid much. All the other graduates will be paid more as they are officers.",

        "a": "As you mention you are from india !! we are from the country where  people are usually get judged  for silly reasons. So telling about your past is huge thing. One can easily judged. This  fear makes us to hide many things from our partner . I am sure you also hide something from her. Not that big one but many small things which you don't want her to know about. If someone earn the trust then people are open up to them and tells everything.  Earning trust is long time process.  We have to wait for secretes. When i found out something about my girlfriend, i was in the same situation as you are in now. But some how we survive. Stay calm. And just pass on this hard time. Make your self comfortable and talk about this with her. If you love each other things will be sorted. As you say she is good person, be with her don't judge her and show her that you are ok with this (i know you are not but still). You both have to support each other.  Sit together and talk about this  is perfect for this situation. Earn her trust and tell her to tell you all the things about past. Then forget those this, move on and start your new life. Past doesn't matter bro. Live in the present and discuss your future. I found out my girlfriend for almost 1.5 years has lied to me almost everything about her life. I was about to marry her. What should I do? What should I do if my fiancee misled me into liking her by lying about her past? I feel tricked and cheated. Now I don't trust her at all. My girlfriend left me for a guy from her past. I still want her back? What should I do? I lied to my girlfriend about some things I've done in the past, I've told her about these. How do I fix it with her? My mom has made me insecure about my girlfriend. How do I get past this? Perhaps it\u2019s a cultural thing. But being married previously and being older doesn\u2019t matter much in the US. Maybe she was terribly embarrassed. The concern to me would be that seemingly little lies could add up and become bigger lies. Perhaps that is your concern? What does you \u2018gut\u2019 tell you? Ask her why she lied. Then ask her if there are any other things that she should be sharing. Tell her that this is her opportunity to get it all out on the table. Hopefully you can both build trust beyond this point, and continue to move forward. If not, that\u2019s ok too. Take it easy. First off, she must have thought that telling the truth would scare you  away.  So I think she had an explicable reason to lie. It does not matter if she is older or not. If your chemistry works well, go ahead Man. Move on, it will hurt for a while but in the long run you will be better off. What else has she been hiding from you? And for the love of god do not get her pregnant. And with moving on i mean jump ship, bail , run the other way, eject as far away as possible. If you can.",

        "a": "\u201cDracula\u201d was based upon Vlad III of Wallachia. Commonly known as Vlad Dracula or Vlad the Impaler. He went on raids in Transylvania and was described by an eyewitness as \u201ca demented psychopath, a sadist, a gruesome murderer, a masochist,\u201d and as \u201cbeing worse than Caligula or Nero.\u201d The invention of movable type contributed to the popularity of Vlad III, and stories about him became bestsellers. To enhance sales, they were published in books with woodcuts on their covers that depicted horrific scenes. Editions published in Nuremberg in 1499 and Strasbourg in 1500 depict Vlad dining at a table surrounded by dead or dying people on poles, hence his nickname \u201cThe Impaler\u201d: Vlad had a big copper cauldron built and put a lid made of wood with holes in it on top. He put people in the cauldron and put their heads in the holes and fastened them there; then he filled it with water and set a fire under it and let people cry their eyes out until they were boiled to death. And then he invented frightening, terrible, unheard of tortures. He ordered that women be impaled together with their suckling babies on the same stake. The babies fought for their lives at their mothers' breasts until they died. Then he had the women's breasts cut off and put the babies inside headfirst; thus he had them impaled together.\u201d Since the middle of the 19th century, Romanian historians have \u201ctreated Vlad as one of the greatest Romanian rulers, emphasizing his fight for the independence of the Romanian lands.\u201d Vlad's acts of cruelty were often represented as \u201crational acts serving national interest.\u201d Bram Stoker\u2019s  Dracula  was the first book to make a connection between Dracula and vampirism. He had drawn attention to the blood-sucking vampires of Romanian folklore from Transylvanian superstitions. Knowing about Attila the Hun's destructive campaigns and the alleged Hunnic origin of the Sz\u00e9kelys, Stoker had wrote that Dracula had been of Sz\u00e9kely origin. Niccol\u00f2 Modrussa's statement describes Vlad the Impaler as: \u201cnot very tall, but very stocky and strong, with a cold and terrible appearance, a strong and aquiline nose, swollen nostrils, a thin and reddish face in which the very long eyelashes framed large wide-open green eyes; the bushy black eyebrows made them appear threatening. His face and chin were shaven, but for a moustache. The swollen temples increased the bulk of his head. A bull\u2019s neck connected with his head from which black curly locks hung on his wide-shouldered person.\u201d Note:  most information has been taken from Wikipedia.",

        "a": "Hello Everyone, Thanks for A2A. Yes, This year's cut-off should be a little high because the paper was too easy. Since the seats are only 60 and almost 15,000 students appeared for BLAT 2017. Hence there are complete chances that Cut-off will be High. Now talking about the numbers, Past two year's cut off was approx 300 marks for General. Although paper of past 2 years were not this simple as this year's. Hence I think this year it may cross even 320\u2013330 (For General). F.Y.I. The seats for General category is not 60, I ts 28 . Remaining seats are reserved for SCs, STs and OBCs. P.s. - This is not exact Cut-off. I am even not the correct person to answer this question, cause I appeared for BLAT 2 years ago hence i dont have much idea about this exam now. What should I expect the cutoff to be for the BA (Hons.) Arts Exam 2017 for BHU Hostel? What would be a safe score for English Hons.? Is the BHU entrance exam for a BA LLB, hard? What is the expected cutoff of the BHU chemistry entrance exam? What will be the expected cutoff marks for the BHU UET BA LLB 2017? What will be the expected cutoff for M.Com BHU 2017? I've taken  BLAT 2017 . BLAT's difficulty level was below expectations. Paper was quite  easy  (or many questions were quite easy) but it may lead to  higher cut offs. \u00a0 In 2016, BLAT paper was kind of different. In 2016,  Idioms & phrases & one word substitution  were introduced in BLAT while BLAT 2014 & 2015 lack it. \u00a0 Although, 2016 paper was  relatively harder  that that of 2017 (especially  Maths  section) but this year Maths, GK etc were easy. \u00a0 Last year cut offs  were  \u00a0 General:- 276 OBC:- 236 SC:- 162 ST:- 87 \u00a0 So there might be a slight increase in cut offs. As per my prediction  (I may be wrong too) ,  CLAT 2017 's cut offs will be around:- \u00a0 General:- 300+  OBC:- 275+ SC:- 190+  ST:- 110+  \u00a0 PS:- As per answers checked by me through internet and calculator, my score is around 180 & still 44 questions still left to be checked.  \u00a0 Extremely low chances to get BHU. What's your expected score?",

        "a": "Few key factors: 1. Belief:  You should be convinced that Mediation is not a fictional story and marketing gimmick, but an exercise which is in existence for centuries and have helped millions. If from the day one you think it is rubbish and has no value, then it won\u2019t work. If you practice with this mindset, maybe after few days, you will leave it with enough complaints. 2. Teacher:  Find a teacher in initial days. Join some school to practice a particular technique. The way you enter a nursery school to learn alphabets, then in school you learn grammar, maths, science and with time you become independent. The same rule applies to Meditation. In the beginning, follow words of an experienced master. 3. Practice:  Practice it for a very long period. If possible practice it everyday, otherwise at least few days a week. You could start with 10 mins each day and then could reach to 1 hr, 3 hrs, 7 hrs, etc. It is up to you how much time you have, and how deep you would like to dive in. Don\u2019t surrender quickly. The way you spend many years in school and college to become a doctor or a scientist, show similar dedication to learn this art. There is no short cut. It should become your daily routine the way you brush your teeth and take a shower, etc. 4. No miracle:  Please don\u2019t expect any miracle while practicing. Things will happen naturally. The result will be in your behavior. You don\u2019t have to set a goal while practicing this. Just do it without any goal. Few things in life should be performed without creating any goal. Just keep doing it. 5. Discipline:  Be discipline in life. It could be around your lifestyle, food habits, drinking, sleeping patterns, fitness, etc. It is important to live a disciplined life to be successful in this journey. After drinking 2 liters of beer or wine if you sit for meditation, it won\u2019t give any result. It will only create a hallucination. What is the key to meditation? Is doing meditation for a long time bad? What is a key aspect of meditation that many practitioners are neglecting or missing? How does meditation help? Is it harmful to meditate for an hour? Three Main things are required\u2014\u2014- Firm Determination Regularity No break, Continuity. You have determined to enter in Meditation, With ability to sit Still , relaxed, and with lot of Patience and Fearlessness. Meditation is an Event occuring itself naturally , cant be forced , so you must have a lovers patience to wait endlessly till event take place. When Event take place , have courage to go in the Depth because pearls are in depth. regularity is a must. As we clean our utensils daily so iys cleaning of inside. So enter in meditation fearlessly, with determination and Courage. Consistent practice. You just need to practice every day, even if it\u2019s just a minute. However long you can sit for is fine, and if you practice every day, eventually that minute will stretch into two, three, fifteen, or an hour. This will \u201cperhaps\u201d be perfect for you. MEDITATE \u2026 CONTEMPLATE \u2026 RE-CREATE AND THEN \u2026 CELEBRATE \u2026 Your Own Answer and Many More Yet to Surprise You To No End. #1) Realize that all thoughts are conscious beliefs systems acting like trains attracting your \u201cAttention\u201d to get on board with their one track mind. #2) Visualize floating above the clouds where all belief thoughts are below the clouds. #3) Focus your Intentions Attention only on your breath for 10 minutes. If you find yourself back in that train car, float up again above the clouds and just smile. #4) And then if you can imagine the real you going into the infinite timeless zone of a pure black velvet space of warm soundless resonating love. Oh Ya \u2026 watch my below video that I am giving to the world hoping that someone \u2026 some day will be able to use this to discover their own unique and eternal Divinity. Love is For Always Geography Of The Mind Part III - Meditation, Contemplation, Re Creation & Celebration Have you ever wondered why, after more than 70,000 years \u2026 the human species has still failed to progress out of the colossal savagery of tribal starvation, human slavery, feminine bondage and war? Could it be the narrow limits, the impediments that our languages continues to bind us to, bind us like rusty iron belief chains linking us to our assessor's dilemma? :p>",

        "a": "Ok here is a step by step guide. It may not work for you but it worked for me. Figure out if you really want to date this girl. Will she make you happy? Will you make her happy? Go over how your gonna ask her. In front of a mirror, a wall, with a friend. It doesn\u2019t matter how but go over it while speaking out loud. A good close friend can always help you. Figure out the time and place, make sure she will be there and that you will be there that way you can get yourself ready for it. It is never fun to be ready for it and then her not be there. Don\u2019t over do it with her. Don\u2019t grab her hand or anything like that. Just ask the question real quick and if she says no don\u2019t make it a big deal. Hope this helped. Josh Is it weird to ask a girl out on a date? How do you ask a girl to hang out when she barely knows you? How do I get over the fear of talking or hanging out with girls? How do I get a man to ask me out? How do I get over the fear of talking to a girl I like? Don't necessarily frame it as such. Ask her to hang out casually, maybe do something arbitrary and enjoyed by everyone, like coffee or a concert or something. It doesn't have to be some grand gesture, cause that might put pressure on both of you. Just play it cool at first, buy yourself time to see if you have a connection, and if you do, ramp it up slowly. By now I assume you know something about this lady. Does she have a pet (s)? A tiny wicker basket with a packet cat or dog treats can be placed on her desk at work, along with a note from you. Coffee lover? Same idea, only coffee mug with a mini-bag of coffee. The gift doesn\u2019t have to be expensive ( in fact, it shouldn\u2019t be, you might scare her off). This is a way of introducing yourself in a sweet old fashioned way ( in the Victorian Era, it was common for gentlemen callers to bring a small gift- flowers, candy, ect,) Use the factoid I just gave you as an ice breaker. On your note, you ask to meet her somewhere PUBLIC. A park, the library, or a food court/restaurant/cafeteria. If she shows up, then take it from there. They never bite. They don\u2019t even pinch hard. Most girls are wondering what\u2019s wrong with them, why don\u2019t boys notice them? When a boy finally does talk to a girl, sometimes she\u2019s trying so hard to act normal that she acts uninterested or rude. Sometimes it\u2019s just a \u201cdeer in the headlights\u201d moment for her. Guys have the advantage: they can ask whomever they want to ask and they know when they are going to do it. Girls can\u2019t read minds. Most girls want to be noticed by guys. Start out by talking about little things: what\u2019s going on around you, the weather, your class, etc. She is probably way more shy than you are, and not about to talk much until she gets to know you. The outgoing girls are more popular because guys don\u2019t have to work so hard with them, but the shy girls are worth the effort.",

There is a small story to speak up before letting you know the interest of Masayoshi Son (CEO-SoftBank) & it goes as follows: Back when Uber was still quite small, Son passed up a chance to invest in the San Francisco-based cab-hailing service. \u201c We did have an opportunity to invest in Uber\u2026 I had the chance to meet Travis (Uber founder Travis Kalanick) in the very early days and we didn\u2019t...\u201d  he said. Now if you just see the numbers of valuation, Uber is valued more than $70 billion. Since turning down Uber, Son has tried to make good of that missed opportunity by buying stakes in rival cab-hailing services such as China\u2019s Didi Chuxing, South-East Asia\u2019s Grab and India\u2019s Ola. At the same time, SoftBank insulated the group\u2019s balance sheet from riskier investments by bidding on a massive technology investment fund in collaboration with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF). Now coming to other startups like Flipkart, Snapdeal & Paytm\u2026. In 2000, SoftBank invested $20 million in China\u2019s Alibaba, then a fledgling e-commerce start-up. In June last year, SoftBank harvested $10 billion when it pared its stake from 32%. Hugh numbers right!! SoftBank analysed that India being a potential country with emerging markets is the best place to park funds. They have experienced a very good returns from their investments in Alibaba, this made them to choose most popular ventures in India. To me it is a pure business made out of our country.  To my surprise, SoftBank records $1.4 billion loss from India investments.. Read more about it in this article:  SoftBank records $1.4 billion loss from India investments - The Economic Times Now the main thing, why are Indian VCs not showing up keen interest in some good startups in India: Investing in a startup is a combination of risk appetite and ecosystem maturity. Indian VCs do not yet have the appetite to invest 100s of Mn$ in another company. VCs from outside India are investing in Indian companies partly to hedge their exposure in other markets and partly because of the promise these companies offer. The local Investment ecosystem is still evolving, when compared with those in USA or Japan. I hope you got my perception. Disclosure : This is purely my perception on SoftBank taking up those investments. Happy Trading:) Which Indian startups failed? How does SoftBank make a profit by investing in a company? How much did Softbank invest in Yahoo Japan? Why don't indian VCs invest in two startups of same domain? How do you think about the stock investment? You are wrong in thinking and in saying that Softbank is the only firm. They are more in the news because they have investments in some of the bigger and older Indian startups. Personally, I think their approach towards startup funding in India is all wrong and they are running after the wrong business model to fund. I am expecting that some day, their patience will run thin and they will either be either forced or willing to write off their investments in all the companies that you have mentioned in the details.",

        "a": "Faith, if interpreted as blind belief in some higher power without any proof, has nothing in common with Science. Faith, when supplemented by personal effort to seek for God or Truth, leads to direct experience and goes beyond belief. In this picture Faith is similar to a scientific hypothesis which is accepted only if it is proved right through experience. Religion is not about belief but about direct perception \u00a0 \u00a0\"There are certain religious facts which, as in external science, have to be perceived and upon them religion will be built.  Of course, the extreme claim that you must believe every dogma of a religion is degrading to the human mind. The man who asks you to believe everything, degrades himself, and, if you believe, degrades you too. The sages of the world have only the right to tell us that they have analyzed their minds and have found these facts, and if we do the same we shall also believe, and not before.  That is all there is in religion.\" (The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, 2:163). \u00a0 \u00a0\"The proof, therefore, of the Vedas is just the same as the proof of this table before me, pratyaksa, direct perception. This I see with the senses, and the truths of spirituality we also see in a superconscious state of the human soul.\" (The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, 3:253). If I believe in science because I trust in what is logical, is science not a type of faith? Why? Have your research and/or knowledge in physics, space, or other sciences increased your faith in God? Why? Is there any faith involved in science? Why is science always at odds with Christianity? What is the science behind an unbreakable faith? Why do some hold on to hope no matter how bad things get? There are two kinds of knowledge: knowledge of things and knowledge of truth. So far as \"things\" are concerned, they display no attribute that cannot be elucidated by direct argument. But where truths are concerned, it is only indirect argument that can throw any light upon them. Indeed, in the case of scientific truths, the validity of indirect, or inferential argument is a matter of general acceptance. Since religious truths are proved by the logic of similar inferential argument. It may legitimately be argued that they fall into the same intellectual bracket as truths. This is something Science and Faith have in common. A2A:  What do Faith and Science have in common? Absolutely nothing. Faith is a steadfast and unwavering belief in a system with little introspection or experimentation or proof. Science is a field of study covering the entire physical and natural world that relies on observation, experimentation and proof. The definitions make it seem like complete opposites. faith or religion is also science, where as faith tries read the content whole and Science tries to read part of the given object. But both fails. In this view religion is more scientific than Science. Where Science reads the object, by dividing it, generates knowledge, by that knowledge, collect the materials, assembles it to make atom bomb. where as religion tries to understand the presented object, goes on thinking, gets a result. Hence Science got both characters of destruction and creation. where as faith or religion do not disturb the presented object, makes experiment in the mind, tries to solve, problem, Hence science is believed by most of people by its destruction attitudes, since they have destruction character or mind. where as faith and religion tries to elaborate the truth, Since truth cannot be written in words, and it shacks away. because untruth is the cause of creation. materialistic world can be written, unmaterialistic world like truth cannot be written and it is experienced. both are truth, in there definite domain. to get a mixture it is difficult. Since police is deferent and criminal is deferent. thanks",

I do it because I like it, not because I think it\u2019s \u201coh i look cool\u201d even though some hacking techniques look pretty neat for passionate people, but really boring to other people. Most people who do it because it\u2019s cool and not because they really like it are not really hackers \u2026 It takes a lot of dedication and motivation to read code and write an exploit (software that leverage one or multiple vulnerabilities to induce non expected behaviour). On my end, only people who write exploits or exploit vulnerabilities themselves, write their own tools, do proper research or find creative solutions can be considered as real hackers. The rest are just users of hacking tools made by other people. It\u2019s not because you can jailbreak your iPhone with the latest jailbreaking tools that you\u2019re a hacker nope \u2026 the people who wrote the jailbreaking tools are hackers. Anyone can use kali, metasploit or any other hacking tool with some reading, but they aren\u2019t real hackers until they understand how the tools works or write their own or find creative solutions. A lot of pentesters are security professionals and are not hackers. Depends what your definition of a hacker is though, nobody really universally agree on that definition. Any security practitioner will use hacking tools. A hacker can\u2019t humanly write all the tools himself/herself, so yeah we use existing tools obviously. What will make them a hacker is understanding or have an idea of the inner working of the tool instead of just using tools blindly. Obviously, you can\u2019t humanly know how every single hacking tool work but you got some idea of it. And really, if you\u2019re not into it, you\u2019ll find it really boring. It\u2019s a lot of information gathering, probing, poking, testing stuffs, writing code, reading code and smile when you get control of a computer system. All your display is only a lot of text scrolling fast on your screen. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t look sexy, it\u2019s not eye-candy. Some stuffs are repetitive and boring : hashcracking, scanning networks, etc but it\u2019s part of the process. The kick is really when you get access to the computer systems you were authorized to test and prove to a client that yes you had access to internal data. Then you report to the client, help them fix the vulnerabilities, delete all the local copies of the data you grabbed and you go on with your job. Being ethical in that job is really a super important trait to have as you can get access to sensitive systems or data on some contracts. Hacks really don\u2019t look sexy to outsiders. I could show you an exploit output and you\u2019d be like : \u201cOo, what the hell is this garble? It looks complex and boring.\u201d. It\u2019s only text and pretty much boring for outsiders. Is a pilot's job really as desirable or cool as kids think it is? Have you ever hacked a Facebook account? What can hackers teach web developers in one minute to change the way they are thinking? Is being a hacker cool, or is it just boring and you have to study a lot? How can I hack any application? We sure do. You bet it is cool. What, would you rather be flipping burgers in a downtown fast food restaurant, or maybe sitting at a desk filing reports all day every day, forever? Those jobs are uncool and require no skill. They are repetitive and do not excite anyone. Hacking, however, is different every time and actually is engaging. it takes skill, too, and once you learn about hacking you really think that everyone else is just missing out. Cool!!

Although near equal\u2019s in power, Marvel stated that Odin was perhaps the most powerful skyfather. Although Zeus is superior in power to Thor, Thor still gave a good fight. The Black Knight was able to absorb Zeus lightning with his blade and return it against him.

        "a": "If you are being authentic, the fact that you are in line for a CEO role should have no baring on the fact that you have been asked for ideas on a specific problem. Authenticity is a key characteristic of a leader. If you are in line then your leadership talent has already been considered so use it. Being disingenuous is not wise. The only thing worse than being passed over for a role you are either not suited to (as suggested in another answer) or not ready for - is getting it. If you have ideas based on the insight that you do have - just share them. I\u2019m not sure what \u201cproper\u201d insight is, but if its insufficient for you to generate ideas - get more. The best way to do this is by speaking to people if doing so is appropriate. The best place to start is with the people at the coal face, people suffering daily from the underperformance usually have a great deal to say. If your motivation is your CEO ambition and not to help these people - ignore this and hypothesize. Secondly, look at the data to see if the patterns suggested by the insights are consistent. The route causes, or at least a starting place to discover them, is usually found between what people tell you and what the data tells you. With that in mind, one of the things that is required of leaders in executive roles is to \u201cgo beyond the data\u201d. Data just pushes you to the right but business is not simply a math problem. The most valuable tool that executive has is their gut. A CEO needs to be able to make decisions confidently with incomplete data all the time. You use the term proper which to me, is a strange turn of phrase. Proper implies moral, authentic or real or even true. Maybe what you perceive as improper is simply beyond your realm of comfort. If you truly perceive the problem presented as improper then then you have a host of other considerations. I suspect that you are uncomfortable trusting your gut in this instance. It\u2019s no coincidence that CEO legend Jack Welch of GE fame titled his biography, \u201cStraight from the gut\u201d. Could you be looking at this upside down? You are seeking the explanation of what to do, I assume with the intension of then doing it. Maybe you should act in line with your instincts and then invest the effort in explaining your approach? Your gut instinct is the cumulative wisdom of your thoughts as validated by experience. Your veracity when analyzing past experiences determines your wisdom. Your approach must be pretty special to have yielded the standout success & support that has put you in line for CEO role. Your ability to explain it to others will determine your success in the role. This involves the transition from unconsciously competent to consciously competent. This critical transition is often overlooked. The books are written by observing the behaviors of those who have demonstrated sustainable great performance. Good leaders produce good results but great leaders figure out how to scale great leadership. Figuring out how you do what you do, is a better investment of your effort. By transcending ego and its focus on \u201chow do I get to be the CEO \u201d, you are freeing your mind to consider how best to serve the organization as its CEO . Now your mind is focussed on serving your shareholders and this mindset is what the board should be looking for. Hope this helps. The company I run is being acquired. I've been told I'll be replaced as CEO, but that I can stay on a different role if I want to. Should I? RadioShack's CEO just resigned. Who, as Garriques' replacement, has the best chance of turning the company around? What is the best advice for a young, first-time startup CEO? Who are the best dressed CEOs on the planet? How do CEOs live if they only have a one dollar annual salary? With all due respect and not to undermine your successes but if your asking this question and do not intuitively know the answer, you're probably not suitable for the role. You are going to be the CEO and you ask for ideas on Quora?",

The local language here is Telugu with a slightly different dialect. The united state of Andhra Pradesh had 3 regions - Coastal Andhra, Telangana & Rayalaseema. Each region has their own dialect of Telugu, which differed in slightly from the dialects of the other regions of the state. Even though the dialects are dofferent, the people from all the 3 regions can easily understand the other dialects of the language. The present Tollywood industry is based in Hyderabad, Telangana and the artists from both the states are, together, producing films in Telugu, which is being understood by every Telugu person of the 2 states. So, there is no need for the state of Telangana to seperately produce their films in the Telangana dialect. Why is the Reddy caste so powerful in Telangana & Andhra Pradesh? I completed Jr.intermediate in Andhra Pradesh. How can I change my state for the second year to Telangana? What is the situation in Andhra Pradesh after it was divided into two states? Are there any benefits to Telangana peoples? Is there an EAMCET in 2018 in Andhra Pradesh? What are the futures of all the local political parties that exist in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, etc.?... This question is purely out if Partial knowledge. The language of both Ap and Telangana is the same and it is TELUGU. Funfact here, the kind of Telugu used in Telugu movies is neither fully that of AP or telangana. So it makes it easier for anyone to understand the movies easily. I think the question is not properly asked. Telugu is common language for both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. You mean asking local assent? Then the assent will be different for all districts in both states. Actually Tollywood is based at Hyderabad which is Capital of Telangana.

Analysing why it has decided to leave such a hot market would need a multi pronged approach/ GM was always keen on quality of its products,and keeping market competent in India ,where we find another car in every Rs10000 price range,was difficult.Perhaps this alongwith being not able to catch up with cut throat competition in market would have been reason for falling numbers. When numbers fall,dealers are not happy and they loose interest in selling the brand,equally affected are services. Services have a major stake while deciding which car to buy.With all stakes going negative it would have pushed the volumes down,unless there were more launches with aggressive marketing. This has to be analysed with upcoming BS6 norms in 3 4 years,upgrading would have required a huge amount of money,and with such low numbers it might not have been a good business to work out. GM as a brand is too big,but it seems in India they have given up the competition to big brothers who already lead in market. As a brand they have kept their promises of quality and customer satisfaction.And we can hope someday they will be back when they feel market is ready for them. How is work at General Motors? And what is it like to intern at General motors? (In India) General Motors has recently exited the Indian market. It's safe to assume that the prices will fall. So is it wise to buy these cars now?

You is the word which raises maximum amount of confusion for foreigners,when they start learning Hindi. There are 3 main words used in Hindi for the meaning of You. The usage depends upon amount of respect you want to give to the person you are addresing. First word is  Aap (\u0906\u092a) .  Aap  is used for a person who is elder than you or the person you respect. Second is T um (\u0924\u0941\u092e).  Tum  is used to address people who are of your age or has an equal status as you. Amount of respect is similar as for peers. Last word is  Too/Tu  (\u0924\u0942).  Too  as a word does not show any respect. It is used to address people you feel are inferior to you. Also in some parts of India  tu  is used to address friends and siblings. With the people you don't want to show respect or they don't need formalit in their interaction. The usage also some what depends on the region you are. In metropolitan cities in corporates, bosses use  tu  for subordinates. In eastern UP  Tu  a bad word to use, in Haryanvi it is frequently used. There are three words for the word \u2018you\u2019 in Hindi. \u2018tuu,\u2019 which is grammatically singular and is used to address people who are either very close to you, or, with people whom you are not familiar with and upset with. The English equivalent of \u2018You is crazy!\u2019 and \u2018You is dead fool!\u2019 \u2018tum,\u2019 which is grammatically plural and is used with among familiar friends, siblings, cousins, and people who being friendly with each other. In English along the lines of \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018What are you upto?\u2019 \u2018Want to grab a bite to eat?\u2019 Noting here the casual tone from speaker to addressee. \u2018aap,\u2019 which is grammatically plural and is used with people who are older than the speaker, unknown to the speaker, and those who the speaker wishes to show courtesy (could be of any age). English contextual examples are, \u2018How are you (sir/ma\u2019am)?\u2019 \u2018And what work do you do?\u2019 \u2018You are a very bright child, good work!\u2019 That said, given how complicated and varied social interactions can be, we find that there are uses of these 2nd person pronouns that we would not have expected. Some people do not use the courteous one (aap) at all, and some don\u2019t use \u2018tuu.\u2019 If you\u2019re learning Hindi, you will quickly realize this and best to note when which is used in what situation.",

        "a": "Good question. There have been ongoing debates in the fields of aesthetics and philosophy of art that address this issue. While the majority of writers and thinkers would stand by the Postmodern argument that beauty is relative, a cultural (shifting) construct, that does not absolve us from considering whether even the amorphous potential of aesthetic desire (the enjoyment of looking for its own sake) can be classified as a form of \u201cbeauty\u201d, indispensable to attracting and maintaining visual attention. Yes, the more cerebral forms of art do contradict or ignore this (or play with its concomitant qualities of the Abject or simply mundane as ironic counterparts). Still, plenty of heralded artists continue to produce visually compelling, even stunning, examples of pure retinal fireworks (Richter), or nuanced meditations of tone and touch (Celmins), or rich amalgams of blockbuster color and shape trading on emotionally-laden images (Kerry James Marshall). These and others show the draw of beauty in some form remains strong. So, while I don\u2019t think art must have beauty as a quality to be considered fully art, much art does partake and evoke in its (viewer-complicit) aura. I also don\u2019t think a definition of art of much practical use can truly exist. Is modern art art? What is the aim of modern art? Is modern art easy to create? Is beauty important in modern art? Can anything be art if we accept modern art? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and there are many beholders, and they are all biased. But first, let\u2019s look at one of the definitions of art: the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. Should beauty be part of  that  definition, or any of them? Beauty is not only reserved for the visual. For instance, the theory of general relativity is beautiful. Vivaldi\u2019s  Four Seasons  is beautiful. Something needn't be beautiful to be appealing. We wouldn\u2019t have Liv Tyler if that were true. Beauty can denote both the physical aesthetics of something like its colour, shape or form as well as traits that appeal to the intellect and emotions. However, the most important aspect of beauty, is that it is biased. That is, it is dependant on the person that it is observed by. For that reason, I should say that the theory of general relativity and Vivladi\u2019s  Four Seasons  are beautiful  to me  and might not be appealing to you. Another important aspect that is import with regards to bias, it that it is dependant on culture, time, location, and more. A better question is: \u201cWhat is regarded as beautiful now, as apposed to x?\u201d. The next question is: \u201cWhat is regarded as beautiful in milieu x?\u201d. The next question, and probably the most important one is: \u201cDid the artist intend it to be beautiful and what did the artist regard as beautiful?\u201d In conclusion: Beauty and art are in many ways analogous. Both are open to interpretation, and mostly rely on the viewer. The viewer eihter makes up their mind immediately based on their bias (for instance I do not listen to heavy metal), or they take their time to understand the subject or intent because their bias allowed for intrigue. So yes beauty should form part of the definition of art, because they share many similarities. PS. Remember context. Art can be both a noun and adverb: I make art. It is an art. That was done artfully. Beauty nowadays tends to be considered as subjective and in the mind of the viewer, and therefore not necessarily an artistic definition. Indeed it may not be the primary consideration especially if the art is conceptual. For example, Fountain by Marcel Duchamp was an urinal that the artist exhibited at an exhibition in 1917  Fountain (Duchamp) - Wikipedia  to draw attention that art could be anything the artist said it was. This is not as facetious as it sounds because art has progressed to emcompass greater experiences of the world and the realisation that there can be many interpretations of single truths. Basically beauty is now considered relative, not absolute. Art is not just the piece of work, or a set of works, but also their position in context with the rest of the body of art works. This means that art makes a statement about the times we live in, and can involve a conversation with art, with yourself, with science, with the world, about any topic or by providing a representative statement and by offering a unique view. In Ecuador, I saw an exhibit of artists who had works from the past 20 years dealing with colonialism, culture shock, rebellion, resistance, and collaboration. In New Mexico I saw an exhibit by young artists dealing with alienation and identity. Regardless of the idea, art still involves beauty from the ability to captivate, enrapture, ask the viewer to examine and contemplate it, and show symmetry or asymmetry in the expression, often one of the elements of \u201cbeauty\". The piece will have a mood--the humanity involved both as representation of idea or reflection of truth is often another element of beauty. So it depends on your intention as an artist, your expectations as a viewer, and your ability to express it. Simplicity of expression is also an element many use to define beauty. So I just walked through several museums exhibits taking a few photos as works I want to further think about. The works I chose were often pleasingly beautiful, or simplified in expression, but most often ones that touched me in terms of a memory, mood or idea I wanted to think about. It really doesn\u2019t seem that way. If you had to choose between being locked up in the Louvre or the modern art museum in Paris for a week, which would you choose? Art and beauty isn\u2019t as relative and subjective as modern thinkers think, as proven out by science and history. There are natural laws and physics associated with beauty which are timeless and ever repeating, which cross most contexts and cultures time and again.",

        "a": "Correcting someone who hadn\u2019t asked for this is the opposite of sexual attraction. Getting mad and still dating instead of leaving the man alone is also the opposite of sexual attraction. It makes people feel guilty of something they haven\u2019t even done. If you correct someone, you assume you are better or superior. If you get mad at your partner, you assume they love you so much they would tolerate anything from you. Well, it seems that you have overestimated your role in your partner\u2019s life. You don\u2019t seem sexy anymore. You can be associated with an angry lady or with a mother, not with someone who is desirable. How to keep the interest? If you feel mad, just walk away. Assume you are not compatible with this person instead of correcting him. If you yourself were attracted to him, you would not waste time on proving him wrong, anyway. So this is only fair. How can an attractive young man keep himself from cheating on every woman he gets with? Marriage: What should a man do if he is losing interest in the woman he is engaged to? How can a woman get a man to value her as a woman? What ways can she show a man she is valuable to him? Why does a girl keep talking to a boy after rejecting him even when she knows he loves her? Why would a man ask a woman if she loves him if he doesn't love her? Why would he care? I\u2019m thinking that a better way to phrase the question would have been, \u201cWhy did  my  man lose sexual interest in  me  after he got to know the real me better, especially after I got mad at him and chastised him for some perceived slight?\u201d And the answer to that is, as hard as it may be to believe, we guys don\u2019t like to stay close to woman who get mad for no apparent reason, or who assume they have authority over us in areas we have not agreed to cede it. We even have a slogan to codify that sentiment: \u201cDon\u2019t stick it in Crazy.\u201d (Well, actually, we don\u2019t use the pronoun, we use an antecedent, but I write for all ages, so\u2026) Now, granted, that\u2019s not entirely fair. Maybe you\u2019re not really cray-cray. And I do have a personal rule of thumb to take an OP at his or her word when possible. But consider: you generalize your guy\u2019s behavior (or maybe every guy you\u2019ve dated) to the entire 3.5 billion male population; you generalize his (or their) response to yourself to the entire group of women he (or they) have ever dated; you consider your getting mad and/or correcting him as something that no right-thinking person would respond to adversely; and you treat someone getting to know you better, and you getting mad and correcting him as two roughly equivalent stimuli. Any one of these points is a fairly normal level of neurosis (I\u2019m using that as a layman\u2019s term, not as a clinical diagnosis), but you mix all of them together, and you\u2019ve got a pretty good base for some crazy stew. I heard someone say something in passing one time that really stuck with me: \u201cThe single common element in all your failed relationships is you.\u201d If you\u2019re not talking about a single man, but rather all the men you\u2019ve dated, and if every last one of them has lost interest in being intimate with you after they got to know you better, and saw how you get mad for no apparent reason and correct them when they didn\u2019t need or want correction, then I am going to gently suggest to you that maybe they aren\u2019t the ones who are broken. Maybe they\u2019re exhibiting very normal aversion behavior upon realizing what\u2019s really going on inside that gorgeous head of yours. The solution for you would be to take a very hard, very courageous look in the mirror, find your own behaviors that are less attractive than you wish to be, and eliminating them. A good cognitive behavioral therapist may be able to help with that. Or, may be able to look you over and declare that I\u2019m full of hot air and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with you. And in that case, where I\u2019m full of it, and the men who lose interest in you are doing so inexplicably, well\u2026 I got nothin\u2019. Sorry. Maybe you\u2019re dating insecure, immature guys, and need to start looking for a better class of guy, someone who doesn\u2019t do things to make you angry, and doesn\u2019t need your correction. They are out there, they just might need to be drawn out of their shells. Best of luck to you. Because, he is only after women for superficial reasons - their looks and sexuality. Mere sexual attraction is fleeting like an orgasm, and becomes ordinary/obsolete once you have gotten what you\u2019ve come for. This scenario (losing interest after getting to know the person) reveals one\u2019s character, or the lack of one. It speaks of immaturity - emotional and physiological. He could be at any age to exhibit such behaviour - some people just do not outgrow their childish inclinations. For illustration: when I was 4, I remember wanting a ball for a long time; once I had it - it was no longer of interest to me after I\u2019d played with it once. I\u2019d already had a chance to examine it closely, so it was no longer a mystery to me. Do you see the analogy here? Let\u2019s recap: a man becomes disinterested in every woman he dates, once he gets to know her, or once she dares to contradict him; it is a clear sign of immaturity and whim plus (I\u2019m guessing) a \u2018healthy\u2019 dose of narcissism. The same behaviour could also be caused by certain medications (SSRI/antidepressants.) Whatever the cause, the result is the same: not being able to maintain focus/not able to discern between his wants and desires. Clearly he is looking for a one-night-stand type relationship, and the woman is not being considered for her personal/character values, but simply chosen for her sexual attractiveness. I think the answer is in your question. You got mad and you corrected him. You\u2019re seeing an adult man, and most are good with disagreements, but it\u2019s not acceptable to treat a man like a child - getting mad and correcting him? There\u2019s another, better way to communicate. You have to understand that. I was hoping for help with the \u201cassignment\u201d from my therapist. Ivanka got the idea. I\u2019m guessing the question wasn't worded properly. As a male, I really have wanted a solid relationship with a woman. I used eHarmony principally because meeting women randomly (in person) rarely worked for some reason. I always selected women that met a specific criteria, pursued them more as \u201cselling\u201d myself and was \u201csuccessful\u201d 92% of the time with 30+ women I met online. After a few weeks you find out how awful their ex was, past\\current money or health issues, their kids learning or discipline problems and worse yet criticizing me for this or that. That absolute passion based on attraction is lost and never comes back.",

The whole of our family was at his place. At night we cousins decided to sleep together. At around midnight, he grabbed me, and started rubbing his cheek against mine. I didn't understand anything, absolutely nothing. All I did was ran to my parents\u2019 room. Now, fast forward, few months back, (that time I didn't understand anything and thought it to be a weird dream and let it go), we are in same city, have become pretty close to each other, like buddies, we meet occasionally, but this time, he tried all that all over again, grabbed me, tried to kiss me, not once but many times, inspite of me stopping him, telling him to stay, pushing him, he just tried. I escaped anyhow, that was terribly  shocking  for me. I was in a state, which I cannot just define. Now we are no one to each other. I regret trusting him back and loving my  brother  this much. What has been the best decision you've made in your life? What is the one thing you regret doing or not doing the most in your life? Do some doctors regret becoming doctors? Why? How common is this? Did anyone ever regret going to IISc? What does it feel like to regret not having kids? Before, i answer this, i want to clarify one thing, does the question concern as to whether anyone in my life regret the decision i made in the past or was it if I regret the decision i made in the past? i am answering to my latter understanding and perception of your question. A lot many regrets. In fact, i used to rewind them in my head countless times and in the process, i lost myself and was into depression. but, then I realized that i was not the same person who took the decision back then, if I knew back then that my decisions would just waste all my hard work away and that it wasnt a smart move to take, i wouldn't have taken it in the first place. so, there i am as a new person after the darkest nights of my life, this time as a different person and at a different point in life altogether. Yes I do regret a decision I have made in past it was regarding my career. I always wanted to be like my elder sister and in that race I lost myself. I could have been anything in the world I wanted but becoming a doctor just like my sister became a prestige issue for me so here I am can't be a doctor and my ego won't let me be anything else so here I am with nothing on my side not a career or a person to tell me its okay. It's okay to fail but don't stop trying\u2026. No one!",

Everything is inside you, so is happiness and sorrow. You become what(ever) you think. Let your mind control your thoughts and not thoughts your mind. Nothing is permanent, everything is temporary. Start loving yourself, there is a reason you are here in this world. Find the reason. There are many good things to come by, think about your parents and think about your dependants. You do not have to eradicate yourself, when the time come, nature calls. At that time even if you want to live, you do not have options left over. So is the case with every one. What do you want to eradicate from this world? How can we eradicate terrorism from the world? How can terrorism be eradicated from the world? What is the best way to commit suicide? I find myself not fit for the world, what should I do? Brother I know what you are going through. Life sucks, the mere existence of yourself becomes unbearable and you want to end this miserable life as soon as possible. But believe me whatever your circumstances past or present maybe, u can always shape your future, your future is entirely in your control.  \u201cyou are the master of your own fate\u201d.  Never let circumstances get the best of you, try to think positively and you can achieve wonders. Anyways We all are destined to die, we are mere mortals, we all are living on borrowed time, when it runs out we have to die. Their is no escape from it, no one in this world is immortal. How you utilize thus borrowed time defines you. So I suggest you to start thinking positively and do not give heed to these negative thoughts of yours. Believe in yourself. \u201cHow can I eradicate myself from this world?\u201d Are you hoping for suicide recommendations/developing a plan or motivation to keep living? If its recommendations, sorry, I won\u2019t help you, but google I\u2019m sure has a myriad of ideas. Is it motivation to keep living? I can\u2019t give that to you either. It\u2019s difficult to believe, but you may change your mind when you are feeling better. I do know, Its impossible to love anything without first loving yourself. Step one in beginning to love yourself: tell your doctor you are feeling suicidal and need help right away. Your doctor can help you more than strangers on the internet ever could. Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you. They\u2019re either lonely or they're missing somebody. They are in love with someone they probably shouldn't be in love with. They have secrets you wouldn't believe. They wish and they dream and they hope, and they look out the window whenever they\u2019re in the car or on a bus or a train and they watch people on the streets and wonder what they've been through. They wonder if there are people out there like them. They\u2019re like you, and you could tell them everything and they would understand. And right now, they\u2019re sitting here reading these words, and I\u2019m writing this for you so you don\u2019t feel alone anymore... x) You are not alone in having this kind of feeling. So this is definitely not something unique. Have you always felt like this? Like since forever? Since you were a kid? I don't think so. So try to find out when did these feelings begin to arise. Try to understand the root cause. Whenever this thought of hatred arises, acknowledge that thought. Like this - oh here we go again. One more thought of hatred. I hate that cat crossing road. But why do I hate that cat? It hasn't harmed me in any way. Can I make a list of reasons? Do the above. Slowly you will start observing your thoughts and you will stop reacting to them.",

Also there is this question \u201cHow was BITSAT 2017?\u201d . Here I found the experience of students about different subjects. So, you\u2019ll surely get an easy paper that 2016. There is this kind of situation , Subject wise Maths  - 40-41/45 Easy \u2026.  Rest require a bit hard trick and understanding. Chemistry  - 36\u201337/40 Easy \u2026.  Rest A bit Fact Based (Non- common learning points). Physics  - 35\u201336/40 Easy \u2026.  Rest include derivable parts or in between equation to find solution. Logical  - 9/10 Easy as always. English  - 15Q Nothing can be said\u2026 it totally depends on individual. So, overall you can see BITSAT 2017 is easy. Yeah, it doesn\u2019t mean cutoff will increase coz the intakes in alot courses are increasing and a B.E. Elec. n Communication is also introduced. So, the cutoff that should have extra-increase due to easy paper would get equalized by this increase in intake.Also, mind that the normal increase in cutoff would be there. Wish you all a very good luck. Be positive. Be confident. Never lose hope. Time is less. But Don\u2019t panic. That\u2019s the key. Tip  - Don\u2019t run for all English questions or BONUS Questions. Try to be accurate with whatever you mark. Pro Tip- If you do 100 , all correct . Your score 300. If you do 140 , but you did 30 wrong, you\u2019ll get 300. Last year\u2019s entry was 297. So you won\u2019t clear cutoff of Entry. For all average guys , go for around 128-130 attempted and high accuracy like at least 115\u2013120 correct. You\u2019ll get 320-380. Now the game is yours. One day before Exam - Ravi Sadhwani's answer to What should I do just a day before the BITSAT exams? How is BITSAT 2017 compared to 2016? Was BITSAT 2015/2016 tougher than the previous year\u2019s BITSAT papers? Can I get BITSAT 2016 paper? How do I study for BITSAT? What is the cutoff for BITSAT 2016, and the expected cutoff for 2017? There are always different papers for different exam dates and different papers for different slots. So,in some cases the 2016 paper may be easy than the 2017 paper, whereas in some cases the reverse may be true. P.S. My exam is on 20th.. I will try to give my best\u2026 :)",

Now question is that when this force is okay to implement ? When it promotes liberty (individualism and liberalism)-  Liberty of individuals + Liberty of community When it promotes equality -  Socialism is example of that. Extreme version of socialism is communism Force is never okay -  Anarchism which demand total abolition of State. Lets have look on Monarchy. There are two types monarchy. Absolute Monarchy -  A single family holding power and ruling from generation to generation citing a divine right to rule. Example- Saud family of saudi arabia Constitutional Monarchy-  Royal families authorised by a nation\u2019s constitution to be a nominal head of State. They are powerless because Parliament and elected leaders run the show. Example- UK, Japan, Spain, Sweden etc. From the democratic view one should has to classify democracy in three parts. Democratic Socialism -  A peaceful & democratic way to achieving socialism favours a gradualist approach. Example- France Representative Democracy-  People rule themselves indirectly. Qualify leaders are elected to rule. Example- Italy and India Direct Democracy-  People rule themselves direcrly. All decisions are made by citizens not by elected representatives. Example- Switzerland. In today\u2019s world  Democratic society  are stable and usually has no revolts because people feel they are getting a fair treatment and can change things that they don\u2019t like. Is monarchy better than democracy? Which is better, a monarchy or a republic? What is the current situation in Oman? Is it a monarchy or a democracy? Which is better between democracy and monarchy? Write your answer with complete explanation What do a monarchy and a democracy have in common? To question which one is BETTER is a simple thought. On theory, in logic I mean, in monarchy it all depends on the emperor. If some real bad ass crowned, people may suffer. Does it mean democracy is better without any problems? Nope. Some real bad asses were actually elected in history somehow, which led to totally disaster as well. IMHO, it\u2019s just about which one is suitable. Funny thing: at Blackrock College in Dublin, half-American Eamon DeValera turned in a paper arguing against democracy in Ireland, saying that monarchy was more stable. It wasn't much later that he joined the Irish Nationalist movement, specifically Sinn Fein, and started himself on the path that ultimately led to his being \u201cthe last President of an independent Ireland,\u201d an observation he made himself on leaving that office. Not much in the way of relevance, but it shows you what can happen when you think you're sticking to your principles. Define \u201cbetter.\u201d If you want a system where the people have a voice in how taxes are spent and what laws they live under, and where there\u2019s a greater guarantee of a multitude of ideas for addressing problems, then go democracy. If you want a system where leaders are chosen based on who their parents are, go monarchy.",

When you successfully defend your Master\u2019s thesis in this plan, you automatically progress into the Ph.D. program. Bachelor\u2019s at one institution, Master\u2019s at a second, but the most successful Master\u2019s students are invited to continue on into the Ph.D. program at that same school. Uninvited students have the option to apply elsewhere. Of these approaches, #4 is probably the most common in the US. It does vary a lot by country, though - the European model is dramatically different. All of them will have you in school for roughly 4 years taking Bachelor\u2019s-level content, 2 years taking Master\u2019s-level content and writing your thesis, and 3-years taking doctoral-level content and writing your dissertation. So the total time you spend is roughly the same regardless of path. That\u2019s important to note, because in path #2, you still take \u201cMaster\u2019s level\u201d classes - you just don\u2019t get a degree (although you also usually don\u2019t need to write a Master\u2019s thesis).

        "a": "The ransomware, called \"WannaCry,\" is spread by taking advantage of a Windows vulnerability that Microsoft released a  security patch  for in March . But computers and networks that haven't updated their systems are at risk. Here Are Some Easy Steps To Protect Your Machine And Secure Your Files From Falling Hostage To Online Scammers. 1. Patch You Operating System First of all, if you haven't patched your Windows machines and servers against EternalBlue exploit (MS17-010), do it right now. Following the installation, make sure to reboot the system. In general, patching your system and installing regular Microsoft updates should secure an average PC user from unwanted vulnerabilities. 2. Beware Of Emails Just as with many other ransomware, it can penetrate the system not only through a Windows vulnerability, but also through the \u201cspray-\u2018n\u2019-pray\u201d phishing attack, which involves spamming users with emails that carry a malicious attachment. The attackers can also lure a victim to click on a URL where malware will be ready to crawl into your machine. 3. Backup Your Files It is highly advised, in order to protect yourself from being held hostage to data thieves, to create secure backups of important data on a regular basis. Simply backing up is not enough though, as physically disconnecting the storage device is required to avoid it being infected with ransomware as well. Cloud storage is another option to use, but it makes your data vulnerable to all other kinds of attacks. 4. Get An Anti Virus Install an anti virus if you don't have it already. Also make sure that you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your system, and most importantly, always browse the Internet safely.

What are the best ways to protect my computer from viruses/attacks etc.? What's the way to protect yourself from Ransomware? How do I decrypt my files that are encrypted by RANSOMWARE (.CERBER FILES)? Take precautions to overcome ransomware before it overcomes you We are in middle of ransomware attacks that are happening all over the world, so to prevent it up, we asked our IT Manager Neeraj Sharma to share some precaution tips and techniques, have a look: Don\u2019t open any suspicious link on the internet. Suspicious links can have following traits: 1. They seem to be different as they might have numbers or special characters in place of alphabets. 2. They come from Unknown sources. 3. They appear as blank or unreadable. Never open unknown google docs link. If you see anyone sending you a google doc Link, no matter how tempting it looks DO NOT OPEN IT. In recent days, many spam attacks have been triggered via google docs so if you receive google doc or google drive link from an unknown source do not open it. Never responds to emails which have unknown attachments from an unknown sender. Do not respond to Emails that contains unknown attachments or which may come from unknown email sources. This is the most used targeting mechanism of hackers. Backup regularly and keep a recent backup copy on network share drive. Don\u2019t enable macros in document attachments received from email. Many ransomware attacks arrive in form of documents, and they ask you to turn on macros. Don\u2019t do it: Microsoft intentionally turned off auto-access of macros as a security measure. So remember, whenever you receive any document from unknown sender, SAY NO TO MACROS \u2013 SAY YES TO SECURITY Be cautious about unrequested attachments. Hackers who send malware in documents take advantage of your dilemma. If in doubt, leave it out. Antivirus is the ultimate lock. You do have to have a paid or licensed Antivirus working in your system I would recommend you to check for crypto attack protection for prevention of such ransomware attacks.For more data security tips, read our previous  blog: https://www.qdegrees.com/blog/itsecuritydatasecurity/ Protecting yourself from ransomware is a lot easier than you think.  The WannaCry global ransomware attack \u2013 everything you need to know  details all you need to know about the WannaCry ransomware, and how you can protect yourself from this, and similar, attacks in future. Hope this helps :) I think many people have answered this question. I have no different interpretation. Most people have tried their best to answer this question. Their efforts are appreciated. Follwing all those answers i will recommend you to stay up to date. Whenever you are using internet make sure access safely. Apart from these answers if you really want to prevent your computer from ransomware then read this article -  How to prevent your compouter from ransomware attack. In this article every thing is mentioned on detail and you will also get some site link through which you can save your computer data. Hope this answer satisfied you quest. ANSWERER  - Vikash Kumar 1. Back up your data The  single biggest thing  that will defeat ransomware is  having a regularly updated backup . 2. Show hidden file-extensions One way that Cryptolocker frequently arrives is in a file that is named with the extension \u201c.PDF.EXE\u201d, counting on Window\u2019s default behavior of hiding known file-extensions. If you re-enable the ability to see the full file-extension, it can be easier to spot suspicious files. 3. Filter EXEs in email If your gateway mail scanner has the ability to filter files by extension, you may wish to deny mails sent with \u201c.EXE\u201d files, or to deny mails sent with files that have two file extensions, the last one being executable. 4. Disable files running from AppData/LocalAppData folders 5. Use the  Cryptolocker Prevention Kit 6. Disable RDP 7. Patch or Update your software 8. Use a reputable security suite 9. Disconnect from WiFi or unplug from the network immediately 10. Use System Restore to get back to a known-clean state 11. Set the BIOS clock back You may also read:  https://lnkd.in/fdezWCH",

        "a": "Frederick the Great of Prussia. Remember that monarchs in the 18th and earlier centuries were already rich and entitled. The notion of personal gain would have seemed silly to them because they already commanded (if not outright owned) the entire wealth of the nation. Frederick, in 1740, seized the Austrian province of Silesia. It was a case of bold-faced aggression, and seemed doomed to fail because Prussia was a tiny state that could not afford to infuriate Austria, Russia, and France with such aggression. But it turned out that Frederick\u2019s Prussia was a better-run nation than the others, and he was a better military commander. He whipped his several enemies one at a time and forced them to accept his control of Silesia. And where Austria had neglected it, Frederick built roads, drained farmland, introduced good civil administration and religious tolerance and resettled thousands of people into areas that had been empty before. He described himself as the \u201cfirst servant\u201d of the people. The Silesians were glad to have him. Dictatorship: Has there ever been a good dictator at any point in history? If so which ones were good? Has there ever been a true communist country? Have two or more countries ever merged and become one nation? Who has been the benevolent dictator of your nation and what has he or she accomplished? What would you do if you were the dictator of India? I don't know that the words \u201cbenevolent\u201d and \u201cdictator\u201d can be put in the same question without incurring in some fatal historical mistake. Some will claim that some monarch or dictator of the past was good because he (or she) brought wealth to their nation but, were their people truly free, as we now understand freedom to be? Moreover, at who's expense did those dictators accomplish seemingly good things for their people? It can be argued that Hitler was good to most Germans because he got the country out of a deep recession that had many of them unemployed and begging for food. Yet, what was the cost of this \u201cbenevolence\u201d? Loss of all civil rights and most personal freedoms even for those same Germans that consequently saw him as a savior, enslavement and annihilation of many (including, of course, the Jews) and a world war that destroyed Germany and much of Europe. The same goes for Frederick the Great. What was so \u201cgreat\u201d about his wars of aggression? That he built some roads? I'd bet that if given a choice between being truly free or having the benefit of some structural development in their country, the Silesians would have chosen freedom. Similarly, what about Bonaparte? He unquestionably brought much wealth to France and even the world benefited from his intellect (the ideas postulated in the Napoleonic Code, to cite one, have since permeated the law not only in France, but in much of continental Europe and South America.) Yet again, at what cost? Multiple wars that cost thousands of lives and destroyed much of Europe, even when he was trying to rid Europe of the same monarchs I now criticize. There's no such thing as a \u201cbenevolent\u201d dictator. Human beings are not crafted to be good permanent rulers. As the saying goes, \u201cpower corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d Hence why democracy (despite all it's problems) is the best form of government we've tried so far. Can it be improved? Absolutely. But never with a dictatorship\u2026 No, but I'd suggest the closest to a possible answer would be Marshal Josip Broz Tito, the non-aligned Yugoslav Communist leader the Soviet Union hated and the rest of the world could do deals with. For all his reputation as a benevolent dictator and a unifier for post-war Yugoslavia, he was nonetheless a dictator with all that that entails. There are a number of benevolent dictators who made their countries better while exploiting the nations wealth not too much ) Some of these dictators include really unpleasant figures like Pinochet in Chile who presided over a number of economic reforms that left the country better. At the same time he obviously exploited the country quite a bit and persecuted leftist opposition as well as common people. Semi-dictatorial regimes in South Korea and Taiwan left their countries much better off developing their economies although in both cases with heavy support of the US. Now both countries are flourishing democracies. Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore was not a dictator but presided over not exactly democratic government leading the country to becoming one of the richest and most developed in the world. So there are plenty of good benevolent dictators but if the country wants to succeed long term it is usually a transitional period when painful economic reforms are done.",

        "a": "I guess that depends on what kind of math you suck at! Engineering focuses on calculus and differential equations, two mathematics fields that are far different than the math most people think of when they talk about the subject. Calculus and Diff EQ are basically variable algebra with some pattern recognition and application. So you do not actually use numbers normally until the very end when things are simplified, and most problems will require you to follow a simple formula or method to get to an answer. It is in memorizing and applying these formulas or methods that people have a hard time in engineering mathematics. That being said, no undergrad will be good at Engineering Mathematics when they get to their first courses, so you won\u2019t necessarily be at a disadvantage. I would say that to be good at engineering you need to be capable of surviving and using the following courses/information before you get to a college level class. Trigonometry Functions and Graph Theory (whats the equation of a line? how does a function work? etc) Pre-Calculus Algebra Everything else is sort of un-important I would argue. You will always have access to a calculator, so being able to like do long division or something is not at all what engineering math is about. It is about seeing a problem, and applying patterns and methods to it to get to near an answer. I study electrical engineering and I suck at math, what should I do? I am pretty good in programming, but my math sucks, how can I improve? I suck at math or anything with numbers unless it is physics. I want to be a physicist. What do I need to know about math or what is a good st... Do I have to be good at maths to do a PhD in engineering? How can I be great at math? \u201cSucking at math\u201d isn't a death sentence. You can learn to be good at math. When I stared college I wasn't very good at math and I got a degree in physics and math. You can learn anything if you put your mind to it. Short answer. Absolutely. You most likely don\u2019t suck at math, but more likely have had really crappy math teachers. Most of them are GOOD at math. Some are even stellar, but that rarely, if ever equates to good math  teaching  skills. All the other subjects can have crappy teachers, but you will still learn something. You just won\u2019t get the full benefit as with a great teacher. But with crappy math instruction you will FAIL, or worse learn a bunch of bad habits. Math is simply a bunch of rules\u2026. THAT NEVER change. The key to teaching math, is teaching the rules, not showing off how well you (the teacher) knows the rules. The key to learning math is recognizing which rule to use, and how. Here is a educational secret\u2026 If you show poor math skills in school. (Notice I did not say math aptitude) Especially elementary school, you will get tracked in the crappy teacher classes, all the way though high school. I watched this happen with all my kids. Plus I know a lot of math educators. All my kids had great math aptitude, but not all of them had great skills\u2026 My wife is a stellar teacher, and particularly at math. And can fix any kid that shows desire to improve. Go take some math classes at a junior college, and here is the BIG secret\u2026 DO THE HOMEWORK. All of it. Do not skip ANY math equation steps, no matter how confident you are of the answer in your head. WRITE it out. By the time I was in 3rd year calculus I was getting 100% on every test. The best engineer I ever worked with did all his homework in PEN. And get some tutoring. If you can pay for it, that is even better. \u201cCan I be a good engineer if I suck at maths!!\u201d Well!! Now your problem here may be of different types. It depends which type is yours. May be you like mathematics, but you can\u2019t do well in your exam beacause of some silly mistakes you do while solving and you feel so. May be you don\u2019t like mathematics at all. You have taken it forcefully in your 10+2. Now if you are in the first category then trust me it happens to most of us. You can improve yourself in this regard. But according to my point of view the second category students will be having hard time if they choose engineering. All the basic concepts of mathematics that we are taught till 12th starting from number system,set theory,trigonometry,calculus,co ordinate geometry, logic and reasoning etc. are of utmost importance in every step of engineering. If you are not having a good grip in these you will be having tough time. Now choice is yours. Best of luck!!",

        "a": "What  Eric Bittner  said is correct. Here\u2019s a Wikipedia article for  Hydrogen spectral series , which defines the  spectral lines  that are defined in each series.. You can also find a lot of reading material by searching for  spectral series on google . Here are two related videos from Khan Academy: Emission Spectrum Absorption Spectrum What does it mean for a Power Density Spectrum to have a peak at 0 Hz? If this is a time series spectrum, what does this imply for the series ... Why does a large number of lines appear in a hydrogen spectrum? What is the colour of the hydrogen series? Why is hydrogen so combustible? Why is the number of lines observed in the hydrogen spectrum very large? The various emission series in the H atom (and there are more 5, but only 5 has \u201cnames\u201d) are determined by the final state of the electron with wavelength given by [math]\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = Z^2Ry \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2}\\right)[/math] where  Z  is the nuclear charge,  Ry  is the Rydberg const. and  [math]n_f[/math]  and  [math]n_i[/math]  are the final and initial principal quantum numbers. The following diagram from Wikipedia is a useful reference for understanding the various spectral series. In essence, the Lyman series is any transition that ends in the n=1 orbital, the Balmer series, which is in the visible range, ends in the n=2 orbital, the Paschen series ends in the n=3 orbital, and so forth. The physical basis for this is ultimately given by the solution of the Schrodinger equation in quantum theory; however, Bohr gave the first physically justified derivation of the Rydberg formula about 100yrs ago. Bohr\u2019s model, however, misses a number of key features and was later replaced by a the general quantum theory we use currently. That is how it looks when you take a picture of it. The lines are clearly grouped like that. The specific series were also discovered in those groups before the unifying rule that giverned them all was discovered.",

        "a": "That is a hard to answer question directly but I can tell you some hints of how to find out. First look at google. Do a search and see the top results in your area. These shops know how to do SEO. Next call the shops you found and ask for prices. Rule of thumb the higher the asking price the better the shop. After getting prices ask for links from them all. The best shops should have fortune 500 clients or at least very well known brands in your area, and they should have links / proof they did the design for them. Call local business you know did websites and ask how happy they are with their websites. Generally people rave about good website developers and they remember and \u201chate\u201d the bad developers, local business may give you the low down on a top notch company that has terrible support. Remember you want a website (but you also want someone that can fix it when it goes down.) After all your research, look at the phone book. The heavy paperweight you use as a door stop now. If you can find one of these you might get more info about if a company if a new media or old media company from this. Is the business listed in the phone book as well as google. Look for ads. Good companies and big companies advertise. Rule of thumb the bigger the ad or billboard the more money the company is making, the better they are. Gut feeling. Everything in the world for research will not help as much as sitting down with a company and talking to them in person. If they answer all your questions, and you feel all warm and fuzzy all over, your probably in ok hands. Then again if you get a feeling of dread and looming question marks about price, scope, and talent on your project, or you get bad vibes from the company run. Finally don\u2019t let any company pressure you into a sale or cash on the spot. No good company is going to hardball / high pressure sale you. Good top companies understand website clients are long term relationships and they will approach things slowly. Getting your website done could take days, weeks or months, even years for huge projects, so remember a good company is going to treat you like a date not a client. They are going to approach things slowly and take their time getting things done. This is how enterprise companies approach websites so this is the best sign your working with a top notch company.

Political parties and mass media try to incite people to fight for the sole reason that it benefits Wall Street and special interests. Instead of fighting each other, Democrat and Republican citizens should join to confront their real oppressors. Here is my summary of Richard Gregg\u2019s concept of moral jujitsu. i learned it from reading Gene Sharp. I call it the power dynamic of nonviolence. If you can persist in the face of repression, you communicate to your adversary that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t so much bad, which it probably is, as much as it is ineffective. Then you begin to drive a wedge between the liberals and conservatives in power. The liberals moan and complain, \u201dThey\u2019re making us look so bad, can\u2019t we think of something to give them to get them to go away?\u201d The conservatives respond, \u201cNo, no, no. If we\u2019re a little more brutal, we can break them.\u201d Nevertheless, IF you can persist in the face of repression, you push that wedge further and further between the factions of power. Here\u2019s the key: the better the nonviolent discipline, the further the wedge will go for any given level of effort and sacrifice. The smoother the wedge, the further it goes. The rougher the wedge, the slower it proceeds. Use resistence sites http://www.manta.com/c/mx79tg6/c...",

        "a": "To many, the Universe appears to have a certain pattern about it. To me, the Universe has a select set of \u2018Laws\u2019 that govern what happen, one of those being the \u2018Law of Equivalent Exchange\u2019. Here\u2019s a quote by Hiromu Arakawa encompassing the concept: \u201cHumankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange.. The world's one, and only, truth. But the world isn't perfect, and the law is incomplete. Equivalent Exchange doesn't encompass everything that goes on here, but I still choose to believe in its principle, that all things do come at a price, that there's an ebb and a flow, a cycle, that the pain we went through did have a reward, and that anyone who's determined and perseveres will get something of value in return, even if it's not what they expected.\u201d And, speaking of Alchemy, there is another one of my favorite quotes from Paulo Coelho\u2019s book  The Alchemist : \u201cWhen you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\u201d I firmly believe in both of these concepts, but they don\u2019t necessarily explain  why  the \u2018right things\u2019 come at the \u2018wrong times\u2019. I believe the best answer to that is this: They don\u2019t . The \u2018right things\u2019 come exactly when they should come based entirely on what you\u2019ve done to make them a possibility. At least - That\u2019s what I\u2019ve found to be true. Here\u2019s one final quote for you by Ray Lewis, and something that has changed my life: \u201cThere will never be a point in your life \u2014 where it's the right time to do a great thing. If you're waiting for that perfect perfect moment, that perfect timing, it's not going to happen. You know what you have to do? You have to create the perfect time, and the perfect opportunity, and the perfect situation.\u201d Only once you  create  the perfect  time  can the \u2018right things\u2019 fall into place. Is the right thing at a wrong time a wrong thing? If God is not real, then from where do human morals come? What is something you get wrong, every single time you try to do it right? Why does the right one come along at the wrong time? What was the most wrong thing you did at the wrong time? When you have your youth, you only need enough money to survive; all the best things in life are free. When you get some money,  save  it; stop compulsively trying to get  more  money and continue to enjoy the same free things you did when all you had was youth. Then when you get old you will have enough money saved to relax and reflect on all the good times you\u2019ve had. You know what I\u2019ve learned? That\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just someone\u2019s opinion because they\u2019re waiting for the right moment for the right thing to occur. A lot of times youth has money and youth often squanders it; in old age they have no money and wail about what might have been. A lot of times a person never has any money at all in their life but makes the right time on their own. I don\u2019t have any money. I\u2019m 57. I never had any money as a child, I wasn\u2019t given an allowance. When I got married I had to be a housewife as the children we had were first, premature and needed close tending, then physically disabled and needed more tending. I had a husband who couldn\u2019t or would NOT hold a job. We went on and off welfare for 10 years. Often I sold almost everything in the house in yard sales and secretly gave the money to the landlord to keep us in the apartment. The husband never much seemed to notice the missing things as he was always going out, to look for work, he said, but upon getting a babysitter and following him, he was playing pool. What a fight we had that night! But I digress. Despite the lack of $ I always looked for the right time to do things. If someone was broken down, I would stop and help the stranger. If I heard an assault upon a person going on (we lived in a pretty nasty neighborhood and yes, it happened all too often) I would call the Police, then grab my staff or Chuks and run out screaming I was coming to beat the shit out of the attacker. I knew Korean Combat Tai-Kwan-Doe and was ready to use it. When we moved to Texas it was the same thing, only now the husband was in the Air Force. We neighbors with sick children banded together and helped each other no matter the time of day or night. It was the right thing to do, no matter that none of us had much money. If someone needed milk, we put change together and someone would run to the PX to get it. After moving to AK, getting a divorce and living on my own, it still was the same thing. No money? who cares. I carefully budgeted what I had, paid my bills and did the right thing by other people no matter what, if I could help. If I couldn\u2019t, I\u2019d try to help them get a hold of someone who could help. Even if the right thing was chewing someone out for the way they were treating their children, I did it. I once saw a man raise his hand to slap his crying baby and stopped him, swearing to call the cops if he hit her. We had a ferocious argument, the store sent out their security who did call the cops and lo, the man had a record and a warrant and was arrested. I was asked to stay with the baby until Mama arrived, with a female cop by me. She asked me why I did it and I said \u201cbecause it was the right thing to do.\u201d You have to MAKE the time for the right thing. If you see a homeless person, treat them to a takeout meal from a fastfood restaurant. That\u2019s making a right thing happen at the right time. If you see someone walking with a gas can in hand, try to pull over and ask if they could use a ride. Even just strike up a conversation with an old person in the grocery store! They may be lonely, even tho they\u2019re out shopping. Or go to a retirement home and visit in the common room. Do the right thing anytime and it\u2019s the right time, whether you have the money or not. It\u2019s just the right thing to do. Man gets against the nature if all these happen at once. Man can only flow with it but cannot do anything with it. Good that man did not find any technologies or mechanisms to change the seasons and if it happens his life span will come down to 30 years. Instead man can get these things more balanced with little money, little youth and little enjoyment. He can do this by falling in harmony with Nature. Then Nature will tune them accordingly. How to fall in harmony with nature? This question can be answered in many pages. But in short, we can say, if man can start recognizing the five elements and Nature which are not external to him (but more internal). If those cosmic energies can be recognized and respected, then they will tune the five elements within a person. Then he can have those balanced comforts. Loves Krishna",

Unless a doctor specifically prescribes one to treat a diagnosed deficiency or condition, there is no reason ever to take a supplement. Just eat a healthy diet. Save your money. If you think you have a health problem, see a medical doctor. Why doesn\u2019t Rhodiola rosea work for me? Why is Valium not working on me? Sleep Apnea: How well does rhodiola work to decrease fatigue from sleep apnea? What I do if PPI doesn't work on me for GERD? What should be done if Vidaza doesn't work? Rhodiola does a lot to relieve anxiety and stress and relieve fatigue for some people, but not for everyone. It could be this is not the supplement for you. If your difficulty concentrating is due to something other than being stressed out/fatigued there may be other options you need to consider that would work better. Obviously, you should see a doctor to determine if there is a healthy issue present that needs to be addressed, but medications are not the only solution to many problems. The first place I would look is your diet. What types of foods are you eating? For example foods with artificial dyes, hidden sugars etc. can and often do worsen the ability to focus and can even increase hyperactivity (If you are someone with ADD for example) Those who have intolerances to certain foods will also find that eating those foods produces \u201cmind fog\u201d and difficulty focusing. Without a bit more background it\u2019s hard to say. Do you have trouble sleeping? Are you dealing with anxiety or depression? Do you have racing thoughts? Are you perhaps bored with the tasks you are trying to concentrate on? So many things to consider and it\u2019s hard to know without more background. If you want to take a more natural route, you may want to consult with an herbalist and/or dietician to help you as well. Rhodiola has not been proven to work. Talk to a doctor about your diet and supplements. From my experience, it is often something that should be eliminated from the diet that solves the problem, not something that should be added.",

In any case, in India, like many other democratic countries, police can beat a citizen only while dibursing an unruly mob and he is part of that mob. In other case, if a person objects lawful arrest, police can use reasonable force to effect arrest. These two cases are lawful and police have the authority to do that. If the Police beat a citizen unlawfully, there are many recourses. Complain to superior officers. Take legal course through court. Approach authorities like police complaints authority, human rights commission etc. Take it before media. When did US police stop walking neighborhood beats, and why did they stop? Why are police officers allowed to lie to suspects in the US? How can I beat the police? Does the Indian Police have right to arrest me/abuse/beat for just arguing with them during code of conduct? Why is shoot-to-kill so frequent in the US police force? What? Something is missing from your question\u2026. Nevertheless, the beauty of American law enforcement is that there are remedies for those that feel they have been mistreated by the police. Many immigres have a negative view of \u201claw enforcement\u201d because the countries from the immigres left have corrupt or severely biased policing. The basic governing rules for criminal justice are found in the US Constitution regarding \u201cdue process.\u201d As a result every state requires a police agency to have a system in place to handle complaints. In the agency I worked for, it was called \u201cInternal Affairs.\u201d There are also local government offices; i.e. council members, mayor\u2019s offices, etc. There are state and federal offices you can complain to such as congress people, senators, etc. There are also avenues such as the tort law industry in which lawyers will take your case (if they think you have a case) and try to go for a monetary award as a remedy for what is perceived to be an injustice. But bear in mind the complaint process is heavily muddied with phony or exaggerated complaints of police abuse which is sad because legitimate complaints get watered down in the process. For example, I was was accused of \u201cexcessive force\u201d and all I did was place handcuffs on suspect (car burglar). The arrest was made without incident and was rather routine. Two days later I received a notice from my sergeant that a personnel complaint has been made against me for excessive force. Contact Naxalites of the area and let the police official be beaten to beg for mercy. Naxalites come for rescue, no one else. In Mumbai Mafias were collecting Phafta, but, in Delhi Police bodies collect Phata from Local vendors, Goons, Dons etc. General Public is not safe as the Police helps the Mafias or Dons in safe condition.

        "a": "A black hole is a place in space where  gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out.  The gravity is so strong because matter has been  squeezed  into a tiny space ( see  What Is a Black Hole? ). Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or \"stuff,\" in an object. Mass of Sun : 1.989 \u00d7 10^30 kg,  The  solar mass  (M\u2609) is a standard unit of  mass in astronomy and astrophysics. There are 3 types of Black-holes depending on their mass. 1.   Stellar mass Black-holes  : When a star burns through the last of its fuel, it may find itself collapsing . A low mass star with mass less than about 1.4 times the mass of our Sun collapse to become a white dwarf. Stars with mass 1.4 <M < 3.0 collapse to become neutron star ( Chandrasekhar limit - Wikipedia ). These are masses (1.4, 3 or >3) of the core after supernova explosion (See the end of the ans: P.S). T he 7 M_sun (ques) is the mass of the star at the main- sequence . See  Main sequence - Wikipedia  . Stars with more than 3.0 M_sun collapse to  black-holes . They have masses from about 5 to several tens of the mass of the sun. Until 2016, the largest known stellar black hole was 15.65\u00b11.45 solar masses. In September 2015, a  black hole of 62\u00b14 solar masses  was discovered in  gravitational waves  as it formed in a merger event of two smaller black holes. There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in the  Milky Way  (our galaxy). http://www.nature.com/nature/jou... 2. Supermassive black holes \u2014 the birth of giants: The largest black holes are called \"supermassive.\" These black holes have masses that are more than  1 million suns together . Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called  Sagittarius A . It has a mass equal to about  4 million suns  and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths. I am trying to search such two supermassive black-holes together at the center of the galaxies (  Rubinur, K  et al 2017). ZME Science 3. Intermediate Black- hole: mass in the range 100 to one million solar mass The detection of intermediate black-hole is rare. Recent study has revealed the possibility for the existence of midsize, or intermediate black holes (IMBHs). Such bodies could form when stars in a cluster collide in a chain reaction.  B\u00fclent K\u0131z\u0131ltan  et al 2017 have shown that there is evidence for a central black hole in 47 Tucanae with mass of  2300 solar masses. P.S : Here the mass limits ( Chandrasekhar limit - Wikipedia ) I have mentioned for black-hole or neutron star are the mass of the core after supernova explosion. The 7 M_sun (ex) is the mass of the star at the main- sequence. If a  main-sequence  star is not too massive (less than approximately  8  solar masses ), it will eventually shed enough mass to form a white dwarf having mass below the Chandrasekhar limit, which will consist of the former core of the star. For more-massive stars, electron degeneracy pressure will not keep the iron core from collapsing to very great density, leading to formation of a  neutron star ,  black hole . Is there a mass limit for a black hole? I mean what is the smallest possible mass of a black hole? Could a black hole be just a very large mass? What is the minimum amount of mass needed to create a black hole? How can a black hole have mass if it's a hole? Does a black hole exist in the universe? If so, what is the proof? No such thing, as the size depends on the accumulated mass and there is no average. However if you are classifying by relative size then, Stellar-mass black holes are typically in the range of 10 to 100 solar masses, while the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies can be millions or billions of solar masses. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, is 4.3 million solar masses. So I was confused by this for a while too. The important thing to remember is that we are talking about the core of the star, not the star itself. The star itself needs to be roughly 29 solar masses The answer is chandrashekar limit.it  Was given by an indian nobel laureate Subramanian chandrashekar. It says that a star with\u00a0 mass grater than 1.5 times that of our sun would collapse onto to its own gravity after sevaral stages and form into a Blach hole",

What you should do is to go through all the basic questions first, then have a look at the interview experiences of those companies who will be coming for campus recruitment in your college. Dont mug up everything, just understand the solution. Follow a good book  : If you have very less time for your preparation, I would suggest you a book :  Data structures and algorithms made easy by Narasimha Karumanchi . This is an awesome book to complete the basics\u200b within a short period of time. If you have enough time to prepare, this will be the best option:  Introduction to Algorithms is a book by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. Practice a lot  : Practice makes a man perfect. Practice is very essential when it comes to programming. Almost all companies take a coding test before the personal interviews. If you don't practice much, you may find it difficult to implement even if you know the logic behind the solution. I would suggest you to have a look at  Hackerrank  and  Codechef . These websites will provide you a clear view regarding this.

Easy\u2026\u2026.borderlines have no sense of self and fragile egos,I dont care in all honesty about generalizing here,but they for most part want to be the center of attention and the mere idea im presuming your/her kids actually like your new partner is like a spear through her heart,so naturally your gonna experience some bdp bullshit,chaos and drama in relation to your new wife\u2026and obviously this dynamic will continue unless you enforce some boundaries,easier said than done I know because I witnessed my previous bdp partner and her bullshit with 2 previous partners and their kids\u2026\u2026non stop drama and chaos\u2026.tragic.",

Because maximum question asked are from previous year only by conducting authority. Hope it helps. P.S- Sometimes you may feel frustrated, listen to good music in mean time and again kick start your study. Thanks & Regards, Vipin Can I get a rank below 100 in GATE 2017 , if I start studying now? What should be my strategy? How do I prepare for GATE 2015-CS and get a decent rank, now that only 1 month is left? I would like to join RLC GATE institution for my PhD admission preparation. Is that alone sufficient to get 2 digits rank? I'm a quick learner but right now I don't have any knowledge of my subjects. Can I crack GATE 2018 if I start my preparation now? How do I get AIR 1 in GATE CE 2017 if I start preparing now? As you mensioned you want to give Gate 2018, so you have roughly 1 year to prepare which is more than enough to turn the table. You just have to keep your faith in you and give your at most to get there. When you start studying, you will be remembering thing which was taught in B.Tech. (you just think you have forgotten everything but its just in back of your mind and need a push). Go through syllabus, check what you know and what you dont. Join coaching if possible (it will speed up the learning process). You are already good at maths and it is having a weightage of 15 marks in gate so this is good start for you. Try to make notes from the beginning, solve number of problems and previous years.  You can watch Nptel lectures if you like. Its never too late to make things right but i would not give you any fake assertion. As you have mentioned you haven't been in touch with your subjects so long , so it would be a bit difficult but if you can do your homework of basics of every subject of the discipline and for rest core subjects you can opt for a coaching institute or video lectures , it would provide you a platform to start over. And lastly as as student myself I would say rather than focus on rank you need to focus on your subjects . it would come as a result of your hard work and knowledge of the subjects. all the best thanks for A2A Yes! And I am counting on your statement \u201cI am good at Maths!\u201d. Your AIR in GATE (for that matter any exam) is decide by: you knowledge/concepts ability to apply concepts to solve problems ( new/fresh questions) \u201cperformance\u201d in exam hall which depends on your core character qualities like confidence, courage, tenacity, sense of time, risk appetite Role played by #1 (concepts) is very limited for 2 digit AIR.

This project costs approx $13.3 billion and completed within 4 years. The amount was invested to rebuild war-devastated European regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, make Europe prosperous. For the United States, the Marshall Plan provided markets for American goods, created reliable trading partners, and supported the development of stable democratic governments in Western Europe. Now, lets discuss to  Belt and Road Initiative China already did a revolution in cheap manufacturing, so they need bigger market for their product. Hence, the countries from which one belt-one road is passing through, their market will be over-captured by Chinese goods. How China's 'Belt and Road' Compares to the Marshall Plan Marshall Plan stated that European countries being aided should accept U.S. investment and import U.S. goods. Over time, the U.S. dollar has become a tool for stability. China is also seeking to increase the international use of its currency. The endpoint of OBOR is located in Europe. It shows that China wishes to intensify relations with traditional U.S. allies in Western Europe, which in turn undermines U.S. influence in the region. India position between all these drama. India is pushing its own  North\u2013South Transport Corridor Japan is expected to join the Indian foray into the expansion of Iran\u2019s Chabahar port and the adjoining special economic zone. In eastern Sri Lanka, India & Japan are expected to jointly expand the strategically located Trincomalee port. They are also likely to join hands to develop Dawei port along the Thai-Myanmar border. Declining Power: Presently, China has a strength of $10.87 trillion where as India has $3 trillion. It is expected to overcome China by 2050. China experienced a meteoric rise in its economy, reaching years of continued growth in excess of 10 percent. Those days are over. China\u2019s most recent quarterly growth was just under 7 percent, with projections continuing to decline over the next decade and beyond. Sustaining the growth of China\u2019s military and economic power will become more difficult, and will soon begin a slow and potentially unrecoverable decline. And, then India will start playing her role. So, China will become superpower but will not be able to sustain for long. Thanks for reading such a long post. Is China the next India? Which country, if any, is poised to become the next superpower? Who should be the next superpower.? Is India the next China? Why is China a superpower and India just a competitor? I think India will be the next super power WHY NOT CHINA ?  : 1)China has a massive bubble economy  =It is on the verge of collapsing .It has for years manipulated and inflated the numbers in various provinces .It\u2019s actual growth rate is below 4% The Chinese government finally admitted that its economic data was made up Chinese Officials Admit They Faked Economic Figures 2)Less exports will hurt the already fragile Chinese economy  = Growth in many western countries are saturated .With the presidency of Trump ,the Americans are going to impose more import duties on Chinese products to help their economy and to create more jobs in America but these increased import duties will badly hurt the cheap export industries .Since Chinese depends on their exports and has a major share on their G.D.P ,declining exports will make the Chinese government to cut spending on social welfare Trump hikes import tariffs=less demands from Americans=less exports from China=less demands for local manufacturing in China=less profits and revenues for Chinese industries=more job loses= more stimulus measure=less welfare spending . China posts worst export fall since 2009 as fears of U.S. trade war loom China Has More To Lose Than the U.S. Under a Trump Administration 3 )Aging population of China  =Less workforce Because of the one Child policy ,the growth rate and demands are going to go down ,With more and more people joining the above 70 camp ,the welfare spending and pension programes will dent a huge in the already dwindling reserves of the communist government China\u2019s Twilight Years China's Aging Population Becoming More Of A Problem 4)China\u2019s ghost cities Kangbashi  New Area, a district of  Ordos City , was intended to house one million people, but soaring property prices and lack of infrastructure deterred residents of Ordos  from relocating to the newly built-up area, and it now stands largely deserted.

(human development , education and internal peace is not directly associated with term superpower.) Just google and it is easy to find various data, reports and graphs to compare the above parameters among different major countries. Also, existing value, growth rate and future expectations can be shown by various charts, graphs and facts. In military might, US is only country which has commands distributed into globe zones and not in national zones. It reflects the meaning that US has direct planning and preparedness to fight all kinds of war at virtually any place in the world. The technical advancement and innovation of US is known to world. US military expenditure is more than the same of next 12 countries combined together!!! India is not like Russia (better say USSR, before 1991) which had highly centralized command and a will to invest highly in military strength. India is not like China which has capacity to invest heavy money for defense import and developments. Read in detail at  Who will be next superpower ? India or China Technically China is already a superpower, (permanent veto member of the UN) and India is becoming a super power, in terms of military strength, naval capacity, army reserves, nuclear warheads, GDP, and so on.

You pick a character or two based on the meaning you want to convey, so the possibilities are endless, and has a high probability of being unique. Common names used for women usually invoke images beautiful things like a flower, for example, \u6885 (m\u00e9i), or plum blossom. Another way to indicate femininity is using characters with the \u201cwoman\u201d radical, or \u201c\u5973\u201d . For example, \u5a9a (m\u00e8i), it means charming or attractive. The only female Chinese emperor\u2019s name was \u6b66\u5a9a (\u5a9a was given to her by the emperor). You can be straightforward and just use beautiful, or \u7f8e (m\u011bi). Madame Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s name was \u7f8e\u9f84, meaning beautiful age or beautiful years. You can choose characters based on sound. If your name is May, you can choose any of the above, plus a lot of other characters. Like \u59b9 (m\u00e8i), or sister. However, there really is no convention.

Chinese naming on the other hand is like capitalism. Depend on parents education level and knowledge in Chinese literature and the time they spend, the name could be extremely simple or extremely sophisticated. few names i consider as sophisticated, for example: \u6797\u5915 Lin, Xi The plain meaning of the first name \u5915/Xi means evening/sunset. But if you combine the first name and last name you get the single chinese character: \u68a6(First name at bottom and last name at top), which means \u201cdream\u201d. Xi Lin is a Chinese lyricist famous for his dreamlike lyricis. \u90ed\u5a49\u5a77 Guo,Wan Ting or Guo,Wanting People pick english names for themselves, but in case you insist to use Chinese pronunciation translated English name, you end up with pronunciation translated spelling. \u5a49\u5a77 are two beautiful feminist Chinese characters, but surprisingly the pronunciation translated spelling in english is already a fascinating term. Since she is a singer and song writer, i consider her English namr is as fascinating as her song. \u5f20\u4e00\u5c71 Zhang, YiShan or Zhang,Yishan the first name: \u4e00(means \u201cone\u201d)\u5c71(means \u201cMountain\u201d)\u2026these two characters are super easy and commonly used in daily life, they are so simple that they should are among te first 10 characters Chinese kids learn in kindergarten. But that simplicity is what set it different from the rest, and if you think carefully it actually could from traditional chinese philosophy of naturalism and taoism. yeah, one mountain, i can already picture a wise old monk preaching about nature and relationship between the universe and human. i personally think if you want a meaningful chinese name, picking characters with good meaning is important, but the meaning or story behind the name is equally important. Parents name their kids because of something, and i believe every chinese kid has asked their parents the question, \u201cwhy im called XXXX?\u201d Before i paint the picture too rosy, i want to assure you that a majority of chinese population have mediocre names. Lol My first name means shining, because an augur said i lack \u201cfire\u201d (One of five elements) energy and my first name have to be fire-related to fill up the breach. A quite common traditional naming practice in China. You can go after complex characters for sure. I have a friend whose name is \u9648\u5929\u61ff, the third character is complex that i guess most people cant write it. I have a African American teacher in high school in NYC. He told us that when he was in China his name is \u767d, so Mr.White. Its kinda fun if racism is not considered. So beside the characters themselves there are so many other factors could be considered or tricks could be played. If you are a english speaker without chinese background, i would recommend you to think about the story or meaning behind the name before you go pick characters. And then, follow the rule of simplicity. I have seen so many people get \u201ccool \u201d chinese characters tattoo. One famous chinese joke about Justine Bieber is that he got a tatoo of \u201c\u4ece\u5fc3\u201d, which means follow your heart. But if you combine vertically you get \u6002, which means coward or frightened. There are so many that it's impossible to name all. The following are my recommendations: \u82ac (fen) - frangrance or sweet scent \u6167 (hui) - intelligent \u6dd1 (shu) - kind and gentle \u654f (min) - agile \u7075 (ling) - spiritual or clever \u5b3f (yan) - lovely \u7434 (qin) - a type of musical instrument \u6069 (en) - kindness or merciful \u5609 (Jia) - fine, good, praise worthy \u6615 (Xin) - dawn Thanks for A2A. There are too many to be listed here. My suggestion is to look for characters with these radicals: \u7389, \u5973, \u8279.",

        "a": "TDN is an effective therapy to treat muscular tension and spasm which commonly accompanies conditions such as arthritis, nerve irritation, muscular strain, ligament strains and herniated discs. WHAT IS TRIGGER POINT DRY NEEDLING (TDN)? TDN is the use of solid filament needles inserted through the skin and into the muscle to release painful myofascial trigger points. Dry needling results in the deepest tissue release allowing for improvements in movement and pain. It is called \u201cDry\u201d Needling because there is no solution injected as with a hypodermic needle during a flu shot. With Dry Needling, the needle itself and the effects it produces within the tissue is the treatment. When an injury occurs from repetitive use or acute trauma, inflammation will be produced from the damaged tissues. The damaged tissues will also go into a protective tension state or contracture to guard against further damage from utilizing the injured tissue. This contracture and inflammation inhibit microcirculation which limits both the oxygen rich blood reaching the injury and the waste products leaving the injury. The injury site becomes hypoxic (decreased in oxygen) which stimulates the body to produce fibroblasts, a cell that produces fibrosis or scar tissue. This fibrosis and scarring builds up around the muscles and tissues limiting the tissues ability to fully function (lengthen/shorten) and can also cause compression and irritation of nerves (such as carpal tunnel syndrome) \u2013 all of which inevitably lead to biomechanical disturbances in gait and function. TDN uses a small, solid filament needle which is inserted in a contracted painful knotted muscle to create a local twitch reflex which is both diagnostic and therapeutic as it is the first step in breaking the pain cycle as research shows will decrease muscle contraction, reduce chemical irritation, improve flexibility and decrease pain. When a needle is inserted into muscle it will also produce a controlled lesion and will cut between three to fifteen thousand individual muscle fibers. The body considers the needle as a foreign invader and will activate the immune system as a response. The cut muscle fibers also produce an inflammatory reaction that your body will respond to not just locally but all over the body to reduce inflammation systemically. \u201cI appreciate Active Spine & Sport\u2019s commitment to excellence, dedication to healing, ability to listen intently to the patient and the patient\u2019s body, determination to keep up with their continuing education, and desire for all patients to move freely and without pain in order to stay active and healthy. I would not go anywhere else; full stop. \u2014 A H MECHANICAL EFFECTS Dry Needling may mechanically disrupt a dysfunctional motor end plate Needling results in a Local Twitch Response (LTR) The LTR results in an alteration to muscle fiber length as well as having an inhibitory effect on antagonistic muscles NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS Baldry (2001) suggests that dry needling techniques stimulate A-nerve fibers (group III) for as long as 72 hours post needling Prolonged stimulation of the sensory afferent A-fibers may activate the enkephalinergic inhibitory dorsal horn interneurons, which implies that dry needling causes opioid mediated pain suppression Another possible mechanism of dry needling is the activation of descending inhibitory systems which would block noxious stimulus into the dorsal horn The LTR may also utilize the excessive ACh in the tissue which previously was triggering increased firing of localized fibers CHEMICAL EFFECTS Studies by Shah and colleagues (2001) demonstrated increased levels of various chemicals at sensitized motor end plates such as: Bradykinin, Substance P and CGRP (regulator of Calcium and Phosphate balance). These chemicals were reduced immediately post a LTR. CGRP enhances the release of ACh from nerve terminals, which results in increased ACh receptors at the neuromuscular junction Needle penetration will cause micro-trauma and micro bleeding (localized inflammation) and hence the introduction of PDGF into the area to help promote healing IS TRIGGER POINT DRY NEEDLING ACUPUNCTURE? No, Trigger Point Dry Needling is based on Western medical research and principles, whereas acupuncture is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine. The main similarity is that the same sterile, disposable solid filament needles are used. Although Dr. Mulhall is a Fellow for the International Association of Medical Acupuncture (FIAMA) and also practices acupuncture, he was trained through two separate organizations (The American Dry Needling Institute and KinetaCore) to provide detailed and specific TDN therapy and each therapy is a separate and distinct in their methodology, perspectives and practices. WHAT TYPES OF CONDITIONS CAN TDN ASSIST? Neck/Back Pain Shoulder Pain Tennis/Golfers Elbow Headaches Hip and Gluteal Pain Knee Pain Achilles Tendonitis/Tendonosis Plantar Fasciitis Sciatica Muscular Strains/Ligament Sprains Chronic Pain Athletic Performance FDM DOES TDN HURT? You may or may not feel the insertion of the needle. The specific needle manipulation is intended to produce a local twitch response that can elicit a very brief (less than a second) painful response some patients describe as a deep ache or cramping sensation. Again, the therapeutic response occurs with the elicitation of the local twitch response and is a desirable reaction. WHAT CAN I DO TO PREPARE FOR MY THERAPY? Eat a light meal 1-2 hours prior to your visit and wear loose, comfortable clothing that can be rolled up or down to access your areas of concern with the greatest ease. WHAT CAN I EXPECT AFTER TREATMENT? We are looking to get improvements even from the first visit such as increased range of motion, ease of movement and decreased signs/symptoms. Many patients report being sore after the treatment in both the area treated and the area of referred symptoms. Typically this soreness lasts between a few hours and two days and there is occasional bruising. Soreness may be alleviated by applying ice or heat to the area and performing specific stretches for the treated muscle. Conventional Sprained Ankle Treatments Doctors sometimes perform an X-ray on an injured ankle to ensure no bones are broken. Oftentimes it\u2019s possible to diagnose a sprained ankle based on symptoms and appearance. Your doctor will look for signs of ankle swelling. She will talk to you about your symptoms and how the injury happened. She may also move around or press the ankle to determine how limited your range of motion has become. Once diagnosed, your orthopedist or doctor\u2019s recommended treatments for the sprained ankle can include: Taking an over-the-counter pain killer. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen can help initially control pain and swelling. Resting and icing the foot. Use compression dressings, bandages or ace-wraps to keep your ankle still. Elevate your ankle by placing it above the level of your chest, ideally for about the first 48 hours. Improving your form when exercising (more on this below) and wearing more supportive shoes with inserts. Changing your sneakers/shoes when exercising is usually the first step, which might include wearing orthotic inserts for support. Orthotic inserts used in sneakers or shoes consist of arch support and sometimes a lifted heel. They control the rolling-forward motion of the foot. They can take pressure off the small toes and help stabilize the ankle. Depending on how severe your supination problem is, your doctor might also recommend physical therapy. Physical therapy can \u201creteach\u201d your muscles and joints how to distribute your weight in a healthier way, from your feet upward. 7 Natural Sprained Ankle Treatments 1. Rest & Icing Rest is vitally important for the healing process of any injury. It\u2019s also one of the basic sprained ankle treatments. After you initially heal, you should start moving the ankle again to reduce stiffness. In the first 1-2 days after the injury, try to ice the ankle to keep swelling down. Use an ice pack or even a frozen bag of veggies. Press it against a cloth and the ankle for about 15-30 minutes at a time. Ideally, do this several times per day. Keep strong heat away from the affected foot and be careful not to apply ice directly to your skin. Plan to rest the area for at least about 72 hours/3 days post-injury. Experts recommend a \u201cthree-phase\u201d treatment program for optimal healing. It can take just 2 weeks to complete for minor sprains. It may take or up to 6 to 12 weeks for more severe injuries. Specific rest time will depend on your symptoms and ability to heal. Once you\u2019re back on your feet, two of the best exercises are swimming in a pool and performing band exercises. You can also try cycling or using an elliptical when you\u2019re ready; it\u2019s probably best to ask your doctor before doing so. 2. Fix Your Form Those who have poor posture and form when walking or exercising are at the highest risk for ankle sprains. This is especially true in the case of over-supinating the foot. Supination describes the rolling  outward  motion of the foot, therefore over-supinators don\u2019t roll their root inward enough when moving forward. Excess supination is also called \u201cunderpronation\u201d \u2014 since supination is the opposite of pronation of the foot (rolling  inward ). ( 7 ) Both oversupination and overpronation also put too much stress on the bottom or outside edges of the foot. This often leads to leg pains or  common running injuries . Those with high arches (the opposite of \u201cflat feet\u201d or collapsed arches) and tight Achilles tendons tend to be under-pronators/supinators. ( 8 ) In addition to spraining your ankle, this common type of poor form can cause other injuries. These include: \u201chammertoes\u201d (clawed toes), Achilles tendinitis, plantar fasciitis,  shin splints  and iliotibial band syndrome, affecting the knees. It also causes poorer performance due to general instability and weakness. Another problem is due to abnormal dorsiflexion of the foot. While supination describes the outward rolling motion of the foot, dorsiflexion describes the bending backward of the foot. Dorsiflexion decreases the angle between the foot and the ankle; in other words, it means the toes are lifting up and away from the ground, toward the ankle/body. ( 9 ) Proper dorsiflexion safely brings the knees over the ankles, such as when bending over, squatting or jumping forward. However, too much dorsiflexion is also problematic and leads to instability. Too much motion due to weakness in the muscles and joints of the feet can contribute to ankle rolling. Here are tips to help you stretch and strengthen the lower legs after your initial injury heals. They are sprained ankle treatments that will help correct your form and prevent future sprains: If walking or running fast, come to a soft landing. Land closer to the middle of your foot, instead of the back of the heel. Try to land with a mostly flat foot, attempting to avoid too much curving of the toes inward or outward. Slightly increase your cadence and potentially shorten your stride to keep proper form in the feet and legs. Run with upright posture through your back and stay relaxed. Gently stretch/mobilize the muscles in the legs prior to exercise and afterward. This helps break up adhesions and allows you to sustain proper form. You can use a  foam roller  on the floor. Position your body on top so the roller is under your calves, then move back and forth gently. Also, try massaging the fascia (soft tissue) in the bottoms of the feet with a tennis ball under the foot. Increase strength in your legs by doing exercises. Examples are crab walks (holding an upside down \u201cV\u201d with your body), calf lifts, squats, forward bends, and lunges. Stretch your lower legs as you lay on your back. Then lift the legs in the air and flex the ankles back and forth. Or, perform heel raises by placing your toes up against a wall, tilting the toes back towards the body. Use a resistance band (also known as  exercise band ) wrapped around the ankle to gently pump and improve ankle flexibility. ( 10 ) 3. Correct Your Posture & Stance Weak ankles prone to rolling can also put you at risk for other types of strains tied to poor posture. The muscles in the legs and feet get trained to push the foot away from the ground by using mostly the outer toes/pinky toes. These are weak areas of the feet, not capable of withstanding much pressure or weight. This can contribute to the formation of scar tissue in the lower legs. Once the legs are weakened, postural problems can extend up to the hips, pelvis and lower back. Using sprained ankle treatments to correct your posture and stance is key. I recommend working with a physical therapist or postural trainer. They can assess how you can better control compensations and reduce risk for injury. You may want to find an  Egoscue Posture Therapist  and/or see a Spinal Correction Chiropractic doctor (ideally from a clinic such as the Clear Institute) if you suffer from back problems. Weakness and back compensations can work their way down to the feet because the body is fully connected. This is why a full-body approach to correcting posture is best. 4. Lower Inflammation & Support Joint Health With a Collagen-Rich Diet Diet might seem unrelated to leg injuries, but your body needs nutrients to keep your muscles, joints and ligaments strong. There are several foods that make great natural sprained ankle treatments. Here are the top anti-inflammatory foods that can reduce swelling in a sprained ankle and support healing of damaged tissues: Sources of collagen.  Collagen  is the most abundant protein in the human body. It\u2019s needed to keep all types of connective tissue strong.  Bone broth  contains collagen and can help speed recovery. It can also complete healing of sprains, strains and ligament injuries. In addition to providing collagen, bone broth contains amino acids and many minerals. Clean lean protein. The body cannot rebuild stressed tissue without enough protein. Eat at least 3-5 ounces per meal from a  high quality, organic lean protein . A couple of options are wild-caught fish or grass-fed beef. Green leafy vegetables. Kale, broccoli, spinach and other greens are high in antioxidants, vitamin K and many minerals, which are essential for healing. Foods with vitamin C. Vitamins like C help rebuild collagen, an essential component of skin and tissues. Increase your intake of  vitamin C rich foods ,  including fresh fruits and vegetables. Good choices include citrus fruit, bell peppers, strawberries and broccoli. Foods rich in electrolytes like magnesium and potassium can help speed healing and reduce muscle pains. Examples include coconut water and bananas. Foods high in zinc. Zinc facilitates chemical reactions that rebuild tissues and support the immune system. To  increase your intake of zinc , add things like beef, pumpkin seeds and spinach to your diet. Antioxidant-rich foods. As you get older, if you\u2019ve been very active, or if you\u2019re under stress, free radicals will form. They can cause damage throughout the body. Free radicals are linked to many different signs of aging, stress and weakness. To prevent this damage include more  foods with antioxidants , which counteract free radicals. These include berries, greens, sea vegetables, cocoa, green teas, fresh herbs and other superfoods. I also recommend avoiding foods that can worsen or contribute to inflammation, signs of aging and slowed healing including: Alcohol. Alcohol promotes bone loss and inflammation. Too much sodium/salt. Too much salt prevents healing and removes critical nutrients from your body. Sugar and refined grains. Avoid these foods since they decrease immune function and provide very few nutrients for wound healing. Hydrogenated oils and fried foods. These foods increase inflammation and slow healing. Too much caffeine. Compounds in caffeinated beverages bind to calcium. This prevents absorption and limits healing. here\u2019s link for reference Your Top 6 Dry Needling Questions Answered (Western Musculoskeletal Acupuncture) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc...",

        "a": "First I will clarify your answer in two parts: Generally bearings are heated in two situations : When the bearing is mounted on the shaft its inner ring should be heated for easy mounting of bearing on the shaft. Again bearing gets heated in running condition which completely depends on his running condition parameters. The simplest way to mount the bearing with less or negligible effort is heated up bearing inner ring and immediately mount on the shaft. After cooling some time bearing will get interference fit on the shaft. The next reason for bearing heated up is its completely due to its running condition or its environment condition where the bearing is operated. The most common reasons for bearing heat generation in running conditions are: Either the lubrication film is destroyed or lubricant is drained out due to some reasons. Either bearing is pre loaded or too much tightly mounted on shaft so his internal clearance is destroyed which is in microns. The other reason for bearing heated up is bearing corroded , too much speed than bearing rating speed, electricity passed through bearing, etc. So clearly understand bearing heating probabilities and rectify your answer. How is heat build up controlled on the ISS? How can we heat up water without fire? What material will not heat up in microwave? Why do I get tired in the heat? Can I heat make up water in condenser? When you rub two surface on each other, the surface get heated due to the presence of friction. Like wise the bearing rollers produce friction on rolling on the race, hence the  rolling too produce friction (lesser compared to sliding contact) on the surface, continuous and high speed movement produce the heat, then the bearing got heated.",

What I can say is if you have constant chronic pain, what it will feel like is \u201cow\u201d, forget, \u201cow\u201d, okay now\u2026.and repeat. The pain isn\u2019t nearly as bad (try it for a month, then add in a whole lot of black pepper a couple of days in a row without cannabis, you\u2019ll know exactly the levels of pain that are being removed), mostly it is displaced, not dulled. That being said, everyone\u2019s experience with cannabis is uniquely different because cannabis unlike other products is geared to YOUR endocannabinoid system, how much your body absorbs, other medications you are on (or alcohol, tobacco, etc), how much you are taking, etc. There is no one size fits all when it comes to cannabis, which is why the drug companies have such a hard time trying to make it into a \u2018drug\u2019 they can sell. Marinol is synthetic and it is not a good comparison to how cannabis feels. I think a fair question is, \u201cDoes it work?\u201d The answer is, \u201cyes\u201d for 70% of those who try it for severe pain. How long does THC stay in the body? Is CBD legal in the US? How much is 100 mg of THC? Is CBD legal in PA? Is there THC in poppy seeds? My answer does pertain to a 2:1, but I am currently using a 1:1 CBD to THC softgel and I gotta tell you, it's an out-of-body experience at times. You get all of the good effects of both cannabinoids. Your pain will most likely disappear or be dulled for the duration of the high, sort of like an Indica but without the drowsines associated with it; this treatment of pain can be both mental and a physical. You will find the pain relieving properties of CBD very satisfying, and the THC will give a mild cerebral high with a general sense of well-being. If you can get your hands on the strain you refer to, I wholeheartedly recommend that you do so at your earliest convenience! Dreamy, euphoric, and relaxing according to my husband. It really depends on the strain, but in general a 2:1 ratio of cbd to thc will be pretty mellow, without any of the paranoia, since cbd downregulates the psychoactive effects of thc.

Both are fully different. Product Designing deals with the work flow of the projects. It can be a Software, Web Application and so on. You have to study and make things appear systematic and possible. Graphic Designing refers to knowing the art of selling. It deals with what customers it has, how it can be related to them, how easy they can understand what is being portraited. What are some examples of \u201cintentional\u201d bad design? What are the best examples of a really good design? Can I use the creation of man painting in a graphic I designed for one of my products? How can I be a product designer, if I have a product degree but graphic experience? Which one is better for freelance graphic designer? Behance or Designhill? This is like a Venn diagram. In certain cases, Graphic design is the same as the product you are selling, such as digital goods. In other cases, designing a building is completely different from designing a logo. You can\u2019t really compare them because they overlap. I have to say, however, while product design will earn you happier customers, Graphic design will earn you MORE customers, as new people are drawn in by the lure of the product. That\u2019s why several major companies are able to function, such as Beats, which makes headphones that you could assemble for 17$, but since they have an interesting design and \u201clook cool,\u201d most people will buy Beats. Online goods, a transaction for example, will only get bought if the icon looks good or is appealing. However, you aren\u2019t going to get very many happy customers if they buy your Beats only to find that they are horrible headphones. You won\u2019t get many repeat customers if you have bad product design. In the end, they are different fields of study and application that occasionally overlap. So neither wins. Well, they are both, in essence the same thing. Product design is a discipline within graphic design, much as book design or type design are. So neither are better. most definitely product design. there are far too many graphic designers who can not design their way out of a paper bag but seem to still be able to attract clients. there are far too few product designers, you may need to design many products before you get one that really hits, but hopefully you would have some ownership in the design and you could get paid admirably. there is no chance for that in graphic design and frankly it is not a highly valued skill by the public at large.",

Housing:  My rent was $650 living in Shadyside with three other people. That\u2019s pretty cheap for that area. Squirrel Hill is further from campuses, but is much cheaper. Some places can go for less than $400 per month but I don\u2019t know the state of the apartments there. In Oakland, you can expect about $500 if you plan on living with roommates. Food:  Being an architecture student, I didn\u2019t have much time to cook. I ate out a lot, and average meal was a little over $10. Sit down restaurants can be $20 per meal, and fast food can be as little as $4-5 (if you portion the meal into two lol). Groceries depends on the person, but if you shop at Aldi\u2019s, you\u2019ll get more food for cheaper compared to Giant Eagle, Trader Joe\u2019s, and Whole Foods. Transportation:  I used the bus a lot. CMU has free public transport for its students and faculty, and so does Pitt for undergrads at least. I can\u2019t speak for Pitt\u2019s graduate students. Uber is super accessible, but it does hit peak or double rates often as students use it night and day. Since everything near the campuses are quite close together, ride costs range from $5-$15. Of course, further you go, the more it will cost. Other: I\u2019m not a fashion person so I can\u2019t speak for that so much, but one thing I do know: Pennsylvania does not have tax on clothing. My student insurance through CMU cut down on medical bills a lot, and I went to UPMC once during my 5 years at school. I got my finger x-rayed and it was ~$90 with insurance. I usually went to student health services, and they patched me up okay. Some visits to the student health were no cost, other visits had me copay $5 or so. I went out a lot at night my last few years of college, and I had to budget for that haha. You can find cheap-ish drinks at bars near the schools, maybe $5 for well drinks? Tip: happy hour at Stack\u2019d is $1 shots on Thursdays. Also, if you\u2019re a clubber, cover costs range from $5-$10 in the strip district. You might find other retail purchases are slightly on the cheaper side in Pittsburgh compared to other big cities in the US (LA, NYC, Chicago, etc.) What is the cost of living in Lille for a student? How much is the cost of living as MIT student? How much does it cost to live in maxico as a student? How much would it cost a student to live in Paris per semester? How much will it cost to live in Milan as a student? Results - PhD Stipends There is an entry for Univ of Pitt. If you divide the stipend for a city by the living wage fraction, I think you get a conservative idea of what it would cost to share an apartment as you describe. Conservative because I think a frugal person could get by on less. The kicker, though, is health insurance. The US health insurance situation is an irrational nightmare. If you go to a hospital without insurance you are billed at several times the rate for an insured person. And the rates for insured people are high. Universities do have group coverage at, by US standards, reasonable rates, but it is probably necessary to research and call out as a line item in your budget. There was talk of ending the free bus passes for students - I don\u2019t know how this ended up. And there are parts of Pittsburgh with pretty high crime rates. The bus service tends to be limited to main lines. With many hills, narrow streets, and snow the city is not bike friendly. I\u2019m emphasizing warnings, but there are a lot of great neighborhoods. We\u2019d have moved into the city had we stayed in the area.",

        "a": "If you are asking this question you don't know enough to design your own kitchen. You should definitely get professional advice appropriate to the scope and budget of your project. If it's a simple upgrade to new appliances and cabinets you may do fine with the planning services of the supplier. Home Depot, Lowes, and (I think) IKEA offer such services. There are also specialized companies (at least in the US) that will do the whole thing for you including the design, supply, and construction. You need to be a bit careful with these as some are not the most ethical in their business practices. For a really high end, high style kitchen you may want to go with an interior designer. If the project involves extensive renovation or addition to the property you should get an architect. What are good ways for a graphic designer to design his/her own home without hiring an interior designer? Do new pubs hire interior designers? How can you hire an interior design student? Why should I hire you as an interior designer? Which is better, interior or graphic designing? The question is missing something. Let\u2019s assume, your location of Kitchen is finalized and your home is completed. Now you\u2019re having trouble selecting what type of cabinets and burner you need, because knowing your home is complete, all the technical pipelines (water, gas, electricity) are done. You can go to different stores where you can select kitchen cabinet designs along with tables and other kitchen accessories. I wouldn\u2019t recommend always hiring an Interior designer for the Job, when you can easily go to the market, chose the style according to your liking and arrange the carpenter to place them. But if you are willing to have more detailed kitchen interior, sure you will need to have a designer, just for the sake. Depends on how much money you have. Having a dedicated team of trained architects/Interior designers design your kitchen would probably end up looking better than you going to home depot and picking out finishes and materials yourself. Even if you are Design oriented, you might not have the time to develop and Idea/ concept/ theme, and then do the research into finding the plumbing fixtures,appliances and cabinetry to meet that theme and meet the budget. (Its not impossible but it is time consuming to research all the different brands) Doing everything yourself should suffice if you\u2019re an everyday middle class person who entertains their family on holidays and special occasions. If you are a little more affluent, and have to have a nicer kitchen than your neighbor, and want to impress people with a beautiful pinterest kitchen, you really cant beat a professional coming in and doing what they do best. If you are working with an existing structure where there is no possibility of making structural changes, then you are going to be money ahead doing it yourself. If you are not, then you are likely to be money ahead using the services of a \u201ckitchen design centre\u201d AFTER you have worked out exactly what you want to be doing in your kitchen.",

By assigning a meaning or thinking there is some purpose to something, we are building up some kind of expectations and opinions around it.

In this process we even define and brand certain things as good, bad etc. If you want to figure out what life is then stop assigning meaning to everything and instead experience it as is. This is just my perspective and no one really knows if there is a meaning to everything in a true sense or we just assign meaning to everything. Why is life so complicated than it seems?

        "a": "I presume you mean independent chis squareds. I generally work with the gamma distribution. This saves a lot of factors of 1/2 but otherwise the proof is much the same. You could just transform one variable to the sum and leave the other alone. Then you don\u2019t need to worry about the Jacobian, it\u2019s 1. But then you have to integrate the other variable out. A neat idea is to form two new variables, U = X+Y and V = X/Y. Then X = U - Y = YV, Y = U/(1+V) Then  [math]x^{a-1} e^{-x} y^{b-1} e^{-y} = (vy)^{a-1} y^{b-1} e^{-u} = v^{a-1} u^{a+b-2}/(1+v)^{a+b-2} e^{-u}[/math] . The Jacobian is quite simple. After multiplying by the Jacobian you will see that this factors as a function of the sum times a function of the ratio. That gives the distributions apart from the constant factors. But you know the constant factor for a gamma, so that\u2019s what you must put into the u part to make it integrate to 1. The rest is then the distribution of the ratio. This generalises the F distribution, but it\u2019s simpler because we didn\u2019t divide numerator and denominator by the degrees of freedom.",

        "a": "I first came to the Philippines for business in the mid 80\u2019s and decided to move here at retirement in 2009. I definitely noticed a distinct difference in the English proficiency of the average Filipinos. Things have worsened over the past decades. That being said, TV network are in the business of making money. As it was said in another answer, advertising revenues are directly related to market reach. Since there are far more Tagalog speaking Filipinos than there are People who understand English well enough to be interested in watching a whole non-dubbed English language movie. Capturing people\u2019s interest on TV networks is the main reason why. Is this a good thing or a bad thing, I will let you be the judge of that as I download everything I watch, filtered off stupid, mindless commercials that repeat themselves often enough that our children end up learning the ad jingles much faster then the multiplication table. This is not an isolated issue only affecting Filipinos. I grew up in the French speaking Canadian province of Quebec and we had a similar issue where English speaking movie and TV shows were being dubbed in French. Sad for us, the dubbing was often done in France with expressions and accents not necessarily pleasing to the locals. At least here in the Philippines, dubbing creates local employment and the language is your own. Welcome to the powerful world of advertising. What TV show do you wish was still on the air? What is the most original TV show ever made? What is the best way to use foreign television shows and movies to learn another language when you can't use subtitles? How do I air a show on CBS? How can I watch American shows dubbed in Italian? Most Filipinos under the age of 40 will have a reasonably good understanding of the English language, which has been learned through a combination of improved schooling, television showing English language programs and English language movies. For older Filipinos who grew up pre 1970\u2019s, there are many who still have little of no use or knowledge of the English language. Those from large cities or areas close to US Military bases being more competent in the English language through their interaction with the military. Outside of these areas especially in rural communities there was often little contact with English speakers and therefore less comprehension. In these rural areas school classes were general held in the native dialect and English classes if any were very limited. For many of these rural communities, Electricity when introduced was often limited and and televisions were not common, and programs were in Tagalog or the local dialect. In these communities everyday conversations were conducted almost entirely in the local dialogue. Travelling in rural Philippines it is still common to find many of all ages who have limited comprehension of English. In order to attempt to provide all inclusive programming broadcasters do use subtitles or on a number of programs have dubbed English language programs and movies into Tagalog allowing whole families to enjoy programs together. Well, it\u2019s not totally new. It\u2019s also not unique to the Philippines unless we\u2019re from the US, UK or Down Under. While we Filipinos are competent when it comes to English skills, only less than 50% belong to this group and the others don\u2019t understand English at all. So dubs became a band aid solution to the problem. However, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s full of cringe since Filipino/Tagalog lacks vocabulary for most of the things English has like \u201csnowman\u201d, technical terms, or the names of countries themselves. Don\u2019t worry, only the major TV networks do that. Once you get outside into cable networks, TV series remain in English and come on, it\u2019s 2017! We younger people are already streaming everything on the internet. We just leave the TV on for our parents because their dramas are still there with the same plot. But if I\u2019m watching a foreign TV show in British English\u2026 for the sake of God,  subtitles please . Because not all Filipinos are fluent in English and now its idiosyncrasies. Yes, most of us understand English but it is a simplified version. Not all Filipino families could send their children to proper schools and learn the language properly. It is important for these films to be accessible to the people so that they are aware of different cultures. Sure, it may help them understand English if they watch it in the original dubbing but it would wake multiple showings that the broadcasting network would sacrifice airtime for their local shows. They don't want that. This would be like hitting all the birds with one stone. Foreign shows aired in the Philippines are usually shown nationwide. Which means not only English speaking and literate people get to watch it. It might be the grandmother or grandfather wanted to watch the show with their grand children, and they don't know the English language, it would help them understand the show better in Tagalog. It also helps the hearing impaired, even if the show is spoken in English, they need ti read the translation to understand the show.",

        "a": "I agree with @ Tungku Lee  on this answer. Although you can find people from practically many countries of Asia and world, I am a bit hesitant to call it a melting pot. My feeling about Singapore has always been that the various races \u201ctolerate\u201d each other. I am not sure that everyone is really happy about this forced harmony. However, I do believe that being composed of a 40% foreigner population, Singapore is perhaps the closest to a melting pot that we can find in Asia. Other major Asian cities are composed of higher proportion of local population. What is life like for poor people in Singapore? Is hot pot popular in Asia? Is India considered to be a part of Asia? Can Singapore really become Asia's hub of innovation? Why is Singapore so anti China compared to most Asia countries? The term melting pot refers to our cultural and racial diversity. Singapore is known as an melting pot is due to our unique standing as a truly cosmopolitan country. In addition of the four local culture, namely the Chinese, Malays, Indians and Euroasian, we often see other ethnic and cultural group such as the Filipino, Caucasians walking among us. Yes, there are occasional casual racism, but generally, thanks to Singapore\u2019s strict enforcement on racial and religious harmony and strong government policy of promoting integration of new migrants, blatant and explicit racism is rare. Our effort in creating an inclusive identity we can pride ourselves on is became what is known as the melting pot, a pot with a bit of every culture well blended in, much like a nice plate of  rojak  (seriously delicious stuff, google it if you are not local). An observation that took me far too long to recognize concerning Singapore was the breadth of Asian cultures mingling there. For the longest time I always considered all those people in the malls of orchard road were local Singaporeans, then one day I came to a surprise realization that most of the shoppers were in fact almost all none Singaporean- kinda makes sense mid weekday shopping , most Singaporeans are at work ! Now I recognize Indonesians and Vietnamese in larger numbers than I had previously imagined, and no doubt even more Asian cultures that just drop by to enjoy the shopping (and the Health Care possibly ) and some overseas banking maybe. The concept of a melting pot is interesting but a difficult concept to define; a heterogeneous society becoming more homogeneous \u2014 several races and cultures \u201cmelting\u201d into one cohesive culture. The strongest elements that bind Singapore, in my opinion, is the English language. English is taught as the primary language in all schools and serves as the medium between the different cultures of Singapore. For example, in the US, cultures and races bond under the same premise of patriotism and that they are the greatest country in the world. They are united behind the concept of the American Dream. On the other hand, Singapore has no dreams, for it is difficult to extrapolate data from dreams and earn a stable income off dreams. Similar to a melting pot of various cheeses, the cheese with the highest ratio ultimately dominates the overall flavour. The Chinese majority certainly does have a certain hold on the culture and the systematic practices of the country. Ultimately, I disagree that Singapore is the melting pot of Asia as we lack the true diversity that Asia has. We do have room to grow; hopefully the Singaporean cultural identity grows beyond its current state and we feel a stronger nationalistic identity\u2026 And not only on National Day. Sure! Don't believe me? Little India for Indians. Geylang Serai for Malays. Beach Road for Thais. Fort Canning for Myanmarese. Chinatown for the Chinese. Orchard road for Filipinos. And the Ang Mohs are all over our heartland Hawker centres!",

        "a": "It really depends on context. This got to me because of a Tolkien-related tag. In Tolkien\u2019s case terms are used with no clear hierarchy. The sound of it matters the most. There are terms like \u201cThe Wizards\u201d or \u201cThe Necromancer\u201d or \u201cThe Powers\u201d that refer to specific being. But for most people magic is what they don\u2019t understand and they\u2019ll use whatever word is more convenient to them. Galadriel might be a witch or a sorceress or whatever people fancy. She has a power that they don\u2019t understand and are afraid of. In Harry Potter, on the other hand a witch is a female wizard and sorcerers are not a thing (although the word can be used as a synonym of \u2018wizard\u2019 for alliteration and such). In Terry Pratchett\u2019s Diskworld sorcerers are much more powerful (wizards and witches are different sorcerers are super-wizards more or less). In Dungeons and Dragons Sorcerers are one type of spellcaster and I\u2019m not sure about a witch (I think it\u2019s a female warlock and thus a different type of spellcaster). Other contexts - other answers. If Gandalf is more powerful than Galadriel, then why was Galadriel able to kill that orc in Dol Guldur so easily? Can I be a Muslim witch or boy witch? How do witches become witches and can you be born a witch? Is the Witch King as (or even more) powerful as/than Gandalf? Whose magic is more powerful, Harry Potter or the Witch King of Angmar? A sorceress SOUNDS more powerful than a witch, but in truth, the labels are pretty ambiguous, even among modern fantasy writers, and if you read enough of them, it\u2019s hard to say there is a definite difference between the two. There can definitely be a difference in a single story/legendarium, but not necessarily over a broad set of them. Historically, no because in reality there are not powerful sorceresses and witches. However, there is something interesting here. Sorcery and witchcraft were both seen as manipulation of supernatural forces, but witchcraft was associated with heresy and devil worship by the pre-modern era, as well as with lower classes and peasant behavior. Sorcery was associated with high magic, intellectualism, and manipulation of occult powers. In that sense, witchcraft was a crime and low class, but many in the nobility of Europe would have a sorcerer in their court to do astrology, entertain with tricks (one such involved drinking water and turning it to wine through powders or causing cooked meat to turn raw and bleed again through use of powders), or to write in cyphers etc. There were several medieval texts that described various things such as this. It was a mark of status to be able to afford a sorcerer. Thus the sorcerer could be argued to be *more* powerful in those societies because they held higher social status and were not associated with criminal heretic behavior by the secular authorities. Those words are practically synonyms. But as this question is in the Lord of The Rings category, I will answer it from that stand point. In LOTR, the 5 wizards, or Istari, are Maiar, basically angels, sent to earth by the Valar (gods). None of these wizards are female, so no witches or sorceresses exist in Middle-Earth. Depends on the person whether one is more powerful than the other. Sorceresses and witch are just different names for a practitioner of magik.",

Businesses need management which should be forever hungry, and never complacent or satisfied. Inequality results in recruitment from a narrow pool of candidates. They hire individuals from privileged backgrouns, who think and act like the generation before. Instead of finding the very best person to do the job, they end up with faces who best fit the frame on the golf-club wall. That sort of conservatism results in stagnant complacent decision making and a yes-man culture. Modern business needs to be punk rock, not easy listening. Inquality deprives business of the talent it needs. Is income inequality really increasing? Why is inequality a problem? Why is inequality more of a problem now more than ever? What is the real problem, poverty or inequality? Why is income inequality such a huge problem in the U.S.? And what can be done to fix this problem?

I say this because, if you just type and follow simple heading styles with a good enough language, your resume content might be good, but it will be bland. It will not be appealing to a person hiring because they do not have much time to FIND the REQUIRED EXPERIENCE in your simple formatted resume. So, it is advisable to follow a pre-formatted version and edit relevant details to just complete and present your skills in a best way possible. You may simply do a google search for  free resume templates  and find basic formats that are more than enough for any general application. But if you are a specialist at a particular field and need to highlight the particular fields to get hired, you search for precisely resume format for the position you are looking to apply for.

Type it, correct it, give it all the details that should sketch a complete path of your career, your requirement of the job, what they get when they hire you, etc. So eventually, yes you should go for a word format in resume, and fill in all details. You can always modify it to look different from the standard format, but as far as my experience goes it will matter least for the decision of you getting hired.

How does a six stroke engine with water injection work? How many valves are present in a 4 stroke engine? Though a 2-stroke engine has a better power output than a 4-stroke engine even then we use 4-stroke engine in cars. Can we tweak a 2-stroke en... How does a single cylinder 4 stroke engine work? Which types of diesel (2 stroke or 4 stroke) engine is more efficient? From RallyCars: \u201cWater injection systems are predominantly useful in forced induction (turbocharged or supercharged), internal combustion engines. Only in extreme cases such as very high compression ratios, very low octane fuel or too much ignition advance can it benefit a normally aspirated engine. The system has been around for a long time since it was already used in some World War II aircraft engines. A water injection system works similarly to a fuel injection system with the difference that it injects water, or a mixture of water and alcohol,\u00a0 instead of fuel. Water injection is not to be confused with water spraying on the inlet air charge cooler\u2019s surface, water spraying is much less efficient and far less sophisticated.\u201d No it won\u2019t. The extraction of energy to heat and boil the water cools the combustion gas reducing cylinder pressure and thus force of the gas on the piston and turning torque on the crank and the power output. The engine will run smoothly and cool but a dyno test will show it\u2019s lost power. Yes, it will increase efficiency since the water will vaporize into steam and push the piston thus creating an additional stroke using wasted heat. Theoretically, it will give 50% more fuel efficiency. But practically, the engine will develop problems much faster than regular 4 stroke because water is bad for an engine especially when it is running. Also, power imbalance due to extra strokes will cause unpleasant vibrations. Possibly but the real question is will it produce more power than required to run the very high pressure water pump if not you will have a net power loss.",

I have other jobs that I like, but putting those together still leaves me with less money. I had money saved up! Oth wise I wouldn't have pulled this off. i am assuming that you are in one right now. The safest thing you can is start applying to better jobs right now. Then if you get one you think you will likely like more, you can mve safely. When I got out of each I didn't have anywhete to go. The money loss was huge for some time. I mean super huge. with the question of just resigning, which I suggest you do in a professional way without showing anger. Here is critical info though: I do not have children or a mortgage or credit card debt or any other source of debt. I am debt free. If I had debt things I would killed by now. My financial responsibilities are very low, on purpose. And this gives me more freedom but with less money. Safest thing is to look for a better jobs right now. And it is likely that asking your current job for a reference could lead to trouble, even the loss of your job. Another thing is that I now work through a handful of part time jobs. I am a musician and this is common for us. So you might say, dear Lord. No health insurance! I am now on Obamacare and I even get a small bit of federal funding. Leavng a job with no plans will cost you many many thousands of dollars most likely. And if you have serious financial obligations I would say don't do that! Assuming this job is so upsetting that it starts to destroy your sanity. If it is making sick, get out! But if you have debts or are paying off a mortgage, another form of debt, or are supporting children thst is a different story. This way or not the safe mood is to replace the job before you leave. And make sure that the next job isn't likely to be bad. Dont go bankrupt!",

It reduces the \u201ckeep-on-talking\u201d nature of mind about failures and problems, and helps you to \u201cget-rid\u201d of those things without talking to anyone about it. Doing \u201cmetta\u201d meditation ( love-kindness  to whole universe including your enemies, your parents, creatures, anyone in the universe) Visiting a set of  good friends  every now and then, and having a good conversation. A friend who loves you and behaves well is so valuable in life. Stop eating junk food, and start eating fruits, grain like mung, cow-pea, a lot of vegetables boiled (perhaps without salt) etc. Lifestyle: What is the one thing that I can start doing today that will promise a greater life for me in the future? What made you happy today? Does being rich make you happier? Am I the only one who is thinking that most of the writers these days are exaggerating every small thing? How can I be happy every day? Take time for you and start to write down what your grateful for daily. The biggest thing we forget about when it comes to health and happiness is taking the time for ourselves and realizing all the greatness already in life. Yes eating healthy and exercise are very important to our health, they can sometime be over whelming though. The smallest things you can do is make time for you and Find Gratitude. I\u2019ve got to resources for you! A list of of  50+ Self Care Activities  and my  7 Day Gratitude Challenge ! Have a morning ritual that reinforces a positive mindset. Something you do every morning for about 10 to 15 minutes and it should be the first thing you do when you wake up. It could be listening to motivational music or speeches. It could be a short body workout. Anything that makes you feel good about yourself and motivates you to achieve whatever goals you have. Be consistent and never miss a day, no matter how tired you are. You will be surprised at how your attitude toward other things in your life change. Healthier and happier means you tend to have an active lifestyle. In reality. You need energy to sustain this. Start with food. Eat better. Exercise. Get more fit. Jog the mind. Read. The small things you can do everyday to develop the emotional awareness is: immediately upon waking up stretch, breathe, and connect with your heart and mind spread gratitude from within to all the small and big things you have going in your life right now set your emotions high, sense the energy moving upwards within an hour of waking up read a chapter in a fiction/non-fiction book write a paragraph step outside into the sun think and feel the entire day being great In about a week or so, you\u2019ll be able to \u201clook back\u201d see and feel the progress you\u2019ve made.

If light reflects off mirrors then why do we see the mirror? Can I get reflection light from block hole? What is lateral inversion in a plane mirror? Well what I do know is, light disperses. Its nature is not like a single beam( as portrayed in the picture). Light consists of multiple beams and each of these beams diverge from each other, so technically before you even notice anything all this light will disperse from your \u201ctrap\u201d. And I am not too sure about this but I do believe light will eventually lose its energy, so even if you manage to figure out a way to stop beams from diverging, you would still have to find a power source which can power a light bulb that can emit light at such a great intensity, to make sure the trapped light doesn't die instantaneously .",

        "a": "Well, it may controverting all existing economic theories but I simply cannot see any quality in our present economic growth --- they all use resources unlimitedly and produce products and services that are either unnecessary or harmful to human and environment. They are all blindly pursuing profit. They are all unsustainable process. The list can go on and on\u2026 The so called productive activities such as material production activities are actually create nothing --- it just converting real value into use value in an efficiency loss and value loss: most of the products and services produced are either unnecessary or harmful to human and environment that do triple harm --- 1) waste real value (resources), 2) harm human health and environment, 3) waste human labour that should be concentrated on produce effective information but be used on wasting real value. The so called non- productive economic activities: trade, finance, stock market, are distributions of economic factors to facilitate the activities of economic process to efficiently exploit the differences in the economic factors potentials to make profit. This helps to even down the world\u2019s economic factors potentials and depleting the remaining real value reserve in the world. See from above, we know that all present economic activities are harmful things to do to human society ad human future. Among them, the so called productive activities such as material production activities are the worst in harming human future; while the so called non- productive economic activities that are the distributions are the second worst that assist the production activities. The only standard I can use to measure the quality of economic growth is the rational efficiency principle: use the minimal real value to produce the maximum effective information. The material products and services are the intermediate input for the production of the final product --- effective information, so have to be minimised to the optimal minimal. The only sustainable part of the real value supply is the Sun\u2019s energy supply to the Earth, that sustainability depend on one condition --- the ecosystem be kept in good working conditions to convert that real value into the form that we can use it to survive. So, my civilised and uncivilised friends, if your economy is not even ecologically sustainable, where is the quality in it? Is your standard for measuring the quality of economy objective or subjective? I think the first thing you have to find the correct purpose for your life, then make the purpose of your economy serve the purpose of your life, then you will find the correct standard for measuring the quality of economy. Don\u2019t you agree? If not, why? Is GDP a good measure of economic growth? Why or why not? Is GDP or GNP the best measure of economic growth? Is there a better way to measure a countries's economic growth? What are the different ways to measure aggreggate economic activity? Is there any type of economic growth metric that takes into account quality of life too? GDP per capita is so far the best way to measure economic growth. By the way, what do you mean by artificial growth? In a market based economy, economic growth mainly comes from technological progress, mainly innovated by firms. Government plays a secondary role here. It is not the business of the government to invest in anything. If the object of investment is new, and risky, let somone else pay for it, and carry the risk: it is not the taxpayers\u2019 responsibility to indulge the fantasies/hopes/\u201dvisions\u201d of some damned politico. If the investment is to be in some well established field, then leave it to the existing industrial base to trim the excess, and grow where there is a deficiency: how does this become a governmental responsibility ? If \u201cyou\u201d - or anyone else, for example, wants to see more \u201cgreen\u201d energy, then let them go out and build a field of windmills; or watermills; or nuclear power stations; or solar arrays. It is not the government\u2019s job to do these things, nor to provide subsidies, nor tax breaks, nor preferential zoning decisions. We cannot afford \u201cgreen energy at any price,\u201d it has to be affordable green energy. So keep state wonks and their crummy mendacious economic policies out of the equations - or we will get what we deserve, phony growth. Innovation. A prized indicator of the quality of an economy. Greater innovation tends to come from economies that have better competition. Good competition needs low barriers to foreigners, limited regulation, low corruption aided by swift justice and evidently, private capital. If all you can churn out are 350 billionaires who do stuff like make cement, build mass housing projects and manufacture steel. It probably means the economy isn\u2019t of all that good a quality. That\u2019s because in an ideal world, stuff like this shouldn\u2019t create billionaires as there\u2019re people who know to do this very, very well and there\u2019s little scope for  incrementa l innovation, thus a fine recipe for having oligarchies. Ina closed economy though, having a cement-selling \u201crags-to-riches\u201d billionaire would be very very understandable. Now it\u2019s another thing if you\u2019re a billionaire because you knew how to make cars fly and actually make it practically function in the world at a decent cost. In a closed economy though, you may have a better incentive to manufacture cement as there\u2019s no competition, isn't it?",

        "a": "We\u2019re still not sure about the cause of the collapse of the Shang dynasty. Early historians tend to attribute the downfall of a dynasty to the self-indulgence of a tyrant, but modern historians have long pointed out things are not that simple. I can think out only one emperor, whose self-indulgence directly led to the end of a great dynasty. That\u2019s Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty. Even in his case, he actually indulged himself in great enterprises rather than personal enjoyments. In an age when social engagement was not very advanced, a government could easily attract grudges when it failed to deal with natural disasters. And natural disasters frequently happened. Some historians believe the Ming dynasty died of natural disaster. I remember a sentence in the letter written by Li Zicheng, the leader of the rebellious peasant army, to Emperor Chongzhen, the last emperor of th Ming dynasty, \u2018you\u2019re not a bad emperor (\u541b\u975e\u751a\u6697).\u2019 As the Ming dynasty is near to our time, we can have a close observation of its last emperor, who wasn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t be vilified as a traditional squandering tyrant. He came to the throne at 16 and reigned for 16 years. Every day of the 16 years he spent in extreme stress and anxiety, striving to hold up the falling-apart empire. He knew there was a Louis XVI\u2019s end waiting for him if he failed, and the inevitable fate was not his own creation, but inherited. That\u2019s why many people held deep compassion for Emperor Chongzhen and his Ming dynasty. The Kun opera  Assassination of the Tiger  tells the story of a court maid who had witnessed and been moved by the emperor\u2019s desperate efforts to save his empire assassinating a general of the peasant army. I\u2019m not saying the Shang dynasty collapsed because of the same reason. I just provide a near instance for you to analyze it from another perspective. The last king of the Shang dynasty would have been a super fool to squander his heritage as depicted in history books. According to my limited readings, even the historians who vilified him admitted that he was actually very handsome and bright. Who was the Marquis of Chong in the last years of the Shang dynasty? What was the true name of King Zhou of the Shang dynasty? What is the relation between the cities of Yin and Zhaoge, both said to have been the last capital of the Shang dynasty? Why did the Shang Dynasty end? Did people of the Shang dynasty use the wheel? \u201cThe history is like a defenseless doll whoever has the power could dress it by its will.\u201d  \u5386\u53f2\u5c31\u50cf\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u4eba\u6253\u626e\u7684\u5c0f\u59d1\u5a18 The last King of Shang, \u5e1d\u8f9b, was not really an incapable and ruthless ruler like what he had been described in the history written by the winner, Zhou dynasty. According to \u7af9\u4e66\u7eaa\u5e74Bamboo annals, the last king of Shang was a very talent ruler and well-respected and loved by its own people. Under his rule, the Shang dynasty had decisively defeated their biggest external enemy \u4e1c\u5937, who had a continuous war with Shang for tens of years. And also the last king had defeated and captured its biggest internal enemy, \u5468\u6587\u738b, the ruler of Zhou tribe and the father of the later 1st king of Zhou dynasty. He showed both his mercy and political sophistication by putting \u5468\u6587\u738b in the prison for several years to contain its ambition but finally let him go to avoid an internal war. All his life, \u5468\u6587\u738b had not dared to raise a civil war again. But \u5e1d\u8f9b had underestimated the threat of \u5468\u6587\u738b\u2019s young son, \u5468\u6b66\u738b. He thought Zhou would not dare to attack him again after the last defeat, so he put all his forces into the war with \u4e1c\u5937, although they won at the end but with great costs and left its 2nd capital \u671d\u6b4c ill-defended. And \u5468\u6b66\u738b had caught the best moment to attack \u5e1d\u8f9b when his main forces were still in the newly conquered \u4e1c\u5937 and the latter was out of its well-defended main capital but in the vulnerable 2nd capital. \u5e1d\u8f9bonly had time to assemble an army from the slaves who worked near the 2nd capital, which was apparently not a match to the well-prepared army of Zhou. After the battle, \u5e1d\u8f9b fled to the palace and burned himself. So basically speaking, in the eyes of Shang people , they felt their beloved great King had been betrayed and backstabbed by Zhou, so it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise that when their king\u2019s son rose to overthrow the usurper \u5468\u6587\u738b, many of the Shang people would follow him. Shang was fundamentally different from Zhou. The former was a militant tribe that frequent attacked adjacent enemy tribes for various reasons, one of which was bring back enough captives for human sacrifice. Hundreds of humans could be killed as sacrifice offered to their ancestral kings for one ritual. Historians speculated that Shang\u2019s victorious aggressions are due to its supremacy in occupying abundant copper resources and manufacturing bronze weapons. As for Zhou, it was well-known for raising crops and seemed to have little interest in human sacrificing. Although Zhou was a vassal tribe to Shang, from a Zhou\u2019s point of view, Shang was nothing but a ruthless ruler. So after Zhou defeated Shang and took over the \u2018mandate of heaven\u2019, it was urgent to downplay Shang\u2019s influence because there still was a large Shang army fighting on the eastern front against enemy tribes there. Although Shang was defeated, its strength remained (a large army and plenty of Shang people). Zhou negotiated with Shang and both agreed that Zhou could replace Shang as the \u2018heavenly king\u2019 while Shang, along with its aristocracy and people, would be pardoned and keep necessary properties to live on. Generally speaking, Zhou won as a weaker state while Shang was defeated as a stronger one. That\u2019s why Wu Geng obtained so much support because at the time Shang still had everything needed to retaliate and almost succeeded. Thanks for the A2A. For that period of history, we only have records from Zhou\u2019s perspective left. There was no Shang\u2019s narrative as we know. And Zhou\u2019s record has clearly been modified and distorted in favor of Zhou\u2019s invasion. It is possible that Shang was not that bad and Zhou was not that good. The things you mentioned in question could be an evidence.",

If it stays plugged in, then the cycles don't increase. But you do have to deplete it on a fortnightly basis to keep the battery properly calibrated. Another point to keep in mind is the drop in charge holding capacity of the cells. It varies based upon the technology(composition of the cells & lot more). You could try searching for iPad related stats where it has been used as a POS/Kiosk/schools to get an idea of device replacement cycles. How do I switch off the payment mode in iPad Air 2? Can my iPad Air 2 cause cancer? I use it 5-8 hours a day on the past 6 months. What are the risk for my health? I have an iPad Air 2, and I have a problem. When I delete an application I find it after some hours redownloaded. What should I do? Can a 13 inch MacBook Air last 4 years of college? Should I buy an iPad Air 2 for Christmas this year? In almost ideal conditions of weather and usual usage, an iPad should last quite long in year as long as 6\u20138 years. There is something about Apple products as much as i have seen with people around me that even if we use its products cautiously, they tend to stop working after a certain time period. It can start showing lines on screen, other screen issues, hardware button wearing out or even as blunt as the device simply becoming dead one fine day. Although such demerits exist, the device would work really efficiently till it is in working condition. As you need to use it on a professional level, you need to know that every battery has a prescribed number of charges and discharges as mentioned by the manufacturer. So that could help you figure out your estimate. Besides, every battery if used in the manner that it is completely charged and such, only after it is completely discharged, meaning to say that if the battery is uniformly charged and discharged, then it lasts as long as it can under ideal conditions. (From my personal experience - i have a MacBook Pro 17-inch which has absolutely no battery issues though it is 7 and a half years old as of today.) Apart from battery, the other thing you should be careful about is temperature of the environment. High temperatures just may catalyse marginal evaporation of circuit contacts in the chip board, which may lead to lessening of the product life. Moisture level in the environment doesn't much affect an iPad as it has a good packing physically.",

        "a": "Generally No. When you default on a 401(k) loan, the outstanding loan balance is treated as a taxable distribution (since you did not pay it back). You are subject to Federal and State taxes, plus Federal and State early withdrawal penalties (if applicable to you). While, there are technically two ways to handle the loan default, both result in taxes owed. It all comes down to whether or not you were eligible for a distribution from the 401(k) plan at the time of default. If so, then the loan would have been considered a \u201cLoan Offset\u201d. Meaning, you would have been taxed as if you took it as a distribution and the loan would disappear from your 401(k) statement. If you were not eligible for a distribution at the time you defaulted on the loan, it would have been treated as a \u201cDeemed Distribution\u201d. This means, you still are subject to taxes and penalties, but the defaulted loan stays on your 401(k) statement until such time you either repay the loan or are eligible for a distribution from your account. If you repay a defaulted loan that was treated as a \u201cDeemed Distribution\u201d, the payments are treated as after-tax contributions (since you already paid taxes on that money when the loan defaulted). When you terminate employment, the loan payments would be distributable tax-free. The question then becomes, \u201cWhy repay the loan after default if it does not have any tax advantages?\u201d The reason you would repay the defaulted loan is because most plans will not allow you to take a new loan if you have a defaulted loan on the books. How do you tell if your loan was treated as a Loan Offset or a Deemed Distribution? - look at your Form 1099-R you should have received in January. If BOX 7 is a code L, that means it was treated as a Deemed Distribution and should still appear on your 401(k) statements. If any other code, it was treated as a Loan Offset. My Employer screwed up my 401K loan repayment and I now owe taxes and a 10% early withdrawal fine. What can I do about this now? Bank fixed wrong EMI amount on loan repayment, what to do now? Can I show an SBI top up loan as a tax exemption? How can I clear my loan dues of ABN Amro? Do I have to repay the loan? Short answer: Repaying the loan will not help with IRS taxes that are now due. More detail: According to  Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Loans \u201c What can be done to remedy a default after there has been a deemed distribution? If a participant failed to make payments on a plan loan, the missed payments can still be made even after a deemed distribution has occurred. In that case, the participant\u2019s or beneficiary\u2019s tax basis under the plan is increased by the amount of the late repayments.\u201d As I read this, I would say if you have defaulted on a 401(k) loan, the defaulted balance will be a deemed distribution and taxable in the year it is declared. (Your question implies that this has already happened.) At this point, repayments will add to the after-tax basis in your 401(k) that the plan should track. When you later receive distributions from this 401(k), each distribution will be partially nontaxable (the non-taxable percentage = the after-tax basis/your overall 401(k) balance). You won't be taxed a second time on this repaid money, but this will not help with your current tax problem.",

        "a": "That\u2019s a tough question with many options. You need to think through the long term market. If there is hope of a comeback, like the housing market, you need to decide if you can scale and survive. If there  is a long term market  you can\u2026 IF you  cannot  scale and survive decide to wind down business. Closing a business hurts but better to do it voluntarily than be forced to do it later. Some business cannot scale down then come back it takes to much. You might have to sustain a certain volume from a supplier to be at the right price point. IF you  can  scale and survive scale down and survive until an upturn. It may be hard for a few months or years but surviving can be good. It\u2019s a gamble to look at the future market and know how much debt and cuts you can make to rebound and survive. If there is  NOT a long term market  you can\u2026 Introduce other products  outside the market. This can be dangerous because you might not have the same passion for the new market. You might not understand the new market as well and it can be expensive to enter a new market. Close the business,  again this isn\u2019t an ideal choice but can be a good choice.

Well, you have just run into the product lifecycle curve. It affects virtually every product at one point or another. The issue is, do you have a replacement product in your development lifecycle? What? You didn\u2019t do that? Nobody planned ahead because life was good, sales were rising and your product was a cash cow? Then shame on the management! They better get their act together soon. Start by basic product life cycle management ( see  http://CEAnow.org  for a course on this). At this point, you have to pinpoint the product on the lifecycle. Number 1 key to finding a solution is figuring out what\u2019s going on. Why is the market tanking? Is this unique to your company, or are competitors experiencing the same thing? Have new, better or cheaper substitutes entered the market? Why is demand drying up? Have you lost your core customers? Is this a product problem, a marketing problem, a sales problem or a competition problem? Next, you have to figure out a solution. It may be that your marketing is inadequate, you have a changing demographic, your competition is beating you , or your sales efforts are inadequate, ineffective or counter productive. It may be a product problem. Have you kept up with the trends? Have you improved the product? Is there a problem with style, packaging, quality, or quantity? (having enough to sell) What is the product USP? Is it a valid USP (unique selling proposition) and how is it being communicated to prospects effectively? Do you have a clue what the buying decision process looks like for your prospects, customers, and the customers of your competitors? It may be a distribution problem. Are your retailers experiencing stock outs? Are orders not being shipped properly, being damaged, mis-directed or lost? Are you beset by returns? It may be a pricing problem. How are you determining price? Is it competitive? How are you differentiating? There is no simple rule for addressing this problem. Most companies commit product suicide by failing to address one or more of the issues we\u2019ve raised here. Truly great companies work on this stuff all the time\u2026 and they are ahead of the curve. They anticipate market changes and are prepared to address these issues. My suggestion is simply that you stop, step back and do some careful analysis of the situation. You will find that there are usually more than one problem here\u2026 and by addressing them you will be able to rescue your company.",

There were no explicit laws prohibiting inter racial marriages per se, but people choosing to do so would only harm themselves. Besides, the Catholic Church was not exactly enthusiastic about these marriages. In fact, there was so much resistance to these relationships that king Jos\u00e9 I enacted a law, in 1755, specifically legalizing Amerindian-Portuguese marriages. In other words, miscegenation laws were indirect. For example, starting on 1612, it was mandatory to prove you were a \u201cpure blood\u201d citizen in order to take on public office, sometimes up to the fourth generation. This law was initially thought as an anti-Jewish law, but could be applied to all \u201cinfected nations\u201d. In Brazil, one of the most noticeable cases was documented by Luiz Mott when he studied the archives of several Bahian convents and discovered that \u201cmixed\u201d girls were not accepted as novices. Also, to cite another case, in 1591, Heitor Furtado de Mendon\u00e7a , a Portuguese priest coming to Brazil, was investigated 16 times in order to prove that he didn\u2019t have \u201cinfected blood stains of either Jewish, Moorish, Black or Indian peoples\u201d as a requisite to take part on the Inquisition. These indirect laws only began to be revoked during the Pombaline Period, in the 1750s and 1760s.

Dad figured something shady was going on and sure enough, about an hour later. The sheriff drove by going uptown, so Dad got into his car and went up.

Everyone knew everyone else that lived there, so Dad told them what he had seen and what way he went when Dad freed him from the chain.

Dad told them that he was probably in a barn about a half mile west of town. It was all that was left of an old farmstead and the guy on the bike was known to sleep one off there occasionally. Sure enough the sheriff drove out there and the bike was parked in front of the barn and the old boy, still in a dress was sleeping it off. Dad said the jailers, in addition to taking the old boy's mug shot. Also took a few pictures of him in his dress and had them hanging in the county jail until the late 1960\u2019s. Seems a new sheriff didn't think they belonged on the jailhouse office walls. I think Dad said the old boy got 6 months in a small farming type prison. People laughed about that deal for 25 years or more. Texting and walking into a police cruiser. Selling hot peanuts without a permit. Stealing a slice of pizza . Yelling \u201cfire\u201d in a crowded theater. Feeding pigeons against city ordinance. Wearing white after labor day. Shoplifting, just dumb shit",

Any institute, whether it may be code ninja it will not reach you the advance concepts of a language. At some point of your learning phase(which is a never ending phase) , you will need to learn the concepts by yourself. So why not do it from the very start. Moreover, if you join a college , first of all you will not be wasting an year and also generally the first year of college is very easy so you can devote atleast 50% of your daily time into programming or coding. These colleges ,if you perform well , will definitely provide you with some internships in your 2nd or 3rd year and if not there are many companies which provide you so , one of them being internshala which is an app which will provide you with some cool internships near you . It's completely up to you whether you want to drop or not. Dropping an year will have its own enormous benefits , provided if you are very clear with your goal and do not waste your precious time. Hope this helps. Cheers.! What is a good way to learn and code VBA? What is your review of Coding Ninjas? Should I drop out of school to learn to code? I am doing my final year of a B.Tech in CSE and am not good in coding. What are the computer science fields that will suit my career? How do I learn coding within a year? No you don't have to drop a year for learning coding as in college they starts its from basic. But there you have to furnish your skills everyday so that you can compete with other students who knows coding from last 4\u20135 years. As you told that they are offering internships , you that in your 2\u20133 months weekends which you will get in summers. No need to waste your 1 year just to learn coding..Do it with your btech it is not good to drop a year for internship. B.Tech is very important degree to start your career. when pursuing B.Tech , you always have chances for internships ( either from college or out-campus companies). If you are interested in coding, you will always find good amount of time because your interest will always make you manage your time. so my suggestion to you is to pursue your B.Tech and do stuffs mean-while.",

However, I don\u2019t smile because I want others to see that I\u2019m smiling, I smile because  I\u2019m happy . Maybe, just maybe, someone who sees my smile may feel slightly happier, and thus I have shared my happiness. Now, when someone is very happy, perhaps from a recent achievement, they are so happy that they want to tell the whole world that they are happy. They may post their achievement on social media, tell family and friends, or even (occasionally) just go out into the street and scream \u201c I\u2019M HAPPY! \u201d.

But you know if heart likes anything, it never lose hope and in my case it was same. One day he told me that he has a girlfriend thats why he was asking me to just be a friend. That day I simply asked one question that why didn't he told me earlier. Afterward, I was just been a good friend who always prayed best for them. One day, his girlfriend got to know about me. She abused me because she thinks that I was fooling his boyfriend. She thinks that it was all my fault that his boyfriend was interested in me. From that day, I never tried to explain myself to any of them.  I just left. Usually that boy crosses my way somehow.. But I   SMILE.. As much as I can naturally Because it is a best revenge, when he see me more happy and content without him. Thank you How do I let someone go that I care very deeply for? What is it like to lose a child? How do I stop missing someone I was very close to? How do you let a very sweet but not too bright man down easy? Have you ever been addicted to someone? Yes I have. I did my best and gave it everything I had. And it wasn\u2019t good enough. After that? Living and getting through each day helped. Crying, grieving, eating my favorite foods, travelling helped. Reliving the memories hurt - but that helped too. Friends, family, my job and my workouts - all of which I gradually came to see as blessings, ALL helped. And this quote helped me make sense of all of it - \u201cWhen she came to her senses again she cut off all contact with him. It had not been easy, but she had steeled herself. The last time she saw him she was standing on a platform in the tunnelbana at Gamla Stan and he was sitting in the train on his way downtown. She had stared at him for a whole minute and decided that she did not have a grain of feeling left, because it would have been the same as bleeding to death. &%$# you.\u201d \u2015 Steig Larrson, The Girl Who Played With Fire (Apt title too :) ) P.S: I don\u2019t agree with all of the quote.

It includes your lover, your family, friends and even you yourself.  And I don\u2019t feel it is right to blame someone for it because nobody is perfect.

        "a": "The balance of power between the Democratic and Republican parties has already shifted enormously in the past 30 odd years toward far greater power for the Republicans to the point that Democrats are in serious danger of becoming irrelevant. To date this has been because the DNC (democratic national committee), in no small part led by the Clintons has emphasized effort be placed on winning federal elections at the expence of local politics, and has, for practical purposes, if not intentionally, largely conceded rural political issues to the Republican party. The DNC has emphasized issues that get the largest national vote totals, while ignoring the US constitutional system that gives greater power to smaller states (smaller in population, and so rural) in control of the federal government and the constitution. In contrast the Republican party during the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s started to emphasize building their party at the grass roots level and emphasizing local service and local elections primarally, and only then federal elections, this has gradually built republican power over the past 30 years at the state and local such that now the Republicans are the majority party in most US States. They even have strongholds in rural areas of states that are normally considered democratic strongholds like California. In a Further Blow to Democrats, Republicans Increase Their Hold on State Governments Republicans now dominate state government, with 32 legislatures and 33 governors They do not control leftist areas with high levels of city people and immigrants such as urban California or Chicago or the large northeastern east coast cities. Note that Democrats outright control 6 states, have limited control in 2 for a total of 8. Republicans have outright control of 25 states, limited control of 2 for a total of 27. We have 15 states with divided control, but most of these are more rural states, where Republicans hold an implicit policy advantage. Urban and rural America are becoming increasingly polarized Urban counties (with more than 500,000 population) voted substantially more democratic going from 2004 to 2016 with 112 counties of 137 shifting more toward Democrats. While when looking at rural counties with under 25000 people the shift is in the exact opposite direction, with Rural counties 1362 of 1508 shifting toward Republicans. This article did not break it down further than that, obviously many US Counties have more than 25000 people and less than 1/2 million. This long term fight by the Republicans to control state and local government is paying off with dividends, while the the short term strategy of trying for control of the federal government has not. Trump is an anomaly as a Republican, he is from NYC, yet his demographic support is undeniably the Republican base. It was a surprise to most that Trump won the general Trump has an extraordinary ability to reduce his speech to the lowest common denominator to make it easy for the least educated members of the Republican base to clearly understand him. That he does this tends to make them fiercely loyal to him. Trump has also not pandered to the establishment US media who are mostly aligned with the Democratic party. In no small part because of this, and as a result of it, he has been under continuous attack by them, often with them insinuating corruption or improper behavior, usually with no evidence at all. As an example the press is reporting that President Trump provided classified information to the Russian Ambassador, and so what? The president has the legal authority to declassify information, or to classify information, and to share it with whom he chooses. This is a non-story that left-wing media think that by being loud enough about, they can make something of this non-issue. Why President Trump Can Share Classified Information If He Wants Do presidents have 'the ability to declassify anything'? I anticipate much additional yelling and commotion by leftist media, and as a result left-wing media losing significant traction with, and trust of the American people. The election of Trump was probably a bit ahead of schedule by Republican plans and was not the party\u2019s preference for president. The people running the Republican party wanted Jeb Bush or someone like him. They were possibly surprised that Ms Clinton was running for president given her negatives. They did not want Senator Cruz, and certainly did not want Donald Trump running for president, but that is who the rank & file settled on. Finally to answer your question. I estimate the probability of Mr. Trump being impeached at under 30% over the whole of his presidency. I estimate the probability of him being convicted by the senate, if impeached, at maybe 1 in 6. That being a cumulative chance of 5% of impeachment and conviction. The 25th amendment is not going to be used to remove Trump unless he is actually ill. I think the probability of this is under 1%. I hold the probability of Trump resigning as also under 1%. Finally the balance of power between Republicans and Democrats will remain much the same as if Trump was still president. Some shift in the house and/or senate to Democrats is likely, but not a major one. The Republicans have built a strong organization, and the Democrats have squandered resources for 30 odd years. That is not going to change overnight. What might happen now that President-elect Donald Trump has won the election? What will be the impact? Are Democrats \"happy\" about the destruction of the GOP by Donald Trump? Will Donald Trump defeat his opponent in the general election? Who is Donald Trump most likely to choose as Vice President? Could Donald Trump be a Democratic plant? Is he trying to help Hillary Clinton? If Trump is impeached or resigns, how might the balance of power between the GOP and Democrats evolve before the next election, and why? I don't think it will change much. The problem is that Mike Pence looks almost rational compared to Trump. But he's not, his priorities are all wrong as evidenced by his speech while accepting the VP nomination: \u201cI'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order,\" he said Those priorities should be reversed so that he takes a view of all Americans, insteading of pushing policies that focus on religion, which only benefits the evangelical portion of his base. Because he a polished political operator, he won't look crazy, but those policies will not help America. Religion should stay at home and not be a part of politics.",

        "a": "So imagine two drivers in the race, A and B. A is leading the race and thus has track position. To try and \u201cundercut\u201d A, B may come in for an earlier pit stop which means he will put on fresher tyres earlier. This means that while A stays out on older tyres, B has pitted and is on newer tyres so will naturally be faster. B will be able to close the gap, such that when A does finally come in for a pitstop, he will now be behind B. But A's tyres will be fresher come the end of the race. The undercut essentially allows you to try and gain time initially to obtain track position by putting on fresher and faster tyres earlier. This is a great strategy on circuits where it is difficult to overtake but the downside is that by putting on fresher tyres before your opponent, once the other person pits, he will now have fresher tyres than you and will start catching up to you. Then, come the end of the race when your tyres are far more worn, they will have a greater chance of overtaking you. The undercut is key for track position and at say Monaco or Spain, this is very effective as overtakes are far more difficult. So to prevent this from happening teams would usually keep tabs on their competitors (listening to the broadcasted radio messages) and will try and mirror them to prevent the undercut. Or sometimes a change in strategy is used by going for a longer stint on the first set of tyres meaning that your tyres will be a lot more fresher and quicker come the end of the race compared to your competitor. However, in a track that encourages overtaking, the undercut isn't as effective as track position counts for less. I think Spa (Belgium) is a good example as there are many points on the circuit where an overtake can be effected, so in the same scenario of A having fresher tyres at the end, he will have a much better chance of overtaking B at the end of the race. Also, the undercut is hugely reliant on a quick pit stop and feeding back into \u201cclean air\u201d (not behind any other cars). This is because if the driver attempting the undercut gets stuck behind a slower car, he will not be able to make the same gain in time and his tyres will also degrade quicker - making the whole strategy redundant as he will in fact lose time to the person he tried to undercut. How many pit stops are there in a Formula One race? Does height plays a role in becoming a Formula 1 driver? Formula 1: Why do F1 drivers suddenly get so slow the lap before they pit? How many formula 1 drivers know how an engine works? What road cars do Formula One drivers own? The undercut is a pit strategy which has come into the fore in recent seasons, especially since 2010, when refuelling was banned again for cost and safety reasons. Since the cars carry all the fuel onboard at the start of the race, they get faster and faster as the race goes on. The only thing negating this weight advantage is tyre degradation, which makes them slower even as the fuel burning\u200b off should do the opposite. This has come even more into play in recent seasons as the Pirelli tyres have a tendency to lose performance as they degrade, contrary to the Bridgestones, which had a longer window of consistent performance. This was a request from the FIA, in order to spice up the races by increasing the number of pit-stops. For 2017, they have reverted to harder tyres on which the drivers can push for a longer time without suffering thermal degradation. Anyways, back to the answer. In order to make an undercut work , the car which is chasing the car ahead has to stay within a certain time delta, like 1.5\u20132 seconds. As the car behind pits, and switches onto fresher tyres, it can use the extra grip to put in one or more flying laps while the car it is hoping to jump this way can't really pick up the pace as its tyres are past their best. As a result, when the original lead car pits, it loses its advantage due to lapping slowly with worn tyres while the guy who pit earlier put his newer tyres to full use. Henceforth, this results in the car behind getting the jump on the car ahead. To prevent an undercut,  the lead car\u2019s driver is usually instructed by his race engineer to pick up the pace and build a gap to the car behind, usually in the region of 3\u20134 seconds, depending upon the nature of the track, the time delta between different tyre compounds, and the relative competitiveness of the two cars. This way, even if the car behind pits a lap or two early, it can't jump the lead car as it has a time buffer which it can afford to lose without losing the lead of the race. Another way to counter this is to pit earlier than planned in the race strategy. This will catch the car behind unawares as the teams can only guess the estimated pit laps based upon practice and qualifying data. This does mean the car lead car pitting early has to extend one of its later tyre stints longer than ideally the team would like. But on tracks like Monaco, where track position is everything due to the difficulties in overtaking, this is an effective ploy. Footnote  : In years gone by, when refuelling was allowed, the undercut wasn't a viable option as cars were always fuelled light at the start of the race and each stop added fuel and hence, weight. In those days, the car hoping to jump a rival ahead of him on the track tried what we call an  overcut,  wherein   the car behind would stay out longer than the cars in front. As the cars pitting early would actually be slower for a few laps as a result of taking in more fuel, the guy staying out could put in a series of flying laps and cut any gaps he might have had. After his stop, he'd jump the guy in front. A lot of races were decided in the pits at that time, with very little on-track action, which is one of the reasons refuelling was banned. Since 2010, races have seen more overtaking than in the early 2000s. I can't really add too much to  Athithyan Chellappa\u2019 s great answer. The only thing I will add, is that once you have achieved track position by using the undercut, yes the car(s) you have overtaken through said manoeuvre will have fresher tyres, however, teams will normally calculate in a gap where there will be no cars in the vicinity once you have gone back onto the circuit. With that in mind, because you have the track space to yourself, the driver can normally push harder to negate the fact that the car(s) behind will have fresher tyres later and you are no longer being affected by \u2018dirty air\u2019. My understanding of the undercut is Team A (which is behind Team B) pits first, gets back on the race track in clear air. Team A driver puts in quick laps to take advantage of the situation in order to either close the advantage or leap frog Team B. Team B pits, gets out either in front or behind Team A. How to defend against this strategy - minimize the advantage of the team attempting the undercut. Open a very big gap, or pit as soon as the other team pits so that they don\u2019t get that much laps to close the gap. Let me explain it to you in layman terms. When you are driving the car, the tyres degrade with every passing lap. More the degradation, lesser the grip, lesser the speed through corners, more the lap time! Now what the undercut does is, it is helps you overtake the car or cars ahead of you effectively in the pit-stop phase. You pit before them and fit a new set or a lesser used set of tyres to usually go faster than them for as many laps as they stay out on track. Now because of your more grippier tyres, you will be able to close the gap on the person ahead significantly\u200b by doing better lap times than him. So, when they come in to have a change of tyres, you get past them without actually having to pass them on circuit. Countering this strategy is very easy. If you are the car ahead and guy behind you just pitted, you pit the very next lap to disable him from gaining enough time to get past you. Now that is considering both cars are on same strategy, if not, you will have to play it differently! Sometimes it doesn't work, sometimes it backfires if you get stuck in traffic, most of the time having position on track is better than making an early stop. You will see a lot of this in Monaco next time out. Cheers!",

        "a": "If you only want the \u2018Physics\u2019, skip the first paragraph. Any microphone - in this case your ear - has what is called a frequency response, which describes how well the mic responds (produces electrical or other output) to different frequencies, and a dynamic range, which talks about the quietest and loudest sounds that it can precisely measure. No microphone has infinite dynamic range or infinitely uniform frequency response. For the human ear (and the audio processing equipment such as the cochlea and YOUR BRAIN), 20kHz is considered to be approximately the highest sound detectable. This does not mean that all people can hear all frequencies up to 20kHz perfectly well and then beyond that can suddenly hear nothing, it just means that at frequencies around and beyond 20Hz, Humans\u2019 perception of sound drops off to where it is considered \u2018useless\u2019. There are many reasons for why frequency response of a mic falls off beyond some high point. I can think of mechanical, electrical and processing-related reasons. Low frequency sound waves have much higher amplitude than high-frequency waves for the same amount of energy/power. This means that they can apply much larger forces to a membrane (such as most types of microphones, including your ear, have) over a longer period of time (since time period is inversely proportional to frequency) than high frequency sound waves. Also with high frequency sound the membrane must oscillate more times per second - which means it must be put into motion, stopped, and put into reverse motion more times per second - which means that its speed needs to be changed much faster - which means more acceleration needs to be imparted to it - which means more force needs to be applied to it (remember, membranes have mass too). So high frequency sound applies less force to your eardrum but perception of high frequency sound  requires  higher force to be applied to your eardrum. Makes sense that beyond a certain point, your eardrum just won\u2019t move enough to create significant signals. The signals created by a microphone, if they are electric, which the signals created by your ear are, will be diminished due to the inductance of the conductor that carries the signal away fro the microphone, and any capacitive coupling that may happen between its terminals - and this happens more as frequency increases, so beyond a certain point you\u2019ll be losing a lot of your signal like this. Finally and possibly most importantly, your audio processing device, here, a part of your brain, can only process audio to a certain resolution. As frequency gets higher, there are more oscillations per second and therefore just more  information  per second, and your brain has to work faster and faster to keep up with it - beyond a point, it gives up. Can all people hear 20-20,000 Hz sounds? Why don\u2019t I hear the sound I want on the piano? Is human hearing in the range 20-20,000 Hz or 64-23,000 Hz? We humans are capable of hearing only in the 20 - 20,000 Hz range. Are we capable of emitting sound outside this range? Do cats hear up to 79,000 or 64,000 Hz? In general terms, the frequency range for human hearing is about 20 Hz - 20,000 Hz (at least in \u201cnormal hearing young adults\u201d). The response of the ear is governed, in part, by the mass and elasticity of the eardrum, muscles and ligaments, bones, and fluid and structures in the inner ear. Elasticity opposes low frequency sounds, while mass opposition increases as frequency increases. So both mass and elasticity set limits for frequency range. As an interesting aside, an object will resonate at a frequency where elastic opposition has decreased and mass opposition isn\u2019t too high. For human ears, its about 2000\u20134000 Hz. So those frequencies are amplified for us\u2026important, because that\u2019s the range where speech sounds are heard to maximize understanding of speech. The others have given the mechanics, so I'll limit myself to one fact - some humans (teens, autistic people and possibly others) can hear up to 24,000 Hz just fine. It's why the Mosquito teen-repelling sound that turned into a teen-popularized ringtone (which works at that frequency) works. Our ears have a diaphragm/ ear drum that vibrates along with the sound waves. As a general rule of thumb the bigger the diaphragm the slower it can move which limits its top speed and the high frequencies. A mouse/bat/bird/cat/dog has smaller diaphragms which can move quicker allowing them to hear higher frequencies. Hearing those high frequencies are useful to them in their smaller sized worlds. For human purposes there is very little useful information above 20,000 Hz anyway so we never evolved to hear it. Around 20,000 is usually considered the top frequency that humans can hear although at reduced sensitivity after about 17,000 Hz. And that is when we are young but as we all age we lose our ability to hear more of the top end. some humans can because of geneicts like me. however its because of how we are born",

You break down each element into a set of technical capabilities and look for (or more likely; already know) what technologies will work to that end. ie: if stealth to a certain level is a requirement, you find all the preceding designs, technologies and existing components that meet or just exceed that stealth level. Same with total weight which defines the type and power of the engine(s) and the rotor system, for a helicopter. Same with any special equipment, ie: guns and radios, etc. Then you have design trade-off sessions, which takes months, going back and forth with various solutions to the myriad of problems that will occur mixing various technologies and designs. If any part is changed for any reason, it almost always affects the other parts it is assembled with, and then they too need a redesign. When you get close to a consensus amongst the dozens of chief engineers and the client, you have a preliminary design review (PDR). This is a very major milestone in the design. Each element is reviewed for multiple parameters before it is approved. The manufacturing process for each part is also reviewed, most is well known but there may be something new, like 3D Printing (Additive Manufacturing - AM) that needs special attention. After a clean PDR initial prototype parts can be made and tested. There is still a lot of redesign occurring at the detailed level, but the plane is pretty well defined. After all that the next major, if not THE major milestone happens, the Critical Design Review (CDR) which like the PDR goes over every part and manufacturing process in detail. When the CDR is complete, the design is frozen. Prototype parts are made and the prototype airplane is built from those parts. Then there months/years of testing, on the ground and in the air to make sure it really works, meets the clients requirements and won\u2019t fall apart in extreme use.

Chinese investment projects include roads, bridges, ports, pipelines, rails, and tunnels funded by Chinese foreign exchange reserves and Chinese-back international institutions. China is motivated by its search for an outlet for excess industrial capacity to improve its economic situation, as well as its desires to bolster its position as an international trade powerhouse and sidestep US Navy superiority. The initiative has gained the support of the UN and continues to expand into new countries despite various setbacks. If you\u2019d like a more detailed explanation, you can check out the article on  The Modern Envoy - Global Affairs Explained Simply Why there is no Indian projects like one belt one road? What exactly is the one road one belt plan? Does India need to be a part of the Belt and Road initiative? Read the details. What is One Belt One Road? What does it mean by \"One Belt One Road\" with respect to China? After China develops itself to certain stage, it is time for China to go out. China believes that some of the Chinese success can be replicated in certain parts of the world. If some parts of the world learn from China and become prosperous, then there are more demands from these places, and China can make more money. China genuinely believes that you do not get richer by making the others poor, you get richer when others also gets richer. China always plans its moves. It foresaw its economic power many years ago and planned accordingly. It needs a label/image that the other countries can understand. No label is better than \u201cSilk Road\u201d. So OBOR is the umbrella terms for Chinese intention to fully and deeply engage in the world in economics. The domination of the world is not the primary motivation of Chinese. From the history of many empires, China fully understands that it is futile to conquer the world by force. The only way to have a lasting peace and prosperity is to get rich together. If it turns out that China dominates in this process, so be it. If it turns out that India or some other country dominates, China can also live with that as long as it does not hurt China economically.",

[1] If public debt becomes negligible (ignoring some necessary short term borrowing), government can choose to lower the tax it raises or allocate this extra \u00a346 billion to other areas. In terms of revenue raised, the interest cost is 88% of corporation tax revenue , nearly a third of VAT and a quarter of income tax. In terms of expenditure, the interest cost is 96% of defense, 45% of education and 30% of NHS expenditure. The above is only approximate though since the situation is muddied by Quantitative Easing program (QE) run by Bank of England. The bank, through its subsidiary Asset Purchase Facility Fund (APF), is a large buyer of government bonds in the market and currently holds a quarter of all UK government bonds. This has undoubtedly kept government borrowing cost lower. If normal conditions restore and QE is stopped then interest payment will be more than \u00a346 billion (newer borrowing cost will rise). Second thing to consider is that some of the interest payment treasury makes to APF, is paid back to the treasury, lowering borrowing requirement and net debt servicing cost. It works like this  [2]  - APF borrows from Bank of England at the base rate (currently 0.25%) It then buys government bond from the market and receives interest payment on these from the treasury. It uses the interest payment to pay for its own cost and pay the Bank of England interest on the sum it borrowed. Since the bank base rate is much lower than gilt yields (of all durations), APF ends up with surplus cash. Since 2012, after keeping a small buffer, APF pays back the extra cash to treasury, lowering government borrowing requirement. If the above arrangement disappears, government borrowing requirement and debt servicing cost will rise. In 2016, APF paid back to treasury \u00a313 billion.

What is the difference between England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Britain, Great Britain, United Kingdom, the British Islands, and the British... Is it true that reducing public spending makes the debt grow? Is UK government debt unsustainable? What would happen if it was not brought down? History: How did the UK pay down its post-war government debt? Can government debt be good? Currently debt service, i.e. the interest on the national debt, is around 8% of the tax raise , which amounts to around \u00a343 billion in 2015. So that money would be available to spend on other things if there was no public debt. However there is a large budget deficit that has persisted since 2009\u201310, which has arisen from the shortfall in the tax raise and other income meeting the spending commitments. Reality check: How big is the UK's deficit and debt? - BBC News The current deficit is around \u00a3 53 billion this year, and that is money the government will have to borrow to pay its bills. The current debt outstanding is around \u00a31,700 billion and has risen by \u00a3700 billion since 2010. My major criticism of the government debt and deficit is most of the rise in national debt has been used to pay for tax shortfalls. It would have been possible to spend less and stimulate the economy more by investing in infrastructure which is the classic Keynesian approach to economic crashes. The coalition government and by extension the current government chose to adopt the now discredited research from Rogoff and Rheinhart on debt to GDP ratios as the rationale for austerity. Pro-Austerity Research Now Even More Thoroughly Trashed Which lead to the austerity drive rather than \u201cpriming the pump\u201d approach of demand side economics. So the money to me seems to have just been wasted on servicing tax shortfalls rather than trying to stimulate the economy. Typical infrastructure spends would include: roads bridges solar power hospitals/research centres but should now include faster internet, 5G tax incentives for start up businesses. Additionally the government could have renationalised low value for money services such as rail, but this would a) be anathema to the libertarian element of the Tory party and b) have to recognise the failure of existing policy. Interesting idea. If there were no public debt there would be no money. That's what money is. Its debt. If you own one pound, you own one pound of the UK public debt. So, now there's no money. Wow. I imagine there has been a bit of a fight getting people to part with their cash. I expect the government has realised its error and is going to borrow back the money to pay everyone back OR It could recreate all the money this time but without interest. Currently the government prints interest bearing bonds and sells them to banks for money which it then spends. This is an artificial construct designed by bankers so that they get a skim of every penny the government creates. It's the fantastic wet dream of every banker & they still can't believe they're getting away with it & no one has noticed. Instead of \"securitising\" the debt, the government could simply print money without debt. Or more accurately it would simply instruct the BOE to electronically credit everyone's accounts. So now, we have a situation where we have money (debt) but we have no interest payment, which is the bit that you're interested in. BTW the purpose of taxation is not to raise revenue. Your tax money is destroyed by the government. Burned. Deleted. The purpose of taxation is to draw money out of the economy to prevent inflation (demand exceeding supply). The government can spend (create) as much money as it likes so long as it uses it to create goods or services to soak up the money it creates. Money creation = goods & services = happiness Money creation > goods & services = Zimbabwe The government could create 12 billion pounds and spend it right now in the NHS and all that would happen is that more work would be done, more tax would be paid, the countries GDP would increase. The real question is... why won't they? Who would benefit from people not being employed? Who would benefit from the population being kept poor?",

What are some of the most mind-blowing facts about the United Kingdom? What would happen if England left the United Kingdom? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve picked these stations because they\u2019re among the least used stations on the network. Shippea Hill only has one service a day. As long as you catch the train at 07.28 you can get to Reddish South in 5.5\u20136 hours which isn\u2019t bad for a cross-country journey with 3 changes. The biggest danger would be getting back as the return journey takes just under 22 hours and you might die of boredom. Shippea Hill: just 'one person a month' uses UK's quietest train station Don't listen to them! At the last count only about 8% of those who attempt that journey get there alive. After crossing the swamps you have to climb the big scary mountains that are actually volcanoes. Then there are the big horrid man-eating wossnames, followed by the acid rain. A few miles of shark infested waters crossed using a really badly built bridge, and after that the massive minefield and the UK nuclear proving grounds. There are 6 regional war zones that need to be crossed, and then a desert. It all gets a bit supernatural after that, what with the werewolves and vampires and wotnot. You then have The Plain of Utter Agony (don't ask!), various Terminator style dystopias and finally a whole load of really deadly plants. Whatever you do, DON'T LEAVE THE TRAIN. Good Luck. What is all this nonsense about the dangers of travelling on British trains about? The first time I saw one of these I thought it slightly amusing, but now they're just stupid. I wonder if it's getting dangerous to repeat the same question on websites, hoping for a different answer?

        "a": "The most fundamental principle of astrology is that of Karakas and their behaviors. Almost all other aspects of astrology are derivation of the planetary Karakatwas, including the lordships, exaltation, debilitation, avasthas, and everything. Karakas are basically causative planets for any area/activity. It is because of the karaka planets and their interactions with others that results come to pass. The delegation of karakatwas is studied through the Parashari system of houses or the Jaimini system of char karakas. Karakatwas are significations of a planet that get activated depending on a lot of factors. If a planet owns the 10th house, it acts as an individual karaka for career, commonly known as the house lord. If a planet has the highest degree in Rashi chart, it becomes the atma-karaka by virtue of movable-karakatwas of planets. Same way, if it associates with similar types of planets, signs, etc. it becomes the karaka of that particular activity/object. Same way, depending on the time of the day, time of the year, hour of the day, age of the person, nature of life etc. the same planets change their karakattwas with time and with place. Thus giving the 9 planets the ability to ascertain every single incident in life by a clear understanding of karakas. It is impossible to give a detailed description of karakas in just one article. An entire book would be required to describe the importance of karakas and it would need volumes to explain the various karakatwas and how they work. In a nutshell, this is what karakas are. What is Rahu in Vedic astrology? What does Harsha Bala mean in Vedic astrology? Do I need to wear a gemstone according to vedic astrology? If yes, then which one? How can I know my birth time using Vedic astrology? How do Rahu and Ketu affect us in Vedic astrology? Hello there, karakas are of two types. 1.Sthir Karaka. 2.Chara Karaka. Sthir Karaka: It is basically used in Parashari Astrology but is accepted in other methods of Astrology aslo. Here simply each planet is given a portfolio like Sun is karaka of Father Moon is for mother etc. Same way all planets have a long list of karakas which ranges from living to non living things. These karaka will remain same for everyone and when afflicted or weak tend to harm the portfolio or significations associated with that karaka for example a afflicted Sun will lead to bad relationship with father and here one need to understand that condition of 9th house and its Lord will also have say in the final result related with father. Charkaraka : Charkarakas tend to change from horoscope to horoscope and are identified in following manner: 1.Atmakaraka(planet with highest degree). 2.Amatyakaraka(planet with second highest degree). 3.Bhartikaraka(planet with third highest degree ). 4.Matrikaraka(planet with fourth highest degree). 5.Putrakaraka(planet with fifth highest degree). 6.Ganatikaraka(planet with sixth highest degree) 7.Darakaraka(planet with least degree). if you are familiar with internet then a lot of information is available everywhere or you may buy any book which should not cost much",

        "a": "Throughout the ages, cultures and religions have tried to stamp out homosexuality. How may we explain its endurance through the lens of evolution? Although homosexuality seems to have epigenetic components resulting in women who gave birth to boys more likey having homosexual children afterwards, homosexuality seems to be an acquired, not an inherited property. Homosexuality seems to be linked to hormone level fluctuations in the mother during certain phases of pregnancy. These fluctuations can have countless causes beginning with stress and ending with alcohol abuse. Therefore they can hardly be avoided which again leads to a fairly constant ratio of gay people of approximately 5%. This also means that while you are born gay, you are not conceived gay. Homosexuality is not inherited but a result of omnipresent, uncontrollable environmental influences and with that no direct subject to evolution, no matter how hard cultures have tried to eradicate it. How do you explain evolution to a 10-year-old? Does evolution explain why we sleep? Is culture a result of evolution? Does evolution say life began randomly on earth? How does evolution explain the birth of birds? >Throughout the ages, cultures and religions  >have tried to stamp out homosexuality. No. SOME cultures and religions have been hostile to homosexuality, but not all, or even most. Once you get outside of the areas dominated by the Abrahamic religions, you tend to see less hate and fear directed towards homosexuals. Remember that the Abrahamic religions were not as widespread in the past as they are now. Homosexuality is a natural variation within human sexuality. It has been around for as long as we have written records, and was not always seen as problematic. In some cultures it was even seen as the norm during certain periods of a person\u2019s life. The idea of two genders isn\u2019t even universal. There is one culture today that recognizes five genders, and has for centuries or longer. Three-gender cultures were not unknown in certain times and places, as well. Throughout history, cultures have varied from aversion, indiference, acceptance and compulsory requirement for homosexuality. There is no common cultural or religious norm. Its endurance for human survival is not hard to explain - Love thy brother. Because when you do that, people defending against a common enemy are less likely to break and run. Well that was the theory anyway. Also, people weren't stupid. Homosexual or not, men and women understood their familial duty to have offspring. I agree with Christian Winter. The simplest way to look at this is that in any given population, there will be a percentage of people who are \u201cotherly sexed\u201d in various ways, including being homosexual. Much the same as a percentage is left-handed or green-eyed or whatever. These things are relatively neutral from an evolutionary standpoint. Note that for the many cultures through history that have condemned homosexuality, as many more have been quite accepting or been quite neutral on the subject. As well, there is a degree of hypocrisy involved in some of these cultures. Just as a for-instance, it\u2019s well-understood that in Afghanistan, the culture is strongly Islamic and homosexuality is strongly frowned on. At the same time, relationships with women outside of being actually married are strongly condemned as well. So, in many of the \u201ctribal\u201d areas, the custom of having \u201ccomfort boys\u201d is widespread. This is not viewed as homosexual behavior, with the participants somehow rationalizing what they are doing as acceptable within their culture. My original question ( - too long): If we accept that homosexuality has a genetic component (in addition to environmental factors), and given that homosexuality has endured (in spite of rigorous efforts to root and stamp it out) throughout the ages - may we infer that there may be some evolutionary advantage in having a proportion of homosexuals in your tribe? And given that homophobia is enshrined in so many cultures and religions, and if we accept that traditions generally stem from historic human sentiment and intuition - what is the evolutionary explanation for the prevelance of homophobia?",

In order to be successful you have to be consistent and be prepared to put in a lot of time. If you\u2019re prepared to stay the course and grow a blog, here are some quick tips. Be Consistent -  Stay consistent with your blog posts. You don\u2019t have to write posts every single day, but you should come up with a schedule that works for you and stick with it. It could be weekly, bi-weekly or even monthly. Build Relationships -  Relationships are extremely important when it comes to growing a blog and an audience. It\u2019s very hard to do things alone, especially in the beginning. Focus on networking with other people in your niche. Don\u2019t view them as competition. Talk to people on social media and help them where you can. Over time you\u2019ll start to see people sharing your stuff. Use Social Media -  Social media is one of the best ways to get traffic to your blog. You should focus on growing a following on just 1 or 2 platforms to begin with. One of the biggest mistakes I see is people trying to be active and grow an audience on every social media platform they can. This doesn\u2019t work because of the lack of focus. Some of the more popular ones you should look at are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Youtube. Build a following on a couple of those platforms and share your blog content there as you release it. Write Solid Content -  Make sure all the content you put out is unique, high-quality and shareable. Don\u2019t waste your time with posts that are full of fluff. Focus on providing unique content. People share stuff that they haven\u2019t seen a million times over. Provide as much value in your content as you can. You\u2019re better off spending 6 hours on one good post than spend 30 minutes on a bunch of garbage posts. Learn Basic SEO -  Search Engine Optimization is a great way to generate free traffic. It does take time but will be the most sustainable traffic you\u2019ll find. Learn some basic SEO techniques in order to get your posts ranked highly on the major search engines. For Wordpress users there\u2019s a plugin called  Yoast SEO  that\u2019s really helpful with SEO. Learn to do basic keyword research and include strong keywords in your posts. Have A Focus -  You want to make sure your blog is focused on a single topic. You need to know who your audience is and write specifically for them. If you try to please everyone you\u2019re pleasing no-one. In the beginning it can be tempting to just write about anything, but avoid that urge. Pick your niche and stick with it. There are some basic practices you should follow when growing your blog. For more information about blogging and traffic growth I urge you to join this  free Facebook group.

At the same time whenever there are new additions to programming languages, users tempted or liked to move towards them. It is nothing harm in that as well. Until Unless we have the customization, portability, easy usage, any language is well efficient. Additionally let us see the below points as well Interchangeability With Java One of Kotlin\u2019s greatest strengths as a potential alternative to Java is the sheer level of interoperability between Java and Kotlin\u2014you can even have Java and Kotlin code existing side by side in the same project, and everything will still compile perfectly. So we can mix Kotlin and Java together. interoperability is the main concept and hence for an app, if java and Kotlin developers are mixed, whichever routine easily built, they can build it in either Java/Kotlin. Kotlin lovers can follow this post Java vs. Kotlin: Should You Be Using Kotlin for Android Development? But my wishlist is always Java. https://www.facebook.com/priyara... How does Kotilin being the new official language for Android development affect Java? Why did Google announce Kotlin for Android instead of GoLang or some other? Why did Android change its official language to Kotlin? What should I learn now, Java or Kotlin in order to develop Android apps? Do I learn Kotlin or Java for Android? After Oracle's copyrights and patents claim on Google's\u200b Android OS [1] , all of us were predicting that Google will opt out from Java. Most of us were thinking of Go [2]  language (might be there primary language in near future). So yes they are trying to opt out from Java by introducing Kotlin. Now coming to the question, as per Android Developer website [3] , Kotlin works with Java seamlessly. For now you don't have to worry about Java, you can java as previously. What I personally think that Kotlin will replace Java as primary language however Java will be there to developers to develop. Note: Take this as a great opportunity to learn new language.

        "a": "India's jobs problem is not restricted to a few companies, mostly in the information technology (IT) sector, laying off workers due to the US visa restrictions and automation. It is a problem endemic to our economy and not the result of global trends. The jobs problem is seen mainly as a problem of the IT sector or as a result of changing technology. That's not the complete truth. India's jobs deficit emerges from bigger, long-term phenomenon. Below are the reasons why we should worry more about macro-economic factors than a few companies laying off workers. 1. More supply than demand   India has the largest number of young people in the world, adding nearly 10 million new workers to the workforce annually. That\u2019s equivalent to roughly the entire population of the Czech Republic or Portugal. A 2014 CRISILBSE 0.10 % study expects India to create just 38 million non-agricultural jobs between 2011 and 2019. The number of workers seeking jobs far outstrips supply of jobs. . 2. Unemployment or unemployability?   India is staring at an employability crisis. Of the 10 lakh engineers a year, more than 90% are unemployable. This even as new technologies like AI-VR, machine learning and data science pose fresh challenges. 3. The export problem   Amid protectionist policies, global trade remains subdued (2.4% is volume terms in 2017 by WTO). China became the world's factory to employ its millions. India may not have that option. 4. Agri versus non-agri jobs   CRISIL estimates that 12 million people will join the agriculture workforce between 2011-12 and 2018-19 as against a decline of 37 million in agriculture employment between 2004-04 and 2011-12. Agriculture contributes around 15% to India\u2019s GDP but employs a massive 45% of the workforce. And this turn towards agri-jobs does not forebode well for a country trying to move up the value chain to grow faster.Bear in mind that this shift to low-productivity jobs comes amid rising literacy levels (from 64.8% in 2001 to 74% in 2011) and surging aspirations. 5. Jobless growth   The economy shows no signs of distress, growing rather well at around 7% plus. But it could well be the wrong proxy for job creation. Research by CRISIL shows that for the last three years, three sectors have outpaced GDP growth: financial services, real estate and professional services; public administration, defence and community services; and trade, hotels and restaurants. Except for the third, others have low-labour intensity. Sectors with a substantive share in employment \u2014 agriculture, construction and manufacturing \u2014 have been lagging overall GDP growth. Sections of experts have prefixed India\u2019s economic growth with \u2018jobless'. 6. Rising wages   The relative advantage of wage arbitrage that once buoyed job-generating sectors like BPO has been declining. India was, till 10-15 years ago, the world\u2019s back office with GE and American Express leading the wave. But now, as wages in India rise, MNCs are shifting work to cheaper destinations. American Express, for example, is migrating a lot of its back-office work to the Philippines. 7. No sunrise sectors   Unlike in the past, when one sector matured and faded in its hiring buoyancy, new sunrise sectors took its place, absorbing and retraining workers. For example, after IT services came telecom and organised retail. Now, at least so far, there is a virtual absence of sunrise sectors that hold out hope for job seekers.

        "a": "What should you do, depends on your choice. However, I can objectively give you some idea about nature of work as an ATC, that may help you make a decision. To make such a choice, regarding switching of job, the factors of consideration include salary, job profile, future prospects and most importantly nature of job (whether it is enjoyable or not). Assuming that you do have an idea about salary structure, I prefer to talk more about the other prospects of job. The job is dynamic and thrilling, mostly application of aptitude and situational awareness in taking quite witted decisions, and you will get appropriate training, courses and simulated practices, before performing this job actually, no pre-requisite is required at the time of joining. Other factors that may be of consideration for you: As you may have heard, the job is considered \u201cstressful\u201d, actually it is said so because it is a high responsibility job (since we are dealing with planes). However to keep the mind active and alleviate any kind of stress or fatigue, there is a provision of frequent breaks, for example, 45 mins. break after 1.5 hours of duty, or 1 hour break after 2 hours duty. The job is transferrable. The country is divided into 5 regions: Delhi (N), Mumbai (W), Kolkata (E), Chennai(S), and Guwahati(N.E.) An ATCO has to undergo a tenure of 5 continuous years of his career in a region outside his home region. Plus one or two years tenure at a unpopular station. (Which is located a little far from residential areas and may not have basic facilities like schools, markets etc nearby) Work timings: Generally most airports operate 24*7, to cater to the perpetual air traffic, so the employees work in a 5 day roster system (and not 9 to 5, weekends off pattern). It includes: Morning shift of approximately 6 hrs on day 1. Afternoon shift of approximately 6 hrs on day 2. Night shift on night between day 3 and day 4. (Around 12 hours) 4th day (morning onwards) and 5th day (complete) free. (Called as night off and clear off) Night shifts (however) don't mean you have to slog whole night. Night shift is divided into two half portions and there are 2 ATCOs manning a position alternately, while they may sleep in the rest room, during free time. Initially an ATC officer is not deployed at positions which involve risks or actual decision making. He can learn under his seniors and once he gains confidence he is promoted to work at those positions subjected to a viva and practical test. This is called getting rated.  There is a provision of stress allowance (based on the traffic frequency of the station) and rating allowance,  as perks. You don't get holidays on festivals like Diwali, Holi etc but in lieu of them you get Casual leaves in your account. Which you may avail as per need or wish any time of the year (with prior intimation). As per your seniority (ie.your rank in the entrance exam), you get promotion calls. In approx 3\u20135 years you get promoted to Assistant Manager. Then later Mgr, Senior Mgr, DGM, JGM, GM etc. Due to shift patterns, you get ample time to persue your hobbies and further goals. Having off on weekdays also means you can have crowd free and cheap outings with family. However, one demerit is that you have to wait for your night off and clear off to coincide with weekends to catch up with your non-ATC friends. So, you may consider these factors and weigh them against the prospects of your IT job. All the best\u2026!",

Google some HIIT exercises you can do at home as these only lasts for a short period of time and is very effective, MUCH more effective than running so no need to worry. The only thing you need to do to lose weight is to be at a calorie deficit, healthy or unhealthy, you're going to lose weight if you eat 1500 calories from salads or 1500 from chips, BUT it will be difficult because. Most junk foods are densely packed with calories. You can eat 4 large cucumbers and it will be the same as eating 21 pieces of Cheetos.  Nobody eats just 21 pieces of Cheetos and feel satisfied. Junk food is addictive because of all the added sugar. The more you feed your cravings for it, the more it demands, so it's likely you'll suffer and eventually give up. Your health will be adversely affected if you do not get the nutrients your body needs. Why exactly can't you go out? If you mean you can't afford it because junk is generally cheaper, try to buy fruits and vegetables in season as these are cheaper and fresh, and BULK THE HELL UP ON FROZEN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES! Best wishes! What are the best foods to eat when you want to lose weight? How one can lose weight without going to the gym? How do I stop eating junk food? How can I stop eating unhealthy and fatty food? I want to lose weight even though I am not very fat. When we lose weight, where does it go? You can do lots of exercise in your house. Here\u2019s an example. You might look at a clock, and when the second hand gets to 0 start running in place as fast as you can. Lift those knees high! When it gets to 20, start jogging in place very gently. When it gets to 20, go back to energetic. Keep up that pattern, ten seconds exercising intensely and ten seconds gently. Keep doing that for a full ten minutes. That\u2019s called HIIT,  high intensity interval training , and it\u2019s a very effective form of exercise. If you get to the point where you\u2019re doing the above for ten minutes each day, you\u2019ll be in much better cardiovascular shape then you are now. You could even go for twenty or thirty minutes a day\u2014just build up to it gradually, don\u2019t hurt yourself. Now, of course you won\u2019t be able to do it for ten minutes right at the beginning, you need to start out gently. You might start out by doing it for only a minute once a day, and gradually increase your time over the course of several weeks, or even months. You want to build up your strength? Hey,  pushups  don\u2019t require any space to speak of, and no equipment but the floor. You could also do  squats ,  lunges , and  Australian pullups . (The last one requires a good sturdy table.) Gradually build up\u2014by the time you\u2019re doing, say, 100 of each, you\u2019ll be plenty strong. I don\u2019t know what grocery stores you\u2019ve got nearby, but legumes\u2014beans, peas, lentils\u2014are healthy, cheap, and pretty easy to come by, in my experience. Add some carrots, tomatoes, peppers, and you\u2019re good. Good luck! Running and going to the gym aren\u2019t necessarily the best ways to lose weight. You can do bodyweight exercises from home. Many bodyweight exercises are more efficient than running. There are some exercises you can even do from bed! Try looking up instructions and videos for \u201cbody weight exercises\u201d. Body weight exercises include push-ups, leg lifts, burpees, planks, and so on. Furthermore, even if you can\u2019t change what you eat, you can try eating less. By changing your mindset. Begin with cut half of what you eat, believe me you can survive. Eat slowly, chew every bite 10\u201312 times. Drink one large glass of water before starting to eat, this way water will fill your stomach. You can work out on your own without any equipment as well. Try to increase your heartrate every 30 minutes or one hour max. by walking, running, climb ladder or just jump for 1\u20132 minutes. It will increase your heartrate and your body will start to burn faster. I know it will be hard at the beginning but by the time you\u2019ll see the results in your body, you will be more eager to do more. Hardest part is changing your mindset and starting.",

From there you can see the Padres stadium and downtown San Diego Roof top on the Andaz: it has a bar/dance floor, about 8 cabanas, 3 semi-private room, a fire pit and a swimming pool it all overlooks down town. Cabrillo National Monument: Is the highest point in San Diego. It features an old light house, a magnificent view overlooking San Diego and on the lower side of it you have the cliffs. Sunset cliffs: offers a long stretch of cliffs with a brilliant sunset. There's even a part of it with a trail and a cave that leads you down to the rocks. There's also a diving spot where people jump off into the water below. Balboa Park: Contains botanical gardens, museums and art galleries. Depending on what time you go, there might be a free outdoor concert and food. This is usually during the festival of lights a few days before Christmas. Mount Soledad: Is another vantage point overlooking San Diego. It features a gigantic white cross. There are lots of other places around San Diego which I don't feel like describing right now but those 6 are my favorite ones. Others are Torrey Pines (hiking along side the beach), black beach ( paragliding, hiking and nudity), U.S.S. Midway (a retired carrier with a museum), There's also a boat tour near the mid-way, bluefoot (a hidden bar with a nearby speed boat rental), USD campus, La Jolla cove, Fashion valley mall (has a movie theater) Salk institute (features great architecture layout that captures a great sunset. It's near black beach in La Jolla. If you are visiting, don't know anyone and want to meet a variety of foreigners I would recommend staying at Lucky D hostel.

Seriously, it\u2019s so beautiful, I actually cried the first time I went there. Torrey Pines Beach is personally my favourite because it feels more secluded than the rest with it\u2019s cliffs and small stretches of sand. A close runner up is La Jolla but it\u2019s more crowded. Depends what you mean by \u201cViews of san diego\u201d and if you want to be doing anything specific (like eating) or just going STRICTLY for the view. Getting a good view of the downtown skyline is pretty easy, you can go all over from the coronado ferry landing to places like shelter or harbor island. There are restaraunts in all 3 locations that give you great views while you eat too, like island prime and the bali hai. As other\u2019s have said places like point loma have a good overall view of SD bay. But you can also get interesting views of downtown in the hills behind it, like from the cabrillio bridge in balboa park. Or out in the residential areas like going up Curlew street in bankers hill, or Pringle street over in mission hills too. The best view, i think, is from Coronado At night. There is an area called The Ferry Landing (there's a ferry from there to downtown) that has shops and restaurant. You can see the skyline with the downtown buildings and their lights. Whenever I'm there, I feel so lucky to live in San Diego. From Point Loma. Top of Cowles Mountain. The Coronado Bridge at night. The Crystal pier at Pacific Beach. Shelter Island beach at night.",

Even if you decide never to upgrade to a newer version, the money you put in Magento customization could prove to be a dead investment in couple of years time, primarily because you have to match up to ever changing market demands. Consider this, you set up a marketplace which means you are extending part of your system to your vendors. Based on their experience, you would need to make changes into vendor panel from time to time. Such changes can be as minute as changing configuration file, or can be as big as needing to radically change the UI/UX. I am only talking about a very small challenge here. Do you have any action plan for this and other such challenges? As a user, you will not understand the intricacies of technology but as a solution provider, techies like me have to find answers to immediate and future challenges. Honestly I am yet to come across a major marketplace that uses Magento extension and so that gives me absolutely no confidence to recommend anyone to use a ready extension. To give you an example, one of my clients needed us to develop a B2B marketplace using an opensource solution like Magento. After nearly six months of brainstorming and evaluating all the possible options, we developed  PurchaseMantra.com , from ground up. After all the exercise that we did evaluating various options to develop the marketplace, I can now confidently tell you that Magento is no sweet answer to your requirement. Why because systems are developed to grow everyday, to evolve into a much better platform for its users including buyers and vendors. Therefore the underlying technology should be developer friendly, which doesn\u2019t restrict developers to write code within given parameters. My opinion, consider other technology options as well for your startup.",

I would highlight a few trends that are sprouting today and will become very visible in next few years. Given the disruptive nature of technology , among other things , large scale firms will need to be very agile to remain relevant. This means innovation and intrapreneurship will take higher priority. Most management courses are designed to manage scale of operations for maximum efficiency and profitability. This holds valid when organisations operate in semi stable economic environment. The tech environment has now made possible to globalise and scale using your desktop - Facebook, Uber, Airbnb are examples of growth possibilities with hardly any capital requirement. Here the disruption was around business model.Many large firms have disappeared because they were too busy managing short term results. 40% of Fortune 500 companies of year 2000 are no longer there on that list. Given such successes and growth opportunities , conventional management operations will get automated for maximum efficiency and jobs will shift from functional expertise to integrated skills in large corporates transitioning towards intrapreneurship. This would also mean taking risks and trying out ideas with even 10% probability of success - Amazon follows this. Risk taking is a leadership issue. Such like trends would mean specialized knowledge on entrepreneurship and leadership will equip the person for a turbulent future as competitive forces will allow 1 major player per category - e.g Google for Search, Uber , Airbnb, Amazon, Microsoft. The remaining players would get relegated to smaller players riding on the infrastructure platform of the big players. Would I do this course , if I were you ? My inclination would be yes I would.",

If they are not, and merely a codependent to another narc, they  might just  listen to you PROVIDED they are in complete  no contact mode  from the narcissist themselves. How can one know whether he/she is narcissistic? How do I act around my narcissistic wife now that I know she is one? Is there any way to prove to my ex that I do not have NPD? I lied and hurt her. She is convinced that I am a narcissist because of this. Will a narcissist ever realise that they are the problem and seek help? I wish my narcissistic ex husband's new fianc\u00e9 to get what's coming to her. She said I deserved the abuse when I tried to warn her. Am I being... Do you have children in common? If you do then you should put forward any kind of advice. It's in your kids' best interest that their mother gets all the help possible. Even in that case you'd better convey the message through a reliable third party. But if you don't have kids and you have no real reason outside your head to stay in touch, then you should put yourself and your well being first once and for all and enforce the no contact rule to the fullest. Zero means zero. Nada. None. Not a single bit. Rien. I could repeat it forever until you get the picture. And yes she might be suffering but not for her condition. Only for having lost a source of narcissistic supply. It'll go away the minute she finds a new victim. And if it doesn't it's not your fault. If you were abused emotionally by a narcissist who fortunately is now your ex, it's time to rewire your brain to your new situation, which is that of a free individual to look after himself. Yes. I personally think you should advice them. Maybe just for your own peace of mind. Try giving this advice in the least confrontational manner. And don\u2019t hold it against yourself if she doesn\u2019t follow your advice. Also, please keep in mind that there is not much any outsider can do for her if she doesn\u2019t want help. Don\u2019t lose yourself and get caught up in her manipulative ways while trying to help her. Take care of yourself first. You can\u2019t pour from an empty cup. They may go see a therapist for a little while but then again they may not. I feel strongly that my ex already knew he had a problem long before he ever sought help. Even when seeking help he continued to engage in his behaviors so what\u2019s the point, you have to wonder. They have to acknowledge the problem is a detriment to their life, take the initiative themselves, and follow through. Otherwise they don\u2019t really want to be helped, even though I would agree, especially with covert narcissists, that they are truly suffering. No leave her alone. If you care for her stop calling her names you do not know how she is feeling or why. You are broke up and it sounds like she is much better off without you. Don't tell her anything. Go on about your life. Sounds like you may think that she is sad to be without you. I don't know for sure but she will be living HER life without you just fine. Leave her alone and don't gossip or talk about her anymore. Also nothing on line. Thank you for asking. Be kind to yourself .",

The younger generation has done nothing to deserve the financial mess it inherited - predatory capitalists of our generation created it, not 20 year olds. Sheesh. Stop being angry at people who have a different worldview. No, Christians are not being persecuted in America. We know this because there are exactly 0 laws filed in the last 240 years attempting to limit Christian practice of religion. There are a few that limit Christians practice of  forcing  others to adhere to/comply with their religious beliefs but that is not persecution. Persecution is forcing others to adhere to/comply with our religious beliefs. Men are not being femininzed because we recognize they have the right to have emotions other than anger. They are not being treated unfairly because they aren\u2019t handed a sexual partner at puberty. Men still hold the vast majority of financial, political, social and legal power in the world.

What can I do to improve myself every day? What is one thing that happens only in your country? What are the small things one can do to improve as a man? Become a better, more satisfied person yourself, and teach others. There are a few obvious realities that can help you improve life. \u00a7 You have never met anyone who is exactly like you. \u00a7 You need food, water, oxygen from the environment. \u00a7 What you do makes a difference. \u00a7 You can have realizations about your life whenever you expand your awareness. \u00a7 Life keeps changing, and doesn\u2019t stop. \u00a7 These simple realities are true for Christians, Muslims, Jains, Sikhs, atheists, engineers, cigar rollers, taxi drivers, judges. \u00a7 When you think-act in ways consistent with  all  these obvious, yet often ignored realities, you optimize your life. What\u2019s Certain by William Ranger on Who controls you? One thing would be to treat everyone fairly. Like a human being should be treated. When I describe a human being I mean children, adults, elderly, disabled, amputee, a patient with some kind of illness, rich, poor, ugly, beautiful, educated and or non educated. And when I describe fairly I mean give each one their rights as people. Respect children same as you would have respect for dults. Fair for me is for example not happy with your non educated wife or husband instead of cheating let them go with proper methods. Another example not happy with a disabled worker instead of firing give them time and final pay lump sum. Giving everyone their fair share in a country is what's fair. Without breaking anyone back. Because living in a first world country with a third world treatment does not make sense. I am volunteering in an NGO and I am educating students to think critically about everything. We do it through the diplomatic simulation of the United Nation committees, students from highschool (mostly) are delegates of the state of their choice during the simulation and they have to negotiate the best results for their country. I know there is a plenty of these UN simulations worldwide but ours is unique that we do not focus just on the simulation itself, but we have five preparation meetings with the students where they are attending debates of famous people of our country and we are teaching them how to speak publicly and how to avoid stress while addressing a big crowd. We are based in Prague but we started to go to another Czech regions, where we focus on people from 8th and 9th grade of school (14\u201316 years old). I think that giving opportunities to these youngsters in remote areas is a way to improve life in our country as a whole, because we may be the first people who show them that they can do something in a different way instead of going with the flow. This is the way I do for improving my country.",

It can be a difficult task to break the wall with Carlos and Maldini. The midfield is gonna be a struggle with Zidane and Giggs squeezing out their energy. Ronaldinho is going to have some serious fun with the opposition defenders. If there is a forward someone like Thierry Henry in this veteran team, it over. Recently saw a friendly match where  56 years  old  Diego Mardadona  showing us that he is still got. I am sure that being 50 and play some good football is not gonna be an issue for these guys. Can a U-17 professional team beat an all-star legend team, ages 55 years old and up, that contains Maradona, Pele, etc.? Why A.C Milan can not build a new strong team like the Maldini's golden age? Why is there no Croatia national team in FIFA 15? What do the stars on soccer jerseys resemble? How can a soccer team add a star to their jersey? Which is the best football team and why? If we\u2019re really talking about Zidane, Roberto Carlos, Giggs and Maldini, then these guys are probably still too physically fit to be beaten by U-15 teams. A guy like Zidane could reasonably play faultlessly for Real Madrid, if you watch him during training. He\u2019s still ver much active and participates in the training drills. Ronaldinho has only been retired for a single year. Giggs has not been out for a long while, either. Maldini would probably be an insurmountable wall to any set of U-15 kids, no matter his age. Scholes should have retained his quality on the ball. I\u2019ve just touched a few of them, but the intensity of a match against an U-15 team will not be of an intensity too high for these ex-players. Absolutely no chance, they would get smashed. Having been lucky enough to play against an \u2018average\u2019 top flight player or two you realise how unbelievably good they are compared to non pros, the players you list are amongst the elite of the last 20 years. The only time the u-15s would touch the ball would be to kick off (repeatedly) and pick the ball out of the net at very regularly intervals. \u201cForm is temporary, but class is permanent\u201d This quote sums up pretty much the ability of these guys when it comes to football. Basically, the U-15 team is going to get SCHOOLED! Players like Maldini, Ronaldinho, Zidane, Maradona are simply too talented to be beaten by 14\u201315 years old boys. They have those instincts, that feel for the game that not many people have on this planet. So, give them like a 2-week training camp and they obliterate the U-15 team 29\u20130. If you gave them 30 goals head start, maybe. Seriously.",

Introverts need internal stimulus, extraverts need external stimulus. Neither is better or worse, thus neither need to change. If you\u2019re a shy or anxious introvert, you may want to resolve those responses in order to feel more comfortable in extraverted situations. If these affect your quality of life you can work on the responses, build resilience, via coaching. I\u2019ve always been an introvert (INTJ) and have loved it. I do public speaking and events\u2026 those can be quite draining for me. Would I rather be an extrovert? Not at all. I like how some quite time to myself recharges me and opens my mind. Each personality has its gifts. One should appreciate the gifts they\u2019ve been given and embrace who you are. For more about being an INTJ:  Getting to Know Me, the INTJ Personality Type How do I know if I am an introvert? What does it feel like to be an introvert? Is it okay to be introverted? Should people, in general, try to be more extroverted? How can I know if I am an introvert or extrovert? I feel like I'm too extroverted. How do I talk less? Even if there is a need, changing your basic character is not possible. You cannot just turn yourself into an extrovert overnight. Introversion is a very basic attribute of our personality and unless there are multiple situations over a period of time which shake you up and change you from inside out, it is not possible. As much need there is to start learning to write with your non-dominant hand. Neither side is better, each perspective has its own factors of assessment. While one can develop their non-dominant hand, it'll never be as better as your dominant hand. Even in the case of a StarCraft gamer or a pianist, who have tremendously developed both of their hands, the effect is one where the weaker hand complements and glides along with the dominant one, rather than competing with it. There is as much sense in truth as there is in untruth. What matters is how you perceive them. These are rather classifications and no one is 100% introvert/extrovert. Every one has mixed qualities of both personality types with either of the two being dominant. The need is not to change to something you are not and can never be, the need is to live in accordance with your nature, going in direction of what satisfies your soul, what makes sense for you even if whole world find it non sense.",

        "a": "Absolutely. In Asia, there seems to be a societal struggle between locals who speak fluent English, and those who don\u2019t. Those defined as \u201cEnglish-speakers\u201d may speak their local tongue(s) as well, but are more comfortable having a conversation in English in almost any setting. The rest speak a different local or family tongue fluently, and while some speak English well, many do not. I am a Malaysian citizen of Chinese ethnicity, and throughout my time in Malaysia I\u2019ve been pressured to define which of these two groups I belong to: A \u201cmango\u201d, or Chinese person who speaks Chinese and embraces Chinese culture, so named because mangoes are \u201cyellow on the outside as well as on the inside\u201d, or A \u201cbanana\u201d, or Chinese person who speaks English and tends to be more westernised, so named because bananas are \u201cyellow on the outside, but white inside\u201d. There are similar comparisons for Asians of other ethnicities and cultures, and because it tends to be both a product of education and upbringing, speaking perfect vs. broken English is still perceived as a strong class definer. I suppose this is the case even in societies where English is the only dominant tongue, e.g. whether you speak \u201cproper\u201d or \u201ccolloquial\u201d English. Bananas, for instance, tend to believe they benefit from speaking (supposedly) better English, as it is the international lingua franca. Not all bananas speak perfect English, but when a group of bananas meet a mango, it doesn\u2019t take long before they start to make fun of their English, or become impatient with the way the mango struggles to articulate. Mangoes, however, are proud to speak Chinese and be close to our culture, and in fact many of us  also  speak English, so we don\u2019t support the assumption that mangoes are inferior in any way. Still, bananas tend to lump all mangoes behind our most extreme cases \u2014 those who struggle to put together even the simplest English sentences \u2014 and discriminate against us as a whole as either less-educated or less connected to the international community (neither of which is necessarily true for either class), hence commonly believing mangoes are inferior candidates for work opportunities. In retaliation, mangoes sometimes remind bananas not to look down on their own race and their own language, advising them to reconnect with their roots and learn Chinese. Bananas don\u2019t take this well at all because they believe it\u2019s \u201cgood advice\u201d to tell mangoes to learn English, but \u201cbad advice\u201d for mangoes to tell bananas to learn Chinese. At the end of the day, mangoes suffer a lot of discrimination at the hands of bananas. While Mandarin Chinese is my mother tongue and I attended Chinese school for 11 years, I speak English at native proficiency and am a professional English writer and translator. I happen to speak both languages very fluently. You would think that being able to fit in with both groups would make it less likely for me to suffer from prejudice, but I feel the reverse is actually true. Bananas and other English-speaking mono-linguals tend to treat me with kid gloves. They are either convinced of my proficiency in English and believe my Chinese must be terrible, or convinced that my English can\u2019t be all that great. I\u2019ve had an English speaker dismiss my multi-lingualism as \u201cimpossible\u201d and demand to know if I can \u201cspell difficult words without help\u201d. I\u2019ve had bananas corner me with words they\u2019d just looked up in the dictionary and demand the verbatim definition, on the spot. I\u2019ve had people tell me \u201cimagine how much better your English would be if you didn\u2019t learn Chinese.\u201d I\u2019ve had banana friends who liked me just fine up till the point they realize I\u2019m a Chinese speaker suddenly become ill-tempered with me, accusing me of \u201cpretending\u201d to be something I\u2019m not. Often when I\u2019m seen with a book, or writing notes, in any language, it is taken very politically by my peers. Without knowing about my Chinese proficiency, bananas have heaped praise on my writing skills, even recommending me for jobs. As soon as they realize I\u2019m a Chinese speaker, they are full of doubt and spend a lot of time trying to find fault with my English \u2014 both written and spoken. I once had a supervisor (who was decidedly mono-lingual) say things like \u201cI\u2019ve never met a stronger writer at your age\u201d at the beginning of my tenure, then after the revelation of my Chinese background, protested when clients and superiors evaluated my work with high marks. \u201cIf you call her English GOOD then you have very low standards!\u201d My brother, a passionate English teacher and gifted writer, is often criticised by mono-lingual colleagues for being able to speak Chinese, which apparently makes him \u201cnot a REAL English speaker\u201d. And how do mangoes react to my English? Some admire it, because most mangoes  want  to speak English and put in genuine effort to learn it. But many have received so much disrespect and snobbery from bananas that, should they choose to dismiss me as an English-speaking banana (who just so happens to also speak Chinese), I instantly lose their trust. I\u2019ve also met some who would suddenly say \u201cI knew it, I knew there was something western about you\u201d and proceed to ask if I have \u201cwestern\u201d blood (nope) or was raised overseas (also nope). This is why I subscribe to the theory that even if we were all born of the same race, colouring and there was no concept of gender, humans would  still  find some way to discriminate each other for whatever differences we can find. Have you ever been mistaken to be a different race? Have you been a victim of a smear campaign? What is it like to be kidnapped? Have you ever hated your own race? Would you ever date someone outside of your own race? Yes. It has been related to my age, it continues to happen on occasion   although I am now  over fifty . There are people who have a real problem with judging someone on their knowledge and skills when they look (or are) younger than is typical for a situation. I was given all sorts of grief by the male owner of an amusement park where I worked for three years beginning the summer after eleventh grade. I suspect there was also possibly a bit of a racial component in that situation, but the age issue was blatant and loudly voiced. I was more responsible than the person he had promoted above me to run the department stating that she was older and therefore more mature and reliable. Ha. She quit with no notice just as we geared up for our busy season in the summer. Why? She decided to take her horses on tour. I was only eighteen, and suddenly I was running an entire department with no help. I had to fight to get a pay raise and the title of department head. I had to hire and train all employees (72 in my department at full staff levels in addition to me) while working seven days per week once we went to full summer hours. I worked 16 hours per day until I could promote some people to supervisory positions. I was juggling crazy schedules and special considerations for younger teens and their work hours, and the male owner still gave me pure hell questioning my judgment and calling me to the office for browbeatings for no reason. I was directed to never tell anyone my age because he had instituted some random rules requiring people be age 21 or older to operate certain rides, but I was only eighteen. Finally, on one particularly nasty day his wife (co-owner) took him to task and questioned his illogical behavior in front of me in the midst of one of his irrational rants. It was too little too late from my perspective. I was sick of the abusive behavior after two previous seasons of nonsense leading up to this moment, so mid-shift change on a busy Saturday, I removed my radio and keys and cut off his flow of  crazy  by saying, \u201cI quit.\u201d I didn't have time to arrive at home before the female co-owner had begun calling my family home to beg me to return. I did return her frantic call, but I informed her that I would come in the  next  day to accept her husband's apology first and then to discuss the terms under which I  might  return which would definitely need to include a significant pay raise. Under  no  circumstances would I return that day, so her husband could  enjoy  using his superior age and sort out the rides department (without which they had no business). Upon returnung, I was congratulated by supervisors from other departments on standing up to the bully, and informed of the chaos when that insued when he had to sort out everything after my exit. I have had multiple other issues related to  looking  younger than my actual age since becoming an attorney more than 20 years ago. After taking the bench, I have had minor issues related to it that don't amount to actual discrimination because the people with the age-related biases have not been in a position of power over me, but blatant condescension and  attempts  to bully still occur on occasion. It can be amusing because on a few occasions the person who clearly thinks that I am younger is in fact younger than me and   merely  looking  older in comparison. Yes, anti-Semitism at various times in my life. Yes. In 2014 my severe mental health issues related to my PTSD and other problems started impacting me to the point where I could no longer function professionally. I had always kept my mental health strictly separate from my work and took great pride in the fact that I was able to act competently and professionally regardless of how depressed I was. I didn\u2019t  always  succeed, especially from coworkers that knew me well, but from job performance standpoint, I always did. When I realized I couldn\u2019t do that, I took a leave of absence, using the FMLA and got professional help to deal with my mental health issues. Being a small company where I knew the owner fairly well, he gave me a call to check in on me. Telling me not to worry about my job and just take care of myself, he was very nice and I told him more about what was going on than was required and that I, in retrospect, should have. When I returned a few weeks later, things soon got back to normal. Then a few months later I had a meeting with him. I had been being groomed for a position moving from the consumer retail division to the corporate services division for some time, but it kept being delayed. The position was better in every way, with better pay, more opportunity for advancement and training, and I had pretty much gone as far as I could in my current position, so I was looking forward to the move, even if it kept being delayed. When I met with my boss, he told me that, because of my mental health issues, he was no longer going to give me that position. I was shocked. I had never thought he would use what I told him against me and what\u2019s more, I had never once allowed my mental health problems to impact my work and I removed myself when I thought they might start to. He told me he simply wasn\u2019t comfortable with someone with PTSD who had recently been hospitalized for it working closely with professional clientele. Needless to say, I did not take that lying down. I spoke to our HR rep who was pretty appalled that he would actually say something like that. I spoke to a lawyer and we ended up working it out legally. We parted ways fairly amicably a few weeks later. Prejudice against people with mental illness exists for sure, whether justified or not. It\u2019s made me more hesitant to bring it up in my professional life, even among those I consider \u201cfriends\u201d at work. There is still a massive stigma around mental illness that prevents people from getting the help they need for it and as a result, it remains an ongoing and untreated problem for many people. Sure. I\u2019ve been pre-judged because of my height, my hair (when I had a ponytail), my school (when I was a student), my program of study (when I was a student), my mode of dress, my age, my mother tongue (English-speaking people are sometimes seen as a problem in Quebec), my accent in English (in the UK), even my trousers and my shoes. Anything is fair game for someone to prejudge you. I was also a victim of anti-gay bias, though the person was mistaken, as I\u2019m not gay at all. In France I was almost a victim of an anti-French beating by some disgruntled Arab teenagers, until the perpetrators discovered that I was Canadian. It\u2019s funny that in some cases some of those things (like my height, or my mother tongue) would get me some extra consideration in some cases but discrimination in others. Don\u2019t get me wrong; none of this was traumatizing (except maybe the narrowly-avoided beating, and having a policewoman point her gun at me). There are assholes everywhere.",

        "a": "For aromaticity delocalisation of \u03c0 e- is necessary. The trick here is that in ring structures resonance occurs only if there is an alternate \u03c0-sigma-\u03c0-sigma bond and so on . In this case the -ve charge i .e lone pair of e- can be treated as a \u03c0 bond. Are the compounds mentioned below AROMATIC in nature? Although they have odd no. of delocalizable electron pairs but they may not be planar. How many lone pairs of electrons are around the sulfur atom in a SH- ion? Would we count a single electron in a lone pair? How could we determine the direction of a lone pair in an atom? Can I make O3 by adding 1 oxygen atom to an oxygen molecule? What sp hybridizations do nitrogen and oxygen have in NO and NO2? How are the atomic orbitals overlapped in these molecules? Pyridine:  you can see that in this example there is conjugation between pi bonds. But we have an another way of conjugation that is the lone pair of N atom participate in resonance. But here is problem because pi bond-pi bond conjugation is much more stronger than pi bond-lone pair.  God knows this.  So the god not allowed the lone pair to take part in pi-conjugated system. Pyrrole:  This is an obvious example. This lone pair doesn't have any other choice. It is necessary to this lone pair to take part in conjugation. Furane:  Both of the lone pairs want to delocalized, but only one of them is allowed to do this and second lone pair would sacrifice. So you can conclude that if there is more than one lone pair are available one one atom then only one can take part in conjugation. Hope it helps. You can upvote or downvote. But you can't ignore this. Aromaticity can be achieved only if three rules are followed: There should be complete delocalization of electrons. The planarity should be maintained. It should follow \u20184n+2 delocalized electrons' rule. Eg: Benzene has 6 delocalized electrons . Now the cases:- Pyridine: The lone pair delocalization here will violate 4n+2 rule(8 electrons will get delocalized which is antiaromatic condition). Pyrolle: The lone pair participation will help in achieving 6 electrons delocalization.(Aromatic condition). Furan: Only one lone pair participation brings about the aromatic condition. Hence only one lone pair participates. The main requirement is that the lone pairs should be in the same plane. So as much as the lone pairs are in the same plane more will be the aromaticity.",

        "a": "Thanks for the A2A  Naman Chakraborty  ! Disclaimer : \u201cThis question obviously is about an alternate reality or a fantasy universe where 3 Indian states are suddenly a part of Pakistan. This is not about war, military conquest etc. No one is implying that these states can be conquered by Pakistan. Just take this answer as a piece of fiction and don\u2019t get all militaristic and defensive over it. Please don\u2019t fill the comments section with \u201cOver my dead body will you take Kerala!!!1 No one is taking it, its a fantasy question with a fictional answer-_-\u201d Ok so, i can pick any 3 and reshape the history and nature of Pakistan as well, alongside these 3 states? I have unlimited power in that? Just to clear up a few things: This is a post 1971 Pakistan so either Bangladesh is a separate state or its still a part of India in this reality. Whatever it is, it isn\u2019t a part of Pakistan. In this reality, partition doesn\u2019t happen on basis of religion since my 3 picks are Hindu Majority states so some other unspecified reason caused this country to arise. I don\u2019t know the reason\u2026.maybe these countries wanted to be Communist rather than Capitalist so they separated to form a united Socialist state? Feel free to come up with any reason. Well then here goes: Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Goa Really well developed states, the lowest crime rates, no violent separatists movements for the most part at the moment and minimal communalism. Roughly speaking the map of this hypothetical country would look like this: First off, I\u2019d also consider maybe changing the name from Pakistan to something more neutral and friendly that unites all of the people. It should be a name that combines both Islamic and Hindu history and symbolises something that is cherished by people of both countries, regardless of their religion (and No, We are not naming the country Sunny Leone). My boring, non-poetic ass can only think of  South Asian Socialist Republics (SSR)  right now because i\u2019m a Left Leaning Socialist and i just went with my gut instinct on this. Yea boiiiiii I\u2019d adopt a constitution that strongly reflects Sheikh Mujib\u2019s Six Points in their entirety but with the wording changed to reflect the new Geography of SSR: Six point movement - Wikipedia The Constitution should provide for a Federation in its true sense based on the  Lahore Resolution , and the parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a Legislature directly elected on the basis of universal adult franchise. [1] The federal government should deal with only two subjects: Defence and Foreign Affairs, and all other residual subjects should be vested in the federating states. [1] Two separate, but freely convertible currencies for two wings should be introduced; or if this is not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Wings. Furthermore, a separate Banking Reserve should be established and separate fiscal and monetary policy be adopted for East Wing. [1] The power of taxation and revenue collection should be vested in the federating units and the federal centre would have no such power. The federation would be entitled to a share in the state taxes to meet its expenditures. [1] There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries. [1] Eastern Wing of SSR should have a separate military or paramilitary force, and Navy headquarters should be in  Goa . [1] The country\u2019s constitution would represent a strongly Federalist nature with localised governments for every ethnicity so that all cultures, languages and identities are respected. Federalist constitutions have shown a strong tendency to unite different cultures, religions and ethnic groups under one nation which is why the current Syrian Peace talks are also featuring a Federalist constitution to end the war: Quora User's answer to What are the war aims of the SDF (YPG)? Now in this new state, nearly 1/3rd of the population resides in the Eastern Wing of Goa, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. And they are predominantly Hindu while the Western Wing is Muslim. Because obviously, this new country isn\u2019t founded on the basis of religion right? I mean how can it formed on the basis of religion when its composed of 4 Muslim majority territories and 3 Hindu Majority States. (100 Million Hindus in Eastern SSR Wing and 200 million in Western SSR Wing). So i\u2019d make sure there are no provisions about this new country being an Islamic republic. I\u2019d ensure there are no restrictions on Non-Muslims not being able to hold public office. And i\u2019d ensure that the new state is purely secular. To ensure that minority groups are not trod over, i\u2019d make it a constitutional provision that the President Post and Speaker National Assembly post can only be held by a minority. This might be a symbolic gesture but it would mean a lot, would send a message that the SSR stands for tolerance and equality and all citizens are equal regardless of faith, ethnicity, gender and what not. I have to wonder if the Hindus can be considered a minority if they hold 1/3rd of the population. Technically speaking the slot for President and National Assembly should be reserved for a Sikh or a Christian who would be a true minority. But that\u2019s a separate issue. #Edit: I realize i forgot the capital city. Islamabad cant be the capital city anymore since it\u2019s so far from the Eastern Wing. I\u2019m gonna go with  either Goa or Karachi  as the Capital as they are both Coastal cities and relatively in the center of the state. Regarding the question on national languages : I think i would keep something neutral like English as the official language for use in official documents and government offices. Besides that, each state would be free to use their local language in their state level business and schools etc.  That way, no local language would be the official language and English would be the common language for all but all states would be free to use their local languages in their government and local affairs. This option presents less hassle and makes more sense in Federalist constitutional structure. An alternative would be use English, Urdu and Hindi at national level as Urdu and Hindi are relatively similar when spoke except for the written script. And ofcourse, local languages at state level. I would also probably partition Punjab in Northern Punjab staying as Punjab and southern part being made Seraikistan (Souther Center Punjab). This is becaude Punjab is huge in size and population and a smaller administrative unit is called for so the state structure does not have too much abnormalities. Conclusion I\u2019m guessing some people might wonder why i didn\u2019t just pick the states with the strongest Maoist insurgency if i wanted such a Leftist state. Well probably because i\u2019m not entirely on board with Maoism. And i understand that some regulated form of capitalism is needed to prevent economic collapse. I lean more towards Nordic forms of Socialist implementation where capitalism is heavily regulated and taxed rather than state owned economies. I picked these 3 states simply out of personal preference: They have good HDI They are very tolerant states and peaceful They have an amazingly rich culture The states would be a great influence over the Western wing of the SSR and provide a strong multicultural, tolerant influence. The division of the military among the two wings would also ensure that no coups are possible since the country is so spread out, decentralised and each wing has its own military formations under the Six Points constitution of Sheikh Mujib which is Federalist in nature. I would ensure that the officer corp is drawn from each and every state ranging from Baluchistan all the way to Tamil Nadu so it is a diverse group and the military is truly a national army and not dominated by one ethnic group only. And the Secular Federation would ensure that power is decentralised, religion is separate from the state, minorities are respected and each state has its own local powers to ensure that each ethnic group can forge policies to their liking and are only united on topics of Defence and Foreign affairs. I imagine the country would progress through history similar to China with initially strong Communist roots but slowly becoming more along the lines of Nordic states with Leftist governments regulating capitalism to pursue socialist policies. Relations with India would be better because no Kashmir issue (nation isn\u2019t founded on religion remember?) but i feel like we might still get into rocky waters because the SSR might still support Leftist Maoist insurgents in India due to the common Leftist nature of both groups and their ideologies. If Indians could add two Pakistani provinces to India, which ones would they choose, and why? Why are Pakistani flags still\u00a0 waved in Kashmir? Is it because some Kashmiri people still think themselves as 'Forced' Indians and assume that... Indians: If you can choose one person to represent your state, who would it be? Are the British people biased towards Indians when it comes to choosing between a Pakistani and an Indian? How does it feel to be an Indian in Pakistan? Vice versa, how does a Pakistani feel being in India? Jammu & Kashmir: Because of the pro Pakistan sentiment there in \u201csome\u201d areas. Pakistan would not have to worry about its water being cut off anymore. No more territotial disputes. No more wars. The brother countries would finally become brotherly. Its B-E-A-U-tiful. Pakistani Kashmiris would rejoice too. Because it annoys me when Indians say,  \u201cwe have reached Mars, Pakistan still can\u2019t get to Kashmir.\u201d  :) Punjab: Its people are the same as those in our Punjab. The Sikhs would be a fine addition to our army. Personally, although I\u2019m ethnically Pashtun, my family lived in Gurdaspur pre-partition, so I would love to go there. (Btw, this Pakistani/ Punjabi/Pastun/Muhajir has a real identity crisis.) ;) Maharashtra: So Indians would stop annoying me by saying,  \u201cGDP of Maharashtra is bigger than GDP of Pakistan.\u201d  :) Cheers! Edit: It's a joke guys. Not a di*k, don't take it so hard. \u2018If Pakistanis could add three Indian states into Pakistan, which ones would they choose? I ain't a Pakistani but perhaps I'll get you an accurate answer to which states would Pakistani Government choose (do you really think people's opinion will be counted? ). Okay so here we go : Maharashtra With an area of 307,713 km sq. it is the third largest Indian state. Comprising of India's biggest city Mumbai it will be a major checkpoint for Pakistan inside Indian territory. Madhya Pradesh Mostly for more area and gaining influence and border with more Indian states Madhya Pradesh would be a wise choice. West Bengal West Bengal,no it\u2019s not about Kolkata it will be the most important strategic post for Pakistan or I must say  China . Gaining control over Bengal will spread Pakistani influence in Bangladesh which will turn the already growing spark of radicalization into wild fire. And most important, the Chicken Neck once broken, only God knows what will save Eastern India from China. Many people will now probably say,  Why not Kashmir? -It\u2019s straight and clear, Kashmir for Pakistan is just like half bread is better than no bread. It'll be just like wishing water from Djin out of three wishes in a desert. There will still be chances of snatching Kashmir from India later on but will there be any chances of taking any of the three mentioned states? If Pakistan ever gets hands on any of our states, it won \u2019 t burdern itself with the pain of managing and governing them , they \u2019 ll take Andaman & Nicobar   Islands Puducherry Lakshwadeep Puducherry  is unique, its is a state (or Union Territory) made up of 4 unconnected districts. See what  Pakistan  gets by just  taking Puduchhery? Why would Pakistan these places, well because they would serve as military locations. Pakistan wont be the one setging up the bases, it would the triad of  China, Russia & US. Would\u2019nt the US love a base close to Russia? Would\u2019nt China Love to dominate the Indian Ocean? Would\u2019nt Russia try stopping them? Pakistan could also sell the islands to smaller powers, as they are a collection of landmasses. So Pakistan takes 3 states, gets 6 places (maybe more) to trade off, come out of it, looking all good, making strong diplomatic relations with everyone, and becoming  rich  one way or the another. Let the bidding begin! If Pakistan gets such an opportunity  at present  and if they are wise enough to chose only three Indian states to be added to their country, they would definitely chose: - Maharashtra Kerala Tamil Nadu I know most of them would not have expected these three states but if they are interested in preventing the rise of India as a superpower or keeping India\u2019s rising global potential in check, these 3 would be their ideal pick. Here you go why. Among the states in India,  Maharashtra  has the largest economy. The GDP of Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra itself is more than the GDP of Pakistan. The GDP of Maharashtra is itself 4 times that of the GDP of Pakistan. So, acquiring the state of Maharashtra would be a huge bonus for Pakistan and a loss for India as approx. 14% of the Indian economy is contributed by Maharashtra. From the above two images, it is quite clear that occupying the states of  Kerala  and  Tamil Nadu  would be a huge strategic advantage for Pakistan in controlling the Indian Ocean which is an important global trade route. Forget others advantages from these two states for Pakistan, the strategic control of the  Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal  and mainly the  Arabian Sea  itself can trouble India a lot. The cities of Kochi which is important for the Indian navy and an important port, Coimbatore which has an Air Force Base and Chennai which is an important port are located in these two states. The oil trade route in the map is shown in light blue. Acquiring these states would itself boost the economy of Pakistan and would make Pakistan a key controller of a major trade route in the world. Not to forget that Pakistan can also get closer to important Indian cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata.",

        "a": "I am not sure how outsiders, even Englanders view the political scene in Scotland at present, although cousins in Austria think the Brits are insane over Brexit. We currently have a situation where the Labour Party in Scotland, (there is no \u201cScottish Labour Party\u201d, currently running and registered in Scotland), objects to Trident, whereas the branch leader is in favour, yet down south, opposite is true. Down south, Labour are supposedly diametrically opposed to the Tories, but in Scotland, they espouse similar policies, (although SLAB can\u2019t actually make their own policies), to the point where they committed electoral suicide by fronting a Tory backed campaign against independence, in spite of the opinions of a significant number of their members. Since then, they have repeatedly allied themselves with the Tories at both the national level, where they won\u2019 t vote against them, or locally, where in some cases, they have tabled amendments to SNP motions, then voted AGAINST their own amendments and sided with the Tories, to thwart the SNP group. (This was in Stirling) Over the past couple of years, SLAB have seen their support plummet, in what was formerly their strongest territories, to the point where they are sometimes polling half that of the Tories. We now have the spectacle of their sole MP actually advising Labour voters to vote Tory, in order to thwart the SNP, with whom they are much more closely aligned, ideologically. As has been seen at the most recent council elections, SNP managed to become the largest party in half of the councils overall. Problem is that Labour refuse to reliquish power for the sake of democracy, and have actually allied themselves with the Tories in places like Aberdeen. Now, they have entered into a coalition with the Tories, to crowd out the SNP, who were much more popular. Some of the big Labour councils have a long history of cronyism, and corruption, such as exemplified in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. The Glaswegian Labour group are effectively refusing to vacate their offices now. This could backfire tremendously against Labour at the next general election in a couple of weeks, as it appears to demonstrate that they don\u2019t care about democracy, and what the people actually want. Even Krazier Dugsbawz, who never appears to tire of making a fool of herself in public, to the point that she has repeatedly been corrected for blaming the SNP for things Labour actually did, or even being dug up by presenters who observed that she mentions the SNP and independence NO MATTER WHAT question she is asked, while banging on about them both obsessing about it and playing mention of it down. (Even her own father has corrected her on Twitter\u2026lol) I would like to be able to say that even she would realise that you can\u2019t let councillors act like that and still retain an ounce of credibility. It should be noted that although they are suspended from the party, they are refusing to stand down from their posts, in spite of the fact that many people voted for them on the basis that they were Labour members. For each MP voting against Corbyn, 1000 Labour members voted for him. Should those MPs go? Is there an equivalent US political party to the UK's Labour Party? If so, what is it? Would Kezia Dugdale make a good leader of the National Labour Party? Scotland has voted twice now against independence 1) remain in the UK. 2) remain in the EU. Why does SNP believe there is a mandate to go inde... How do I vote for the Labour leader? It is the symptom of a party without principles or policies except for its own selfish party interests, personal careers and unwarranted sense of entitlement, and blame the SNP for disrupting that. It has no policies except \u201cVote Labour\u201d. While in England there has been a bit of a wave of activity among those attracted by Corbynismo (powerless, though, against an overwhelming majority of \u201cLabour\u201d MPs who should really be in the Tory Party), in Scotland there is only a continuing haemorrhage of Labour voters and members to the SNP, and all that is left is a tiny rump of Orangemen, municipal careerists with nowhere to go, and people who, quite simply, haven\u2019t been paying attention. They don\u2019t know where they are going, or what they are for. And unless they start getting used to the idea of Scottish independence and start supporting it before it actually happens, they will disappear as a historical irrelevance in the not too distant future. This is a bit ironic, given that their founder, Keir Hardie, was calling for Scottish \u201cHome Rule\u201d, i.e. independence within the Commonwealth, over a century ago. Depends if she means wholesale or across the board! The Tories have a better chance than Labour to beat the SNP in many seats.",

        "a": "Why do the British have so much control over Northern Ireland? Well, Northern Ireland is part of the UK, so you\u2019d expect the British to have more control over it than the French or the Nepalis. Northern Ireland is British, even if not everyone living there wants it that way (the majority do, mind you) or self-identifies that way (that bit\u2019s more complicated, there\u2019s British and Irish and Northern Irish in varying forms and varying degrees). As to why Northern Ireland is part of the UK, when the rest of Ireland left the UK and formed an independent country in the early 1920\u2019s, Northern Ireland remained in the UK. The details and history are complicated, but that\u2019s the long and the short of it. History of Northern Ireland - Wikipedia As to why Northern Ireland remains in the UK, that\u2019s because the majority of people living there either actively want it that way or are happy enough to leave it that way. Some folks there do want to leave the UK and join the Republic Of Ireland, but they\u2019re currently in the minority. Good Friday Agreement - Wikipedia Does the rest of the UK want Northern Ireland to stay in the union? Why is specifically Northern Ireland not a part of the Republic of Ireland? Are ethnic Irish proud to be British in Northern Ireland? What is the difference between England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Britain, Great Britain, United Kingdom, the British Islands, and the British... Do the Irish genuinely not like the Brits? Because a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish it that way, Possibly you could relate it to \"Why does the USA have so much control over Hawaii\". As long as a majority of the population of Northern wish to they will remain part of the UK. As others have pointed out, more knowledgably than I, there is a lot of history to account for the status quo. As an aside I have read many questions on Quora regarding Ireland, Northern Ireland, Island of Ireland, relationship between Scots and Irish, and of course the relationship between the English and the Irish; and it is clearly one of the least understood and most puzzling relationships for a lot of people who rather plaintively ask questions revealing how little they know of the relationship between the two countries. Because, in the settlement at the end of the Irish War of Independence - the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 - Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. Whatever specific local government is in place, it\u2019s currently British sovereign territory. If we take it that you mean the British outside the Island of Ireland, or perhaps more honestly, the English, the answer is that they don't. Northern Ireland had a local legislature long before Scotland or Wales. When the Army was first sent in, it was to protect the Catholics from discrimination by local institutions, controlled by people who were both Irish and, they insisted, citizens of the UK. Two things would cause huge rejoicing in the British establishment, especially the top Civil Servants: for the overwhelming majority in Northern Ireland to decide that the time had come to negotiate a single, secular government for the Island of Ireland; and then for the Argentinian government to make such a generous offer for self-government within Argentina that the people of the Falklands would decide that a transfer of sovereignty was a good idea.",

        "a": "Hello again Mark, Well I will tackle this in 2 states of wolverine as we know him : Comics A normal wolverine would not see any sort of major improvement than what he already has in my opinion for the following reasons: He was already a master strategist and has mastered almost every martial arts over the 200 years + of his existence He already had super human senses, speed and reflexes that outclassed almost any major hero. Daredevil himself has stated that wolverine had sense better than his own and that is a big review He had amazing regenerative and healing capabilities that is unparalleled. He healed from a nuclear blast, I doubt cap would survive that He already had beyond human strength due to the adamantium skeleton and his endurance(healing factor) allowing him to lift a couple tonnes in weight and fight for long periods of time at end Only possibility of improvement would be maybe his memory which in the movie showed CAP being able to remember each hydra location after just one glance at the map on the wall of Dr Zola\u2019s lab. Movie: He still had all the above characteristics though they obviously could not show it in the detail that the comics did for budget reasons and a possible ground in reality The serum would possibly have two effects It could have helped him recover due to his failing healing factor to a certain extent and probably make him live longer The healing factor treated the drug as a foreign substance and muted its effects. Wolverine doesn\u2019t get drunk or drugged because of his healing factor, though in the movie they showed he was getting so, which makes me believe that possibly the former point might occur. I hope this possibly helped out!! Why is Captain America old in Old Man Logan? In Logan (2017 film), Laura does not seem to get injured. Does she heal faster than Logan or is it just censorship for the film? If Wolverine was born as James Howlett why is he called Logan? How would you rank all the Captain America suits from the MCU? Are Thor (2011) and The Winter Soldier the two best MCU films? In the comics, it wouldn\u2019t be very nice. One of the things that \u201cVita Rays\u201d do to its subjects is make them grow to optimal height. And since Wolverine is only 5\u20323\u2033, he\u2019d end up growing about a foot, similar to how Rogers did. Now, the problem that we reach is the fact that Wolverine\u2019s bones are laced with Adamantium. And, if he were to start growing with that Adamantium still covering his body, his spine and all of his limbs might collapse. At best, this would immobilize him and put him in a state where his body perpetually tries to heal, to no avail. At worst, Wolverine\u2019s internal organs would eventually fail, and he\u2019d die. As far as the movies are concerned though? Wolverine is 6\u20322\u2033. So the serum probably would have given Howlett an extra boost of strength, without any of the bad side-effects. It might\u2019ve even reinvigorated his healing factor, so that the Adamantium poisoning was no longer effecting his body. And if that had happened\u2026 Well, we might\u2019ve gotten a far happier ending for the man who\u2019s the best at what he does. Its entirely possible that his body might reject the serum/treatment and revert back his native mutant state. I belive that his meant healing ability will attack the tr aent and purge him of the serum. Short of the permanent grafting of the adamantium metal to his bones, a serum based treatment coupled with some level or irradiated augmentation, could be something that his Mutant healing abilities will reject and purge from his body. For the Super Soldier serum to be of any use for a mutant like Wolverine, it just be designed to work n cto jtion with his native DNA so as to trick his system into establishing the enhancements a native attribute rather and an indiced byproduct of chemical and irradiated \u201cattack\u201d to his body. The only way I can see t work is if Wolverine!s native Mutant X Gene were temporarily suspended and the Super soldier serums introduced for a period of time so that his entire genetic makeup accepts new enhanced Super soldier DNA set. Reintroducing his mutant abilities after his new abilities have stabilized is the only way it could work Howlett is Jimmy's last name, but if he was given the super soldier serum, his body would've burned it up\u2026 while the serum is technically gene therapy, Wolverine's healing factor protects his DNA too. So the sim wouldn't have had any more effect than the serum he took in the movie. It wouldn't have lasted long. If he had taken it at the end of his life, he probably would have died from a heart attack or something. Cuz at the end, Logan was just an old ass man. In the comics, it actually would have been a serious downgrade. When he was writing  New X-Men , Grant Morrison retconned the Weapon X project so that it was part of an ongoing U.S. military project, Weapon Plus. It was originally developed as a eugenics program but, it began working on producing super soldiers during World War II. Captain America - Weapon I - was its first success. Wolverine - Weapon X - was part of the tenth generation of the project. Whatever Weapon Plus did to Steve Rogers would be less drastic than whatever it did to Logan.",

        "a": "Consider a cantilever beam as shown in figure, is subjected to external load  P . Now you imagine that the beam is to be cut at a section, you see that the applied force  P  tends to displace the right hand portion of the beam relative to the left hand portion, which is fixed in the wall. This tendency is resisted by internal forces between the parts of the beam. At cut portion a resistance force,Q (and also a bending moment, but as per this question not required) will induced. This resistance force is nothing but the  shear force. Pic source:  google How do I calculate shear force for an inclined beam? How is shear force originated in a beam? What is the slope of a shear force diagram? How do you find the shearing force of a cutting machine? What will be the shear stress at the neutral axis of beam? Shear force  is the  force  in the  beam  acting perpendicular to its longitudinal (x) axis. For design purposes, the  beam's  ability to resist  shear force  is more important than its ability to resist an axial  force . Axial  force  is the  force  in the  beam  acting parallel to the longitudinal axis Take a thin flexible ruler in your hands, holding it at each end, and start to bend it. The bending is a result of the moment you've induced into the ruler, which is greatest right in the middle of the ruler. Bend the ruler some more and you'll feel how it might snap in the middle. You'll also start to feel how the ruler could break right by your hand. That is shear force. Shear force is calculated for the design of (among other things) bolted or welded connections between beams and columns. In addition to the \u201cY\u201d direction shear force there can be an additional shear force that runs along the beam when it is subjected to bending. Consider a deck of cards held firmly at each end and a (bending) moment applied. The cards do not remain aligned because of the shear force between them.",

Since he was a four-year college player, many scouts expected him to be NBA-ready. But after his first season, it\u2019s clear that he will need at least two years to develop into a professional-level player. Per 100 possessions in his first season, Dunn averaged: 11.1 points per game 7.2 assists per game 6.3 rebounds per game In comparison, Buddy Hield, another rookie that played four years in college, averaged these stats per 100 possessions: 22.7 points per game 3.1 assists per game 7.2 rebounds per game As you can see, Hield\u2019s stats are much better. But averages don\u2019t determine how good a player is. Let\u2019s look at some advanced analytic stats for both players this season. Player Efficiency Rating Dunn: 8.1 Hield: 11.8 Value Over Replacement Player Dunn: -0.1 Hield: -0.4 True Shooting Percentage Dunn: 43.2% Hield: 54.0% As you can see, Hield has the edge over Dunn in two of these categories, and is the more efficient player. While they both played four years of college ball, Kris Dunn is not nearly at an NBA level yet, but there\u2019s no telling what the future may hold for this young player. [Image from Google. Thanks for reading!] Why are there so many NBA draft busts? So far, who's been the biggest bust of the 2014 NBA Draft? Was Jim Jackson a total draft bust from the 1992 NBA draft? Who were the biggest busts in the NBA of all time? At age 29, can I still be drafted in NBA? Maybe , but it's too early to tell. Having been a 4-year college player hurts his \u201cpotential\u201d, but the point guard spot historically takes the longest to develop - with most young starters not cracking All-Star or All-NBA until 24\u201326, if ever. Even those who wreck shop early (Tyreke Evans, Michael Carter Williams) come back down to earth. Those who sustain their early promise (Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker) still take a few years to learn how to win. Dunn is 22.  I don't know if he'll be a star, but he's good enough athletically and defensively to be a pro for a long time. I also have a hard time attributing, \u201cbum\u201d to anyone who\u2019s overcome as much as he has and buys their parents a house. Lastly, he shouldn't be penalized for where he gets drafted or for being the best player available after Simmons, Ingram, and Brown; happiness is a function of expectation. I won't judge him this early. Minnesota is blooming with new and young guns with Zach Lavine, wiggings and KAT, so Kris Dunn doesn't get those many touches to be that effective coming off the bench. But he had surely shown the glimpses of whom he can be if develops into the next level. I think to develop a Rookie, the management plays a vital role. Coach Thibs is one of those coaches who usually gets the best of your players. Remember the Bulls, with young Derrick Rose winning the MVP! So I would give him a shot and not call him a bust unless he gets injured or gets little playing time to be effective.",

To give your hair an all-over, shower-fresh feel, you must divide and conquer by parting the hair into sections. The key is to let your pointer finger be your guide by aligning it with your ear, then separating your hair into the back and front parts. Take 1-2 inch sections parallel to your natural part and spray your roots. Continue towards the back, taking horizontal sections, then flipping them to the other side of your head, and stacking them on one another For added volume and a more fluid set, flip your hair upside down, then use your fingers to blend the powder, shake out your roots, and allow the dry shampoo to move towards your ends.

Lots of plants make similar aroma molecules, known as terpenes and terpenoid compounds, including lemons (which make limonene), lavender (linalool) and conifers (pinene) -- but none of them are closely related to cannabis or hops. Terpenes are a class of organic compounds synthesized by cells. They all start with a particular base molecule, called isoprene. I won't go into terpene biosynthesis here, but it's important to remember that all terpenes are built up using one or more copies of isoprene. A few of the primary aroma terpenes in hops are myrcene, beta-pinene and alpha-humulene--these and similar aromatic compounds are also what give cannabis plants their characteristic smell. Further, the major bitter compound in hops, the so-called alpha acids, aka humulone, is a terpenoid (derived from terpenes).

Like the rest of Europeans, we are a mix of: 1) black skinned hunter-gatherers, who were the first to arrive 2) A wave of farmers from the middle east that brought their crops and livestock, starting around 10k years ago. 3) Bronze age horse riders from the steppes (present day Russia and Ukraine). They were males that left their women at home and brought metallurgic knowledge, chariots and horses. They came around 4,5k years ago, and must have enjoyed a tremendous success amoung the local ladies, as their contribution to our DNA is the highest of the three groups. So what happened to celts and iberians, who blended and gave way to celtiberians? The celts correspond approximately with the descendants of the third group. Their concentration is higher in the northern regions of Spain. The iberians were a mix of the first two groups, that had been living and breeding together for millenia before the arrival of the celts. If you add smaller amounts of blood from Phoenicians, Romans, Visigoths, Arabs and a few others, you will get the core composition of a present day spaniard. Is the white race going to go extinct? Are the majority of Filipinos multiracial? How many days should I spend in Ibiza Spain? Why are many Mozart operas set in Spain? How many people of the Costa del Sol can speak English (Spain)? I don\u2019t have much specific knowledge. As far as I am aware the DNA profile is pretty much the same mish mash of ethnicities you find anywhere else in Western Europe But Europeans don\u2019t much care.

        "a": "The advice I was given long ago is: \u201chave your fantasy, just let your husband get the benefit.\u201d Take that turned on feeling and whatever sexual fantasy and have a great time with your husband. I have had obsessions about other men during my marriage. I don't take them seriously. It's just an infatuation\u2014 usually to distract me from something else in my life that is going badly (career, health problems, stress, etc). Yes, I get obsessed for a while. Obsession is not good, but I don't let it wreck my marriage. My most recent obsession created a wonderful turning point in my marriage. I took all those turned on thoughts and fantasies and asked my husband to act out those fantasies with me. Very hot and lots of fun. It rejuvenated my marriage. I never told my husband about my obsession. I never did anything with that person. It all stayed in my head. My obsession gradually went away. I do recommend you stop seeing him. You don't want to indulge yourself anymore. Think about ending it to protect your children, or whatever motivates you. Love: I'm deeply in love, and I can't stop thinking about him all day. This drives me crazy. How can I stop thinking about him, knowing that h... Why can\u2019t I stop thinking about my married coworker? I can't stop thinking about my ex. I miss him and his family. He's moved on. I'm in so much pain, it's been months. How can I stop loving him?... This guy told me he had feelings for him, and I told him I didn't like him back. So why can't I stop thinking about him? I think I am obsessed with a guy. What can I do to stop these feelings? Accept that what you are feeling isn\u2019t \u201cwrong\u201d, but is only one side of the coin. That way you aren\u2019t trying to change your feelings, but are simply changing whatever you choose to do. I\u2019m not voicing whether going outside of the traditional marriage is acceptable or not, but that you have to consider the full story. Obviously if you have an open marriage your story would be much different than one who isn\u2019t in such. So, assuming that yours is not and this would be a betrayal to your husband, first, put yourself in his place. Would you be accepting of your husband having a fling with another woman? Even if he said that it was just physical and fun, but he loves you, would you feel that is fine? If that thought causes you discomfort, imagine the pain it would cause him and, if you have any, your children. If a moment of pleasure is higher priority than their pain, then that should be addressed first. It is easy to consider the great time and feelings that you may have with a fling, but don\u2019t stop there like some romance novel. Continue the story to where you end up in love with two people and have to choose between your family and this new person to spend life with. Consider what would happen if your family discovered the affair happened and how that affects them. Often when you stop imagining only the positive side, and truly acknowledge the just as possible negative side, you can see the full spectrum that reality brings and then make the best decision. I\u2019m a guy, so what I do may be totally different than what \u2018females\u2019 do. I um, masturbate and stuff. And I love, and feel love, and feel the regret of doing things that may hurt others. So I don\u2019t. But I can fantasize about sex and stuff, like who is going to know? So just maybe imagine what \u2018reality\u2019 would be like. Kind of \u2018messy\u2019 right? But in our imaginations we can do whatever we want, and then just clean it up with a thought, and then do it again with no one really getting hurt. But if is a real life change that suits you situation in a positive way for you, then this is a possibility too. Just the possibility can be enough for us sometimes too. We all need love, and if live seems to be lacking in anyway in our lives, then we tend to seek the love that is out there and available. We can also nourish the love that is already available in our lives. We do all have the freedom of choice. But we can all be \u2018wrong\u2019 at times too. But it is our ability to choose (good or bad, wrong or right,) and our good moments in life, that really ought to be cherished in life. Never regret a thing. Because for each of us, it is about us. It is about you. And me, etc. We are all really in the same boat as all this. Sure we may all vary widely in what we want or need to \u2018feel\u2019 in life, but the bottom line is when we gotta go, then we gotta go\u2026Sometimes.

That line of thinking combined with D\u2019Angelo Russell\u2019s cratered trade value - I don\u2019t think it is likely he CAN be moved - leads me to think that Magic might pull trigger on Lonzo, throw him out there on the court with DAR and Ingram, and let Walton figure it out / let the boys play. I\u2019m not a huge fan of DAR\u2019s game, but you don\u2019t draft a player #2 overall and give up on him when he is 21 - he\u2019s way too young and has too much upside. If they take Lonzo, play the season, figure out they don\u2019t fit together, AND Lonzo is a much better player? Then you trade him. Bottom line: They\u2019re going to be exposed defensively together and they\u2019re both better off playing off ball in two PG lineups, but they\u2019re both incredibly young and each possesses a tremendous amount of upside. DAR wouldn\u2019t net a ton of return value on the trade market and the Lakers still don\u2019t quite know what you\u2019ve got with him.  Keep him Will the Lakers draft Lonzo Ball? Will D'Angelo Russell or Brandon Ingram become superstars for the Lakers? What is the worst NBA draft class? Who is the best Laker of all time? What is the future of the Lakers? The Lakers will  NOT  trade D\u2019angelo Russell. The Lakers plan to use Lonzo ball as their primary point guard and slide D\u2019angelo Russell to the 2 as was evidenced by his many starts at shooting guard at the end of the regular season. They see russell more as an off ball threat and not someone that can run an offense. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to because the only that they are good no is because of him, so if the Lakers trade him I feel like they would be screwed even with Lonzo Ball.

How do we save Gibraltar from Spain? Why is it difficult for Turkey to join the EU? How can I get from Madrid to Gibraltar? If Gibraltar is part of the UK, there is no way it can remain as a EU member. After all, it is what the British have decided. A treaty could be signed to make things easy for Gibraltarians and also for some Spaniards living nearby Gibraltar. Spain, however, has nothing to do with this. It looks like the British try to blame Spaniards for their mistake given the fact that over 90% of Gibraltarians voted to remain in the EU. Also, neither Spaniards want Gibraltar nor Gibraltarians want to become Spanish citizens. In short, this is just British political propaganda to arise feelings of resentment and hatred against Spain. Period. The whole Gibraltar topic has being barely mentioned in Spanish newspapers and most people do not give a damn. As soon as the Brits decided to leave the European Union on June 23, 2016, Spain didn\u2019t lose any time reclaiming sovereignty over the rock of Gibraltar .

Spain doesn\u2019t need Gibraltar and it\u2019s beneficial for the local economy, but it\u2019s also a potential threat. At any point UK could use it for something against the interests of Spain.

ITS EFFECT AND HOW TO PREVENT YOUR DATA FROM THAT VIRUS RANSOMWARE Ranaswamkar, who called for ransom by locking down the computer, has reached \u2018Vanacrai\u2019 in more than 150 countries of the world. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India on Monday issued an alert to banks asking them to keep the software update of ATM, as RanSaware has attacked the payment system worldwide. According to reports, most of the ATMs in India are running on the older versions of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system and are extremely insecure for such cyber attacks. There are 2.2 million ATMs in the country and most of the older version Windows XP is being used. RBI has asked banks to follow the instructions of the Government Organization CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team). According to the reports, around 70% of ATMs in India are using outdated software. So it is easier to target them. Windows XP is most affected by RanSamware. This is the 70% ATM in India. However, after the attack, Microsoft has issued XP security patches. Ransomware The RanSware virus takes the ATM in the maintenance mode and forces the notes to be exhausted. The world\u2019s largest ATM maker, NCR Corp, had warned Indian banks about this dangerous virus a month ago. There are information on RanSware attack in some computers of the other institutes along with the police department in Maharashtra. Four computers of Panchayat office in Wayanad, Kerala and West Midnapore in West Bengal also have reports of this virus attack at 4 places of the state electricity distribution company\u2019s computers. The first version was not broken, now the threat of another attack According to European Union Police Europeol, more than 2.27 million computers have been locked. Experts have not been able to break the first version so far and now another attack is also expected. UK\u2019s security researcher \u2018Malware Tech\u2019 said, \u201cThe second attack can happen. Any other version can come, which we will not be able to stop.\u201d Malware Tech had previously helped reduce the speed of the attack. According to Europolli, even though 2 lakh computers worldwide are locked, but the number of people who have ransom is very small. RBI and NPCI alerts Indian Government has alerted the RBI, Stock Market and NPCI. In this regard, cyber security arm of the government has issued \u2018Doz and Doots\u2019 to these agencies and has instructed to take full measures to stop any incidents like data leaks. CERT-In has issued the most recent red alert. There is danger of attacks on institutes related to infrastructure, including defense, power, telecom, airport, banking, stock market, school. Once a virus is attacked on one computer, the entire local area network will be in its possession. READ ALSO: USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO PAY A HEAVY PRICE TO SYRIA: US According to official sources, \u201cThe government has arranged to deal with the situation, CERT-In has asked people not to ransom, even though no major case of cyber attack has come to this day.\u201d Do the first thing by reaching the office Check that the patch of anti virus and Windows updates in the computer. If the suspicious links appear in the e-mail, do not click. Do not open or download such attachments. Use only by scanning the pan drive. If the virus has been attacked then do it If the virus starts running, first remove the network cable, so that the second computer in the office is not infected. Shut down the computer immediately. Ransomware solution STAY ALERT \u2026 Do not open suspicious or phishing emails Do not open e-mails from strangers. Delete junk e-mail without opening it. Open Compass or MS Word file with caution. Do not open suspicious files. Avoid such websites as well. Keep backing up If regular data is backed up, then the ransomware can recover the affected files too. Do not pay ransom even when locked Do not ransack the hacker even if the computer is locked. There is no guarantee that the sender of the ransomware will send you to finish the encryption. Yes, criminals will definitely understand that you are easy prey. They can also try to recover from you in the future. Do not hide file name extensions Ransomware viruses often change the file extension. We do not see this in our system. Keep file name extension options visible and can easily identify suspicious files. The effect of cyber attack In the attack on April 12, computers of hundreds of countries stopped working. This is a special kind of ransomware cyber attack, which has demanded ransom in bittoine. The health services of many countries, including the UK, were severely overwhelmed due to this. According to the BBC\u2019s report, this attack was carried out on important organizations around the world. According to the Europol report, the impact of the cyber attack has reached more than 150 countries and has affected over 2 million computers. These countries are also affected by the attack, most affected Russia According to the report, the other cyber attacks in other countries include Britain, America, China, Russia, Spain, Italy, Vietnam and many other countries. In all these countries, ransomware attacked together. According to news agencies, most of Russia\u2019s computers have come in the grip of this attack. Russia\u2019s Home Ministry has also confirmed this attack. In addition to the UK, special companies working in Spain have been hit by this cyber attack. Source :  What is Ransomware ? Its Effect and How to prevent Your Data from that virus What is Spora Ransomware? Can Cerber ransomware be defeated? What is Petya Ransomware? How does one deal with cyber ransomware? Has anyone in Quora been a victim of ransomware attacks? Hoax, truth, lie and disaster come at the same time. And this is what happened on 12th May, Friday. When 230,000 computers were on the roller coaster around 150 countries with the software demanding ransom payments for the exchange of your own data in the cryptocurrency bitcoin in 28 languages. WannaCry is far and away the most severe malware attack so far in 2017, and the spread of this troubling ransomware is far from over. And it is not over yet, it is spreading on vast pace. So let\u2019s dig a small check on this sweet little virus. What is WannaCry Ransomware Virus? It is a computer program which is designed to take hostage of your computer which is targeting the Microsoft Operating System. It holds the infected computer hostage and demands that the victim pay a ransom in order to regain access to the files on his or her computer. How this Virus works? Before we start working on this virus we need to understand what is EternalBlue and DoublePulsar. EternalBlue:  It is a software developed(Believed to be) by US  National Security Agency . In simple words, it is a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic. It is known as  exploits . DoublePulsar:  It is also an exploit, but it backdoor exploit. What it does, it bypasses normal authentication in a computer system. Unfortunately it is also developed by  National Security Agency.  DoublePulsar is often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plain text in cryptographic systems. So our virus WannaCry uses both EternalBlue and DoublePulsar for hacking your device, which spread through network i.e. (Internet) which has not installed latest security updates. Those still running exposed older, unsupported operating systems were initially at particular risk, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, but Microsoft has now taken the unusual step of releasing updates for these. So, how exactly it works? \u201cFree\u201d , people are crazy about free things. Free Money, free service or anything free if you get it free. So it comes with an email attachment. Like invoice, shipment or any tracking document. It looks like so generic that users are compelled to click on those attachment. Let me show you, how those emails look like? These emails are just sample, you will get these kind of email. The moment you click on the attachment\u2026  Voillaaaaaaa. Hackers hit the jackpot. What exactly does WannaCry do? RansomWare like WannaCry works by encrypting most or even all of the files on a user\u2019s computer. Then, the software demands that a ransom be paid in order to have the files decrypted. In the case of WannaCry specifically, the software demands that the victim pays a ransom of $300 in bitcoins at the time of infection. If the user doesn\u2019t pay the ransom without three days, the amount doubles to $600. After seven days without payment, WannaCry will delete all of the encrypted files and all data will be lost. Type of files which are targeted by WannaCry Virus. According to Symantec almost all file types are targeted. These are the list which is targeted by WannaCry virus. .123, .3dm, .3ds, .3g2, .3gp, .602, .7z, .ARC, .PAQ, .accdb, .aes, .ai, .asc, .asf, .asm, .asp, .avi, .backup, .bak, .bat, .bmp, .brd, .bz2, .cgm, .class, .cmd, .cpp, .crt, .cs, .csr, .csv, .db, .dbf, .dch, .der, .dif, .dip, .djvu, .doc, .docb, .docm, .docx, .dot, .dotm, .dotx, .dwg, .edb, .eml, .fla, .flv, .frm, .gif, .gpg, .gz, .hwp, .ibd, .iso, .jar, .java, .jpeg, .jpg, .js, .jsp, .key, .lay, .lay6, .ldf, .m3u, .m4u, .max, .mdb, .mdf, .mid, .mkv, .mml, .mov, .mp3, .mp4, .mpeg, .mpg, .msg, .myd, .myi, .nef, .odb, .odg, .odp, .ods, .odt, .onetoc2, .ost, .otg, .otp, .ots, .ott, .p12, .pas, .pdf, .pem, .pfx, .php, .pl, .png, .pot, .potm, .potx, .ppam, .pps, .ppsm, .ppsx, .ppt, .pptm, .pptx, .ps1, .psd, .pst, .rar, .raw, .rb, .rtf, .sch, .sh, .sldm, .sldx, .slk, .sln, .snt, .sql, .sqlite3, .sqlitedb, .stc, .std, .sti, .stw, .suo, .svg, .swf, .sxc, .sxd, .sxi, .sxm, .sxw, .tar, .tbk, .tgz, .tif, .tiff, .txt, .uop, .uot, .vb, .vbs, .vcd, .vdi, .vmdk, .vmx, .vob, .vsd, .vsdx, .wav, .wb2, .wk1, .wks, .wma, .wmv, .xlc, .xlm, .xls, .xlsb, .xlsm, .xlsx, .xlt, .xltm, .xltx, .xlw, .zip As you can see, the ransomware covers nearly any important file type a user might have on his or her computer. It also installs a text file on the user\u2019s desktop with the following ransom note: Who is responsible for WannaCry Virus outbreak? Thanks to NSA(National Security Agency, US) for discovering the \u201cEternalBlue\u201d exploit that would later be used by the WannaCry trojan. Even Microsoft attacks US government over developing \u2018EternalBlue\u2019 exploit that led to hack. How can you protect your system from this Virus? Regardless of which operating system you run, you should install any and all available security updates immediately. Specifically, Windows users with machines that run Windows XP, Windows 8, or Windows Server 2003 should immediately install  security update  released on Friday by Microsoft. If your system is infected by WannaCry Virus, can you recover your data? Sadly No, You can\u2019t. There is no fix for WannaCry available at this time. Antivirus companies and cybersecurity experts are hard at work looking for ways to decrypt files on infected computers, but no means of third-party decryption are available right now. Hopefully affected users have backups of their data available, because the only other option right now is to follow the instructions offered in the software to pay the ransom. How to respond to WannaCry Virus attack manually? Disconnect your device from the internet to ensure there is no further infection or ex-filtrating of data as the ransomware will be unable to reach the command and control servers. Set BIOS clock back in case the ransomware has a time limit associated to it as with Wanna Cry. Hoax related to this virus: Once this virus got spread around the world, hoax was developed around it. A viral WhatsApp message claiming that a video called \u201cDance of the Hillary\u201d is a virus which formats their mobile phone is actually a hoax. The message was circulated widely and has even reached Malaysian users, but has been rubbished by the Reserve Bank of India, who said they were keeping a close watch on the situation involving the WannaCry ransomware attack. Key Points: Approx 250,000 computers are affected around the globe in 150 countries. And the Attackers have collected about $50,000 from the victims so far Accidentally this virus was halt after buying domain name. But It was just a temporary halt. It is the largest Cyber attack in the history according to experts. Microsoft Blasted the NSA for \u2018Stockpiling\u2019 Vulnerabilities & Says It\u2019s Like the Military Having \u2018Some of Its Tomahawk Missiles Stolen\u2019. Microsoft Has Released Updates to Its Older, Unsupported Operating Systems, Like XP & Windows 2003, Which Were the Most Vulnerable Ransomware is a type of malware (malicious software) that encrypts data on the victims computer and demands a ransom to release access to the data. 2016 has seen a rise of Ransomware from 1,000 to 4,000 attacks per day. Plenty of organizations, enterprises and individuals have become victims of ransomware attacks. Read more about ransomware here: http://beyondtheblocks.reduxio.c... This answer is pulled from  a post on the DigitalEndpoint Blog. What is ransomware?\u2026 Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts data on a person\u2019s computer, or a company\u2019s server so that it is rendered effectively useless. If you want to get your data backs, you have to pay a ransom which the hackers demand. Worse yet,  according to Intel,  this method of hacking is increasing at an alarming rate. Victims Of Ransomware Recently, the University of Calgary paid 20,000 Canadian dollars worth of bitcoins to ransomware hackers, which experts fear could encourage further hacks, as reported by  BBC Furthermore, as is the case with the University of Calgary, the decryption keys provided after the ransom was paid needed to be processed carefully in a time-consuming process which doesn\u2019t always lead to full recovery of all data breached. The Cause Of Ransomware The main cause of hacks is usually human error. Some employees may not know what suspicious emails look like and by simply following a fake link and entering personal details can give hackers immediate access to sensitive data and company servers. It\u2019s important to regularly update anti-virus software and application system software as well as inform employees about suspicious emails and links and how to spot them. However, there are further steps you can take to add another line of defense for your workplace. To learn about preventing ransomware, read the full post on the  DigitalEndpoint Blog.",

One of the main goal of the EU is to prevent both trade and conflict war among member states by providing economic stability and sharing of common market and technology for the benefit of member state. The AU (55 member countries) has its main goal providing political stability and cultural integrity. The AU has little powers over human right on member states for example a person in any EU country can drag the government to the EU court of justice and the ruling is binding on the government to act but in the case of the AU there has been little if not none resolution that has been ratified by any member states.

        "a": "It\u2019s true. During the Japanese occupation, several hundred thousand Korean men were forced into conscription to fight for Imperial Japan. The majority were forced to fight even though they didn\u2019t want to, otherwise their lives would be in danger so they had no choice. Many Koreans deserted and surrendered to the allies during the war because they didn\u2019t believe it was worth dying for Japan. Why do Koreans get mistaken for Japanese? Despite controlling the sea, why were the British not able to cut supplies to Rommel's army in North Africa during WWII? Why do so many young Koreans hate Japanese? Were Koreans drafted by Imperial Japanese Army during World War 2? Is it true that, for the most part, American World War Two combat soldiers were sent home right after the war and were not part of the occupat... Yes, true. Serving as a soldier was very popular in Korea as the region was still very poor and the pay was very good. The below are the numbers: I do not have numbers for 1944 and 1945. But conscription of Korean-Japanese was only conducted in the last four or five months before the end of the War. There were no main land Chinese soldiers or Indian soldiers in the Imperial Japanese Army, though there were 80,433 Taiwanese soldiers. Korea was annexed by Japan at the time while Taiwan was a colony. Thus, the Korea-born soldiers were actually Japanese soldiers. So, unlike the Western armies which had some natives from their colonies for their soldiers at the front line, there were many korea-born officers, with the highest ranking officer being lieutenant general, Hong Sa-ik. In fact, South Korea\u2019s former president, Park Chung-hee, the father of the previous president, Park Geun-hee, was an officer in the Japanese army. All the officers had to graduate from the Japanese military academy. After the War, 129 Korea-born officers/soldiers were convicted, of which 14 were sentenced to death. Korea-born soldiers were notorious for being very cruel. The following are some of the testimonies by the Allied soldiers. \u201cWe were more afraid of Koean-born soldiers than the Japanese soldiers,\u201d by an Australian POW, Kennith Harrison. \u201cJapanese soldiers were in the worst case punched us, but Korean-born soldiers were very cruel as compared to the Japanese soldiers. This fact was well known amongst the Allies POWs,\u201d by an Australian POW, G. Clark. The Korean soldiers were very merciless in Manchuria, too, and the following picture was actually presented to a Chinese Court to show their cruelty. Cruelty of South Korean soldiers was notorious in the Vietnam War as well. Tens of thousands were tortured to death, raped or massacred. The facts are published in Vietnam and US. Also, they now have a big issue of Lai Dai Hans from all their raping. But\u2026.. It was no invading. Japan fought against the Western countries that colonized and enslaved the Asia for hundreds of years, not against the natives. Japan was the last independent country. After the WWII when everything became clear, on May 3, 1951, MacArthur testified at the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, which is the highest committee in which US military personnel can testify, that Japan fought for its national security (not for invasion). Koreans, Chinese and Indians were also part of the force. Koreans were forced to fight with the army in exchange for safety and food for their families. Chinese some of them are working for the Manchuria area. Indians are those who seek to gain independence from United Kingdom. The main purpose is the few i listed, but sometimes human greed made them do certain atrocities such as rape. Ultimately regardless if it is non-Japanese it is still the minority of them doing such deeds over the Japanese. Even if they did such deeds, some are forced upon by their superior which are usually a Japanese. Lastly, it is still the fault of the higher up of such occurrence which means the colonel and generals who didn\u2019t stop it from happening. To your question:  Yes there are various nationality whom fight with the Japanese, but the war crimes are still the Japanese faults because this deed are managed by high ranking officers which are Japanese. Japanese are also known to force even their own people from doing atrocities, let alone conscripts soldiers from other nationality.",

        "a": "This might sound rhetoric and might not even answer the question, nevertheless it\u2019s worth thinking over. Do your deeds redeem the misdeeds of your past ? What might you\u2019ve done had you been in Jamie\u2019s position when Bran had caught him in the act ? Picture this; you\u2019re the son of Tywin Lannister, leader of one of the strongest houses in Westeros. You\u2019re one of the most decorated knights out there, known for your inherent talent with the blade and skill in battle. Would you risk putting your reputation on the line by letting Bran live ? No doubt, it was a heinous act and crippling a child who had his entire future right in front of him isn\u2019t justifiable on any count, however Jamie didn\u2019t do it for the fun of it. He had a reason to do so. If you believe in karma, Jamie has already paid up for this in a manner of speaking. With his sword hand maimed, he is no longer the finest knight in Westeros and barely capable of beating a stable-boy. Look at the sheer amount of despair all over his face. He is no longer the proud, haughty and despicable man he used to be.  Clearly, he\u2019s changed. To wrap it up, it all depends on the reader. Everyone deserves a crack at redemption. If you ask me, he has already paid for his act in full. Karma caught up with him like it does with everyone. How does Jaime Lannister's story end? Is Jaime Lannister evil? Does Jaime Lannister like the Starks now? Is Jaime Lannister in love with Brienne of Tarth? Who are the three people who could match Jaime Lannister in a fight? He acted out of self preservation. He doesn\u2019t need anyone to forgive him. Nor does he give a f**k. If he hadn\u2019t pushed Bran out the window, Bran most likely would have ran and blabbed to his father and then all the Lannisters would be in trouble. Jaime would get hunted down and hammered through the chest. Cersei gets beheaded. Tywin gets beheaded. The crowd favorite, poor little twisted Tyrion gets his giant head lopped off. Joff, Myrcella and plump Tommen get slaughtered the same way Robert\u2019s bastards got slaughtered at the order of Cersei. In a way, Jaime once again saved more people than he crippled. In a moral sense of things, perhaps Jaime is never forgivable for the wrongs he has done. His good deeds do not cancel out his bad deeds. He had sex with his sister and fathered bastards who are products of abominations. But what moral sense shall be applied here? Why doesn\u2019t anyone question \u201cIs Aegon the Conqurer forgivable?\u201d He fucked two of his sisters and sired children on them. He killed quite many men and probably innocent children when he burnt and melted Harrenhal. Why is he forgivable? Those children were innocent. Only Harren the Black should have been seized. His people probably didn\u2019t want to fight a creepy dragon-riding foreigner at all. But they burnt nonetheless. The answer to the above question is \u201cbecause Aegon I is romanticized as he was apparently for unification and advancement of society.\u201d I say he was a ruthless Valyrian after dominance and subjugation of a continent. His good deeds don\u2019t cancel out his bad deeds. Essentially, It all depends on one\u2019s preconceived notions and pespectives. Ned Stark beheaded an  innocent  man (Will). Just because he failed to acknowledge that the Others have re-emerged. Will had an  excuse  for his desertion. True that desertion is a crime, but Will was branded insane and a liar as well. Of all people, a Stark should have believed him as Starks are the pillar against the doom that comes with the Others. Jaime saved himself and his house and probably the whole of Westerlands. Bran was a nosey little shit who snooped on them where it wasn\u2019t his place. I love Bran but he clearly butted in someone els\u2019s business and paid for it. At the same time, if Bran hadn\u2019t fallen, he wouldn\u2019t have become the new 3EC or have his inner ability awakened as some form of truama is needed for the abilities to awaken. In a weird way, Jaime did the realm another favor. From a Jaime sympathiser point of view, he had  NO  other choice. From a moral point of view, Jaime is guilty of pushing a child out of the window and much more that can not be forgiven. It all depends on which perspective you look at it from and which era we are in. Incest was very common in the times of old. It is rightly a crime these days. Jaime has done plenty of good that no one ever finds out or credits him for. As readers we can either like him, or hate him. It all depends on us. I, personally hated him for pushing out Bran, but loved him when I read through his PoVs. I no longer hate him for pushing out Bran. What else could he have done? Bran wargs and mindfucks Hodor all the time and he clearly wasted Hodor\u2019s life just to hold a door for him when Bran needs it, do we forgive Bran? I pose another question in response to this. \u201cWhat would any of you do if you were in Jaime\u2019s position and got caught?\u201d That\u2019s a moral question. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a book reader or not, but in the books, it\u2019s made clear that the same hand that pushed Bran out the window and crippled him was the exact same hand that was cut off. I don\u2019t know anything about forgiveness, but he PAID for what he did by losing what made him Jaime Lannister, and it happened to have been the hand that crippled Bran Stark. Bran is about to be more powerful than anyone in Westeros, and Jaime has been diminished to the point where he has lost everything that\u2019s made him who he is. In the books, he has lost Cersei and his hand, as he knows that Cersei has been unfaithful to him and has cut off communication with her. This makes Jaime complex, but it also shows that none of us can say who deserves forgiveness and who doesn\u2019t. All it says is that he has paid for what he did to Bran dearly, and he even reflected on it in one of his chapters. I do think that Jamie has redeemed himself in a big a way and he is forgivable. Plus if he becomes the one who kills Cersie then there will be no question to his sincerity.",

        "a": "LeBron James  carried a 2007 Cleveland Cavalier team, whose next best players were Mo Williams and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, to the NBA Finals. If Lebron played for the Brooklyn Nets, it may be possible for them to at least reach the East Semis since they have slightly better versions of the 2 aforementioned players in  Jeremy Lin  and  Brook Lopez . The Nets did chase after Lebron in the summer of 2010. The image below could\u2019ve been but now would only be possible in NBA myLeague or myGM modes. How do you stop Lebron James? Should LeBron James be the 2015 NBA Finals MVP even if the Cavaliers lose the series? What if Lebron James had Love and Irving in the 2015 NBA Finals? Can Lebron take any team to the finals? Would the 2011-2014 Miami Heat have made it to the NBA Finals without LeBron James? With the way Lebron has been playing in these playoffs its hard to pick against him regardless of his supporting cast. He\u2019s averageing 34.8 points, 9 rebounds, and 7 assists. In today\u2019s NBA Lebron can thrive by playing the point-forward, facilitating the offense, and looking for shooters. As long as you surround Lebron with enough shooters and players who will compete on defense and do the dirty work I could definitely see him leading a team like the Nets to the finals. Keep in mind that the Nets play in the much weaker Eastern conference and even if Lebron were able to take them to the finals they would have almost no chance against these Warriors. (Side note: I said \u201calmost\u201d no chance. I\u2019ve learned to never completely count Lebron out. Just think back to the finals a couple years ago when he took the Warriors to 6 games WITHOUT Kyrie and Kevin Love.) Back to the Nets, they have shooters in Jeremy Lin and Randy Foye. We saw this year how Brook Lopez changed his game and actually became a real threat from beyond the arc, which would be ideal when playing with Lebron. They have players like Quincy Acy and Hollis-Jefferson to do the dirty work a la Tristan Thompson. Bojan Bogdanovic would have been an ideal three point threat to surround Lebron with had the Nets not traded him to Washington. Overall with way that the NBA game is played now, with an emphasis on spacing and three point shooting Lebron is the perfect player to lead an offense and take over in the last 5 minutes. Obviously the Nets roster is not as talented as the current Cavs roster and the Wizards, Celtics, and Raptors series won\u2019t be sweeps if Lebron played for the Nets, but with the way Lebron is currently playing its hard to see him lose to anyone in the East. Yes. LeBron did it before. Iverson did it before. Lebron would also lose in 4 or 5 games like he and Iverson did in 2007 and 2000, respectively. Like Bill Simmons said, the 1-man ball dominant superstar formula has never translated into a championship - but it does lead to a finals berth every once in a while. *caveat, the finals berth is only possible because the east has been historically underwhelming for a while, save for a season here and there. Just LeBron? No. No team has ever managed to get all the way there with just one superstar. The only example I can think of in recent memory that managed to do this are the 2003\u20132004 Pistons, and that depends on what you think of Chauncy Billups and Rip Hamilton and Rasheed Wallace. That was the last team to go all the way without at least one clear Hall of Famer in the lineup, and usually two. LeBron has made the finals 6 years running because he\u2019s been surrounded by other great players \u2014 period. He did not take Miami or Cleveland there by himself. Just like Michael couldn\u2019t take the Bulls there by himself; he needed Scotty and a lot of very skilled role players. Look at Michael Westbrook and OKC. They barely made the playoffs. Also: LeBron is on the down slope of his career. Yes, he is currently killing it in the playoffs. But not for much longer. IMPOSSIBLE\u2026 Lebron will not even consider it, unless he gets 2 or more superstars with him\u2026",

Consider the work you've done for your uni newspaper, any blog posts, coursework (if you're happy with quality and variety of the things you've written) Start small. Try writing for your local newspaper or small online magazines who often look for contributions. Browse through their content and prepare a couple of ideas you can pitch. It's important to start writing, make contacts, and learn the tools of the trade of this ever-evolving industry first. Knock on as many doors as you can. Seize the opportunity! Consider fashion blogging, too. Find your style, maybe write style round-ups, celeb fashion articles and longer features? It can also help you grow your portfolio.

The USB Micro-B port on that speaker is most likely just used for charging the battery. The USB Type-A port on the speaker is power-only, to allow you to keep your phone or PMP charged while playing. I have a Bluetooth speaker with exactly that configuration. However, read on. Your speaker has is that tiny slot next to the USB Type-A slot. Its hard to tell from the fuzzy photo, but maybe that's a MicroSD / TransFlash card slot? If so, that implies the unit might support its own playback from memory devices. I also note that the USB Type-A connector has all four pins. Sometimes a charge-only port leaves out the middle data pins. Try it \u2026 or, well, there's always the user manual. Just sayin'\u2026. Small devices are often picky about what they will and won't play. Get a smaller USB stick, do a clean FAT format on it, and drop in a couple of MP3 files compressed at 128kb/s, constant data rate. Then plug in and see if it'll play them or not. Can I charge a portable speaker using a USB port? What is a eSATA port for? Is it one of these useful in a laptop or I can use the USB port to connect an external HDD? How can I play movies in LG TV using a USB port? What is the difference between a USB 2.0 and a USB 3.0? Will USB 2.0 ports support USB 3.0 portable drives or pen drives? Can I use USB 2.0 in USB 3.0 port? You can use your USB key to play music. Format your USB with Fat32 or NTFS Format first (for auto read of that USB, check your USB type to know which format type is for your USB disk .) then load it with .mp3 files. Same works for MicroSD card. Format, and load up. You can also hook up your phone/tablet via BT for wireless music. OR you can use your phone/mp3/mp4 players with an Aux Cord and use it as a regular wired speaker. Aux cords are cheap to find, most phones have BT feature, and any PC can format the usb disk .",

        "a": "It\u2019s very hard to teach people to love themselves. It is usually something someone learns over a course of time, and very few people have actually come round to fully loving themselves! Honestly, attraction is not at all purely focused on physical looks. For you it is, as you are used to your personality but you don\u2019t see yourself all the time, so are not completely familiar with how you look, if that makes sense. Attraction relies heavily on the person\u2019s mentality and personality. I personally have become attracted to people who didn\u2019t catch my eye at first purely because their personality drew me in so much. Also, people rarely see themselves as the level of attractive that they actually are. To others, you could be beautiful. Even if you aren\u2019t society\u2019s picture of perfection (although no one is), you could be beautiful due to your own unique features, and uniqueness is exciting, its a nice break from the norm. At the end of the day, looks change. Your body will get bigger and smaller depending on your diet, exercise, age, and many other things Your skin will get blemishes, your skin will also have periods of time when it is better, thats just life and no one is excluded from that Your hair will grow, can get cut, dyed, bleached, permed, styled. However, your personality matures. Your personality is so valuable, and is something that can get better and better with something as simple as changing your mindset. If I were you, I\u2019d work on just that. I\u2019d look for the positives in everything, instead of drowning in the negatives. I\u2019d stop giving a shit about what people think of how I look, because if that\u2019s all they care about, I don\u2019t want shallow people like them in my life. I\u2019d find hobbies and interests that make me happy, and pursue them. In fact, I did all that. And I\u2019m way happier than I was before. Obviously, everyone cares about how they look. I\u2019m not telling you not to, it\u2019s normal to take pride in your appearance. But it shouldn\u2019t be the most important thing about you. How do I get over the fact that I'm ugly? What should I do if I feel like everyone hates me? Am I going into a depression? What can I do not to hate myself? I love my behaviour and people are inspired by me. I am inteligent and smart, but I hate myself because I am ugly and my body is very uncomfor... Is it wrong that I feel insulted when ugly guys ask me out on a date? I'm not looking for pity. I feel Ugly. People tell me all the time that I'm beautiful girls and guys. Im pretty confident. How do I love mysel... You are insecure about yourself, your face, hair and so on. Its normal to be insecure about things. Every human has something we are all insecure about,alot of people just learn to live with it because its natural and there is no one single person who is perfect. And you just need to start feeling that way too. Simple. You can start by maybe changing your routines, exercise a little more, change your diet to feel good about your intake, dress in new ways you feel comfortable with, try finding new people and start doing something new and different. But whatever you do, please, DO NOT get plastic surgery to enhance anything in your body. Dont do that, you will feel even more insecure because you would be living with the thoughts of having something artificial in you. And the natural you is more beautiful. Yes, you must learn to love yourself..how? Start by appreciating yourself and feeling comfortable with yourself. That's a start. The difficult part is to start. You can, and things will fall into place little by little. I have felt (am) this way. I tried to commit suicide but failed (obviously). Your life should NEVER be ruled by what other people think about you. It is a gift, no matter what religion you are in. IT WILL ALWAYS BE A MIRACLE THAT YOU ARE ALIVE. You (may) only have one shot at life, so don\u2019t waste it on people\u2019s opinions. I have been bullied and beaten, but I am here today, because I looked around and realized that everyone is living. The bullies, my friends, family, even the mailman (LOL), everyone lives in if they have problems and regrets (maybe at the same extent as us, or not), but they ARE alive and plan on living. I think that we should strive for life. I mean, the bully that punched, kicked, terrorized, and made (me) cry, is still living, and he used me as a stress bag for his own insecurities. If he has a right to live\u2026 Then, you do too! You WILL meet people who you think are close enough to tell this about, and the friends who stick around will be your TRUE friends. I was like you, I felt alone, hated myself, and wanted to die, but I met a very close friend of mine, who has helped me to live. If you think that you won\u2019t make a friend soon, then the healthiest thing to do is to tell someone. Even if it isn\u2019t your family, maybe a friend, counselor, or even a leader at a camp, you can ask for discretion, but after having a good cry while talking about it, you will feel SO much better. I hope that you will take my advice and tell someone. You are amazing for sharing this, and I would love to give you a HUGE hug. There will always be someone who cares for you, even if you don\u2019t believe it. Even strangers who pass by you care for your safety (even if they don\u2019t think about it). I will be cheering you on! Good luck! PS: Plastic surgery doesn\u2019t really work out of the time, one, because they mess up, and two, it sometimes looks unnatural. It is also worth 100\u2019s of thousands of dollars\u2026. So, don\u2019t risk it! It sounds as if you are depressed and this is forcing you to focus on all your perceived bad points. Maybe you should consider therapy or talk to a really good friend who is understanding and sympathetic. Get your focus back on the good things in your life and the good points in your character. In the UK the family doctor is the first point of call for getting help. Not sure where you are? Don\u2019t suffer alone and get help. The Samaritans can lend an ear too on the phone. It doesn\u2019t have to get to crisis point before you can call them. First; learn to \u201clike yourself\u201d. Everyone\u2014and I mean everyone has likable qualities. Everyone\u2014and I mean everyone would like to look better, be smarter, have a natural charming personality, posses advantaged skills, gain financial independence, control events in their lives, et cetera\u2014no matter how currently gifted. It follows that nobody\u2014and I mean nobody is content on the outside. Perhaps, the more they have (or get) the more they fear losing it. But those who learn to \u201clike themselves\u201d are more likely to find contentment within. Those things on the outside are not lasting qualities. Learning to \u201clike your self\u201d is an internal process that brings lasting contentment. It is a life long journey raising the bar and expanding those internal qualities that allow you to \u201clike yourself\u201d Find the \u201cI like myself\u201d inside you. Embrace it.",

        "a": "I know an organization which was attacked by this ransomware few days back. An employee who was working in Sales sector got a phishing mail and he didn't pay much attention whether it is fake or not he just clicked the mail and downloaded the attachment in it. When he opened the attachment and run the executable file, in a few moment his computer was encrypted and he got dialog box stating info about the ransomware and money to be paid. This ransomware also works as a worm. As soon as it infected one computer it started searching and scanning for another hosts in the same network and infected every system which had unpatched version of Windows having SMB vulnerability. Although Tech sector employees knew what to do and what not to do but apart from them neither of the employees had knowledge about any security measures regarding ransomware. After this incident happened the employees were instructed not to give money as after getting money they may or may not decrypt your files. Also $600 is not a small amount to take a bet on. All the computers were formatted by the network administrator and they also conducted cyber security meetings for every employees of the company to make them aware of situation. Anyone can be a victim to this ransomware. The strongest link to infect any computer by using ransomware is human stupidity because if no one will open the mail and download the attachment in the first place then there might not be any victims to this ransomware. Everyone should be aware of Social engineering attacks. It can be through mobile, mails or website links. Hackers are using more and more advance methods of social engineering attacks to lure the people into their trap. That's why it's important for every one to be aware of current cyber attacks. I hope this answer helps! How do I prevent a WannaCry ransomware attack? How can I keep my computer safe from Wannacry ransomware? Who saved the world from the ransomware attack \"Wannacry\"? What is WannaCry? Is it the same as Ransomware? What is WannaCry attack? Fucking annoying The company I work with was compromised. They were able to shut down the network before it could spread all over the place. Nevertheless, damage was done. As far as I know, they are not sure yet, where WannaCry entered the system. That is, it is unknown who was stupid enough to click on the infected link (probably sent by email). Luckily, those who were infected first, called the IT department immediately. Those poor guys then spent the whole weekend to put out the fire. Paying up was never an option. The infected computers got a new installation. The back up data was not compromised, so there isn\u2019t much data loss. Since the attack happened on a Friday afternoon, many had started their weekend already. So, many computers weren\u2019t connected to the network in the first place. Every single computer was kicked out of the network and had to be added back to it after it was proven clean. This took a while and made working at the beginning of the week quite impossible. That was the annoying part. Hopefully, it will teach a lesson to everyone not to click on links form unknown sources. I never experienced it personally, but I\u2019ve met a lot of people who did. (Ransomware viruses in general) Most of them got the virus by an email, that email had a MS Word file attached to it. Upon opening that file, the victim was asked to enable macros so that he could see the document\u2019s content. When he did that, the code was executed and the virus was installed. Some people could use their desktop and some could not depending on the kind of Ransomware that they got, but they all had one thing in common, they all had lost their files. How did they feel? Desperation and sadness are the first words that come to my mind when I think of them. Just imagine if you had a lifetime\u2019s worth of photos in your drive only to lose them in a moment by some virus. Or if you were an employee who had some really important documents on his business laptop, chances are that you would get fired for losing them. How did they react? For once, I never heard of someone calling the authorities after getting infected with the Ransomware virus and I think that it was the right decision. After all, these cyber criminals have taken all the precautions to avoid getting caught. Some of them would pay up, while others would seek help on the internet (hence how I\u2019m here to tell this story) and they would try to restore the files that they lost on their own. The majority of them could only restore a small portion of their files or non at all, even some of the ones who paid didn\u2019t manage to get their files back. And by the way, as you can see  here , all it takes to protect yourself from such viruses is to stay updated and maybe rely on a security program while you don\u2019t open any suspicious emails and such. It\u2019s not that hard is it? Stay safe people. A few devices on our network were attacked, it was an email with attachment from a trusted contact (it wasn\u2019t a unknown email or contact) and the employees opened the email. From what I can tell everything froze up before we were given the message to pay the ransomware fee. I\u2019m pretty confident in our configuration and rightfully so, we were able to roll abck our machines (we use  RollBack Rx ) and it took the machines back to before the email was opened and the computers infected. We\u2019re now back up and running! I am just been told by one of my friend that HCL technologies computer are also been attacked by WannCry ransomware. Ransomware ,  Cryptolocker  & Locky are some of the most infected viruses which enter the users system through email attachments and encrypt the files in the system such that it can\u2019t be decrypted by any antivirus software till now. To save critical data, the user needs to pay a ransom amount through online payment and after that it\u2019s up to the wish of the hackers that they will provide the decrypt key to the user. Computer users are increasing at a rapid rate all around the globe. Simultaneously there is a huge increase in the development of unknown threats like viruses, spywares, malwares and so on. These viruses some time get into your system through external hardware devices (like pen drive, memory card, and external hard disks), internet access and malicious free software. But most of the antivirus software is capable of detecting these viruses, spyware & malwares. But from quite a recent period of time, there is news of a new virus attack with various names like ransomware, cryptolocker, locky virus and so on. I have researched a lot about this new virus attack. This virus usually enters the user\u2019s computer through email coming from trusted email ids like from company\u2019s email server. The virus first attacks the mail server of any particular company and then sends an email id containing an attachment to the various contact lists. When any person receives an email from its company\u2019s mail server, he/she usually trust the email and open it to see the content. The email contact is made like that the person is sure that the email is genuine and after that it download the attachment. When the person opens the attachment, the ransomware virus starts encrypting files in the system with some algorithm and gives it some extension like .locky. There are certain ways which can be tried to remove this virus attacked and to decrypt the virus encrypted data: 1. If you have set a restore point in your system, the there might be a chance that you can get back to the stable state at which you have your setup point. For choosing a restore point in your system, follow step: \u00b7 From the Start menu, type: Restore in the Search programs and files dialog box. \u00b7 From the list of results, click System Restore. \u00b7 In the System Restore window, click Next. \u00b7 From the list of restore points, select the Date and Time you wish to restore from. 2. If this doesn\u2019t work out and the data which is encrypted by ransomware virus is very confidential and critical, then the last option is to pay a ransom amount to the hackers. When the user opens the browser, its prompts that it has been locked by ransomware and provides steps to make a payment like $500 through online payment. This is not a guarantee that they will provide the user with the decryption key."
