       "\"Depends of what type of person you are and of what you want. Mathematics is perfection, is fiction, is pure logic. You can have two points of view on mathematics: It is a world that  you build  by creating your functions, setting your rules, seing what happens then. Or it is a world that starts to exists once you have settled the undemonstrable basic rules and that  you discover. Physics is also pretty much perfect in its theories but is way more applicative. You observe and measure. From that you build models that have the goal to fit the most yours observations. And then, you do your best to  prove yourself wrong.  If you fail to prove yourself wrong, then maybe your theory/model is close to reality. Often researchers discover/measure new things that will disprove models and in these cases new models are created to fit the “measured” reality. And the “ultimate goal” is to find a model that answers everything (energetic, matter, laws of physics, aso..) I would say that both are really enjoyable and astounding. In my case, I really prefer mathematics because I am the dreaming/geeky/living in fiction type of person and because I sense too much bounderies in our universe possibilities. So, short answer: both are nice, and the better is subjective and really depends on you. (It is only my opinion, I am no expert on the subject; also, sorry for bad english, french being my mothertongue.) Are Physics majors better at mathematics than Math majors? What is the role of mathematics in physics? How can we use mathematics and physics to live better? Why do we need mathematics to explain physics? I have two options front of me. One is doing an honors physics major amd the other one is a physics major with mathematics minor. Which one is... I majored in physics because I hated math. Not that physics isn't all math. But physics makes math make sense. Frankly, I found that the way math is taught by mathematicians overemphasizes A Right Way To Do Math that made math taught by many mathematicians distinctly unenjoyable. In one math course in particular, a professor launched into a minute-long tirade when asked the simple question by a student, “How is this applied?” The answer from another student that the concepts being studied were used in combinatorial chemistry and quantum mechanics brought that professor's enmity for the rest of that student's attendance at the university. Let me ask a counter question . Who is better father , mother , sister , brother We cannot answer right? Because all four are equally important. Physics , Mathematics , Chemistry all are important , interconnected. It is our perception that makes them different and better over one other. All are study of nature in their pure form. It depends on your interest which makes one better than other. If a physicist is brilliant in maths, it would be useful for him as he can use the maths into the derivations effortlessly. and he'd be a better phyisicist! However knowing too much physics won’t help a mathematician in any way. It would be preposterous for a mathematician, as he won't be able to use it in any sort of way! And without mathematical proofs, physics would be nothing more than some collection of facts! This interpretation puts the mathematician onto the higher position. However I've developed greater fondness towards physics recently. So I'm really not in the position to answer this question! :P\""
