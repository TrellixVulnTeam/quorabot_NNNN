A very presumptive “weight loss diet” chart, one must say! Anyhow: “Steam fish” (this is not a type of fish but ANY fish which has been steamed) can be substituted by Paneer or Soya “Watermelon juice” could be substituted with melon / papaya / orange / apple / tomato juice. The objective is to drink fruit juice for it’s vitamin content One has to mention here that one need not avoid eating whole eggs, as yolks are no longer considered unhealthy for the heart. This prejudice was there earlier based on “studies” conducted in US, which has been reversed by US health authorities. They now recommend that one can eat whole eggs, butter etc. and that will not have any bad effects on cardiac health. Please also look at “LCHF diet” (Low Carb, High Fat) for weight loss. That would mean cutting out all bread, rice, chapatis, potatoes etc. from diet. It is extremely effective for weight loss., without starving the person or causing mental unhappiness, which is caused by the perpetual feeling of hunger.
It’s interesting to note that after three decades of leading edge work, global sustainability veteran Paul Hawken decries the use of “violence” rhetoric. “We understand the use of these terms because they convey the gravity of what we face and the tightening window of time to address global warming. Yet, terms such as “combat” “battle”, and “crusade” imply that climate change is the enemy and needs to be slain” - Paul Hawken, 2017  Drawdown It’s also worth keeping in mind substantial research indicating that simply generating fear creates trauma, helplessness and INACTION. What would happen if you rephrased your question? What are some profitable, constructive, anthropogenic solutions to global warming that sequester greenhouse gases, regenerate ecosystems and create food security? You might find yourself reading the results of the most recent research that quantifies actionable solutions for turning climate change around, including: “Drawdown: The most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming” “Business Lessons from a Radical Industrialist” “The Upcycle” These would lead you to discovering exciting new business and career opportunities in the technologies and design principles of studies such as: The Blue Economy Systemic Design The Circular Economy Biomimicry You could even find your way into the innovation knowledge base that explores the art and science of upgrading the human systems that deliver our products and services: Generative Innovation Systems Thinking Ontological Coaching How can you be part of the solution if all you can talk about is fear, poverty and threat?
ECE at DTU of course. I know of people who gave up Chemical at IIT Roorkee to pursue CSE at DTU. Branch matters too. If you are good enough you can end up being a consultant at top firm or operations manager from BITS . I don’t know the exact stats of BITS but this is true for any top firm institution. But these opportunities are no less in DTU. Else if you are more interested in the technical side of things then ECE at DTU is the obvious choice
Yes, you can in general. If you want to learn and earn, proper commitment is needed and if you give proper commitment you will not be able to work in multiple clubs. Otherwise I haven't seen any clubs with policy that participation in multiple groups isn't allowed. Is it worth it to join SRM University for a BTech in Computer Sciences. How is the scope at SRM? Is there a media club at SRM KTR? If so, how does one join it? Can we be a member of more than one club in MIT, Manipal? Which one should I join if I got admission in both: SRM Chennai or IIST? Which is better, SRM or Manipal University? You can join as many cultural clubs you want. But keep in mind that you are ablento keep up with their schedules and practices. But if you are a part of clubs like Conrods, Camber, Robocon etc, you hsve to be exclusive with them. You can be removed form these clubs if you try to double time. So choose your clubs wisely. Try to find a balance between these clubs. Cheers! It depends on the Club terms nd condition. But I think no because if you join two clubs then you are not able to give full time . And they expect a full dedication

I don't think I understand the question. Declensions are inherently associated with nouns; each noun simply  is  a certain declension. When using each noun in a sentence, you determine the proper case and use the corresponding ending. For example, if I use the word  puella  (girl) in a sentence, as the object of a preposition that takes an accusative object, I use the first declension singular accusative ending, in this case - am . Curro ad puellam . I run towards the girl. Why does Vietnam use the Latin alphabet in their writing system? Is that a wise choice? What is the Latin word for hand and what other language/s uses a similar word? How useful is Latin? What is the use of Latin 200 medicine? In Latin, can the word "ultra" be used of time? Yes, there is a hard rule. First, the whole phenomenon of declension applies mainly to nouns, adjectives and pronouns. If you don’t know what these terms mean, you should look them up before going on. It also applies to some words derived from verbs, which are participles, supine, gerund and gerundive - these need not concern you right now. Secondly, the rule for deciding which declension to use with each noun or adjective is… look it up in the dictionary. With extremely few exceptions (indeclinable words, mostly of non-Latin origin) each and every of these nouns and adjectives belong to one such class. The dictionary entry, by itself, should tell you to which of these classes a given word belongs. Please comment if you need a tip about how to do this. Keep in mind - this is a point seldom stressed - that  declension   is a name used for  two  things: the  phenomenon  of declension itself - that is, the changes that occur to the ending of the declinable words, depending on how they are used in a sentence - and the  patterns  which said declension follows. Every noun, save the few indeclinables, belongs to one such patterns or classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th), which are also called declensions. The declension to which each noun  belongs  is defined and fixed, it never changes, and you learn it from the dictionary. The exact way to  decline  a given word depends on it use in the sentence at hand. You don't choose declensions. You choose the dooper noun for the usage. For example: I love water. For water, I would use  aqua . It happens to be first declension. However, you do need to be mindful of declension endings. If I were to use  pater  in a sentence, I couldn't use 2nd declension endings, as it is a 3rd declension word. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th declensions refer to the various delensional patterns, and each Latin noun falls into one. Puella, girl, falls in first, puella, (girl) puellae (girls) puer, (boy) pueri (boys) is second, while lupus (wolf) lupi (wolves) is also second as is bellum (war) bella (wars) which is also neuter. Aakash has it exactly right. You don’t choose the declension; you choose the noun you want for your sentence. The noun is in one of five declensions. Look it up in the dictionary to see which declension it is. Also check the gender. Then write your sentence. The gender will be necessary if you want to use an adjective with the noun. Actually, the idea of first to fifth declensions was decided hundreds of years after Latin ceased to be a living language. Some grammarians noticed that certain nouns always had the same endings, and, to make it easier for learners, they decided that those nouns were (for example) in first declension. The grammarians were actually trying to make it easier for you to deal with Latin. If you decided to go back in time to ancient Rome, you would learn all nouns one by one and figure out their declension one by one. That is what Roman babies had to do.
Let me preface this a bit by saying I’m always leery of this certain kind of modern hero worship associated with popular culture nowadays. You know, the cavalcade of notifications or memorials we see in social media. As if the anointed of our culture - celebrities - get some kind of special status. They get this kind of default or obligatory public mourning, in other words. I normally don’t fall into that kind of popular culture norm. If I didn’t know someone, I rarely feel much of anything at the news of their passing. Life is short, we die. And celebrity status is inconsequential. Ya know? But, in Cornell’s case…yeah, I’m actually feeling quite sad. I really liked his music. And it was part of my formative years, or various life paths. I got into this type of music in my late teens/early 20s. I blasted Soundgarden in Iraq, rolling down MSR Tampa in 2003–4. The earlier, heavy sound made a good soundtrack to that experience. As I got older and perhaps a bit more contemplative (but still enjoyed a heavy guitar riffing style of rock) Audioslave came around, about the time I was dealing with the effects of PTSD, although, I didn’t recognize it back then. Anyway, the music resonated with me. I dug it. Played it. Really liked it. Anyway, I’m sorry he was struggling with depression and felt so desperate or sad. By the way, the “grunge” label was always a sort of fabrication or construct anyway. His vocals were just solid. That’s all you can really say. Pitch, key…spot on. Good range. Vibrato? On fucking POINT! Case in point: What was the cause of Chris Cornell's death at age 52? What does this quote from Chris Cornell mean? What are the lyrics to Chris Cornell's "You Know My Name"? As a tribute to Chris Cornell, what is your favorite Chris Cornell song? What was Chris Cornell like in person? I was on the bus this morning making my usual journey into work and listening to music on my music player while browsing the web on my phone. I happened to be listening to Soundgarden. While I was listening to “Rowing”, I got a push notification from Google about the news and was shocked! I’m not one to be affected by celebrity deaths but Chris is different. I grew up in a small town in India and wasn’t really exposed to rock and metal music until I was about 19–20 years old. This was in the noughties, so, one of the bands I came across was Audioslave. Over the years, I also discovered Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog and Chris’ solo stuff. He became my vocal inspiration and I wished to have an ounce of the talent he has (now, ‘had’). So, since the moment I read the news, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. I feel an inexplicable loss. I saw him live for the first time on his solo tour last year and I hoped to one day see Soundgarden live as well. Alas, it will never happen. Update : It's been four days now and I still can't stop thinking about it. It was really sad, heartbreaking and gutting, and I was left totally shocked and speechless by the surprising news several hours ago. Losing Chris was   very difficult for me because his work was a huge part of my teenage years, and growing up I would not have discovered music as my channel for expression outside the daily stresses of life had I never heard his soulful voice. The first tune I heard from the man was his cover of Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean, which was possibly  one of the greatest covers I have heard  besides Jeff Buckley’s cover of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah - I was immediately blown away by the sheer spine-tingling emotion he expressed into those lyrics. At the same time, Soundgarden and Audioslave were some of the first hard rock and heavy metal groups I listened to, and having heard his glorious work with both groups I am always in awe with Cornell’s talent as a vocalist - he was not just a powerhouse (dude had a monstrous range and retained it even until the day he died), but also a true original and a real artist who never failed to bare his soul to his listeners. RIP Sir - thank you for all the music and the memories, and forever you will always be one of my biggest inspirations in being a better vocalist and musician. Before I talk about his death and what it means to me, Chris Cornell has been my man-crush and one of my heroes since I was about 12. I’m 35 now. My musical tastes have broadened considerably since I first heard “Outshined” on the radio growing up in east Phoenix, but his voice always takes me back to that time and place. A place where I romanticized Seattle as a sort of City Upon a Hill for the disaffected, apathetic, creative types and other nonconformists who were “too cool for school.” Seattle was pretty far (1400 miles give or take), but seemed worlds away from the drab strip malls, sun-baked streets and stucco homes of Phoenix. Seattle seemed to me back then a paragon of alternative music, art and culture nestled in the Pacific Northwest. Soundgarden and other bands from that area were my ticket to that ideal of Seattle I had in my head. As for what his death means to me? Joe Rogan’s reaction in the first 15 seconds of this video pretty much sums it up: Where he made that face and mumbled “fuck”, that’s how I felt when I woke up to the news on Thursday morning. I was in shock for a few hours, but afterward I realized something as tributes continued to stream in from all over the world. The guy touched a lot of fucking lives. A. Lot. He may have left this planet way too soon, but he left a musical legacy that will never be duplicated. That voice! That hair! Those looks! The music! So sad. But that’s nowhere near the saddest part, which I am still struggling with not quite 72 hours after his passing. And that is the fact that he leaves behind a beautiful family that no longer have him there for all of life’s important moments. Two teenagers and a preteen that no longer have their dad. A grieving widow that no longer has her life partner and best friend. To me, that’s what’s really tragic about this whole thing. Go ask Frances Bean Cobain how “romantic” and “cool” her dad’s death at age 27 was. You’ll probably get a punch to the face. She’s said on many occasions that she’d rather have her father still alive than all of that bullshit dead-rockstar mythology that surrounds him. I would feel the same way. Chris Cornell could have died 20 years ago or just flat out retired from music and his work would stand on its own merits, solidifying him as one of the all-time greats. It’s the gaping hole he left in his family that will never be repaired that really hurts me. I’m a human being before I’m a fan, and this really sucks. Edit: I’ve uploaded a podcast dedicated to Chris Cornell on Buzzsprout. I am currently trying to get a regular music podcast going and distributed in the near future. If you want to hear my tribute to him, click here: David Hunsdon's Podcast I understand there are some pops and what not, but I wanted my reaction to be raw. Thanks and hope you enjoy it.
Well, firstly it mainly lies in your interest. Though at this stage it's hard to say what a person wants as you may hardly know what a BDS student does in his ug years. Like any other person I wanted to be a Dr., a MBBS Dr. more specifically. I didn't think or actually consider dentistry until the results were out. I was like I wouldn't want to put my hand in someone else's mouth for the rest of my life. This was me prior to PMT (premedical test; previously there wasn't NEET). Results were out and I couldn't get MBBS. That was saddening. I realised that the next option was BDS, or for that reason even Ayurveda and Homeopathy were available. I had a choice of biotech engineering (I guess that was what it's called) in VIT. But i wasn't keen on engineering, gave the exam just because my brother had asked me to. There was another option and that was to take a drop. But I knew myself that I wouldn't be able to study. The break wouldn't be fruitful. So I chose BDS. So initially I had chosen to give PMT again though my senior had said that doing both BDS and PMT studies isn't possible. Then there was an orientation lecture given by Dr. Manish Aggrawal, a prosthodontist where he said that most of us didn't choose BDS but his lecture made me choose to continue BDS. Yeah, he was inspiring, a person who my senior had already said to look forward to. The first year of BDS, and I was like, ‘Why are we working with wax, plaster, etc? We aren't masons or sculptors to do these things!’ Yeah, that was me initially. But these things are the central part of dentistry: Dental Material; dentistry will forever be grateful to dental materials. Every year, we learn something and the practical work that we do in first year is the very useful and important in our lives if we want to continue to practice dentistry. Today, I'm an intern and I absolutely love my work, whether it's treating patients or doing lab work. It's all art and science in dentistry. So coming back to your question, it depends on you; if you really want MBBS then take a year drop and study for it. Otherwise you can choose BDS. BDS isn't bad or inferior to MBBS if you're wondering about that. You study the same subjects as a MBBS student does, in addition to your dental subjects. BDS is an already specialised branch and you can open your own clinic after graduation or may study for pg. I don't mean to undermine any profession but it's obvious that you can't practice as a general physician in case of just MBBS (you can actually but you wouldn't want to). People look for a specialist most of the times. In case of a BDS grad, you can call in a specialist. At the end of the day, it's your call. Think clearly what you exactly want to do few years later and choose wisely. All the best! Ps- Sketch your future but with a pencil.

Lots of bass and baritone singers have been discovered and signed. Baritones get discovered today, too. The genre bringing the most baritone singers into the limelight today is Country music. T.J. Osborne - Brothers Osborne Chris Young Trace Adkins Josh Turner However, you can find examples pretty well everywhere: Chris Cornell (R.I.P.) - Audioslave, Soundgarden Michael Buble John Lennon - The Beatles Jimi Hendrix Trent Reznor - Nine Inch Nails While it is definitely harder as a baritone in today’s climate, some of the most iconic singers in modern music have been, and continue to be baritones. Do women prefer low or high male singing voices? What famous male singers have low voices? Is a high male voice a sign of low testosterone levels? If I work hard and have passion can I become a singer even if I have a low voice for a girl? I love singing? Does singing in a pitch that is not similar to your speaking voice make you a bad singer? I'll work on the assumption that the question refers to being discovered in the pop culture sense. Yes, it is possible. People have varying tastes in music and you can find just about anything in the Internet so it shouldn't really be a question of possibility but that of probability. While I do admit that there are very few people who get discovered because of their low singing voices despite the connotation that low and deep voices are “sexy” is due to many factors. One of which is that people with low singing voices shine the brightest in groups so they are not that known to most people. (my personal opinion) I'll mention some examples that I can see in recent years. The first of which is Avi Kaplan who became famous because of his involvement as part of the a capella YouTube sensation that is Pentatonix. The group rose to prominence after winning the third season of The Sing-off. Scotty McCreery is someone who I'll mention as well. He won the tenth season of American Idol. Whole the push of country music fans may have contributed to his success. He is an example I'd put out there who isn't famous because of a group. Maybe joining singing competitions help, I guess.

The basic technique for chowder is this: Chop and sweat onions and some finely chopped celery in butter, a neutral flavor oil (eg canola, not olive oil), or traditionally in rendered salt pork. If not using salt pork, add some salt Add diced potatoes in a half seafood broth/half milk cooking liquid and simmer (do not boil!) When the potatoes are nearly cooked, but not completely, add the seafood (whatever combination you like) and simmer until the seafood is done. You might add just a little bit of thyme for flavor and maybe a little pinch of paprika for color, and lots of black pepper for sure Some options include these: For a low fat version, use canola oil, and low- or no-fat milk For a richer version, use full fat milk or even cream (if using cream use less than you would milk) or add a little butter to the milk For the seafood broth: Buy a whole fish, fillet it, and use the bones to make stock Traditional fish markets sell fish heads, sometimes even calling them chowders Use the liquid in the canned clams can Use clam broth you can buy by the bottle Use clam base, available at Costco or stores that supply restaurants/caterers Chowder always tastes better the 2nd day. So make enough to have leftovers for tomorrow. Note that nowhere did I mention flour or any other thickener. The broth should itself be thin, but the chowder thick with potatoes, onions, and seafood. What is the best way to make fried shrimp? After I buy a live lobster, how can I make it last as long as possible, and how many hours would that be? How do you make Hibachi chicken and shrimp? How do you cook frozen lobster claws? How do you make an origami lobster? Is there a certain method to use? I would not make a shrimp and lobster chowder. Both seafoods are incredibly delicious. My preference would be to make one or the other separately. I'm not saying it's bad or wrong- I just like to get the full flavor of either the lobster or the shrimp/prawns.
There is no special reason for most animals having 5 fingers. if it had been 6 fingers, still the question would be raised why 6 fingers? But the design of thumb is special which helps in having better hold of object.
“At the moment” means “right now.” “In the moment”, refers to a state of mind in which someone is totally focused on that instant in time. Nothing else exists for him. Whatever he is doing, he is totally into it. He is “living in that moment” The first phrase is a general prepositional modifier. You would not use the second phrase to modify anything but a person`s state of mind. “At the moment, John is playing violin.” (he is playing now) “While playing violin, John is completely in the moment.” (everything else fades from his awareness other than the immediate joy of playing” What is the difference between has and had? What is the difference between Form S-1 and S-3? What is the difference between the U.S. and USA? When someone caused a lot of trouble and said he did all to help me, can I say, "How do you help me?" to mean "You're not helping me at all"? What's the difference between s & 's at the end of a word? “At the moment” is a straight forward literal statement of time. At the moment, I am typing a response to a question. Right now. This time. “In the moment” is an idiom. It is a figurative statement meaning, I am absorbed by what I am doing right now. I am not concerned about the past nor am I worried about the future. I know I have things to do, but right now I am not thinking about anything other than answering a question. I am “in the moment.”
Hello Everyone, Thanks for A2A. Yes, This year's cut-off should be a little high because the paper was too easy. Since the seats are only 60 and almost 15,000 students appeared for BLAT 2017. Hence there are complete chances that Cut-off will be High. Now talking about the numbers, Past two year's cut off was approx 300 marks for General. Although paper of past 2 years were not this simple as this year's. Hence I think this year it may cross even 320–330 (For General). F.Y.I. The seats for General category is not 60, I ts 28 . Remaining seats are reserved for SCs, STs and OBCs. P.s. - This is not exact Cut-off. I am even not the correct person to answer this question, cause I appeared for BLAT 2 years ago hence i dont have much idea about this exam now. What should I expect the cutoff to be for the BA (Hons.) Arts Exam 2017 for BHU Hostel? What would be a safe score for English Hons.? Is the BHU entrance exam for a BA LLB, hard? What is the expected cutoff of the BHU chemistry entrance exam? What will be the expected cutoff marks for the BHU UET BA LLB 2017? What will be the expected cutoff for M.Com BHU 2017? I've taken  BLAT 2017 . BLAT's difficulty level was below expectations. Paper was quite  easy  (or many questions were quite easy) but it may lead to  higher cut offs.   In 2016, BLAT paper was kind of different. In 2016,  Idioms & phrases & one word substitution  were introduced in BLAT while BLAT 2014 & 2015 lack it.   Although, 2016 paper was  relatively harder  that that of 2017 (especially  Maths  section) but this year Maths, GK etc were easy.   Last year cut offs  were    General:- 276 OBC:- 236 SC:- 162 ST:- 87   So there might be a slight increase in cut offs. As per my prediction  (I may be wrong too) ,  CLAT 2017 's cut offs will be around:-   General:- 300+  OBC:- 275+ SC:- 190+  ST:- 110+    PS:- As per answers checked by me through internet and calculator, my score is around 180 & still 44 questions still left to be checked.    Extremely low chances to get BHU. What's your expected score?
As for the tan - use peelings once a week and rub the most tan places more thoroughly than all the others. You should also use strong sunblock (SPF 50 and higher) on those darker areas leaving the rest of the skin unprotected for a couple of weeks - apply the sunblok every day, even on cloudy days. And find at least one day to lay in the sun for a couple of hour in the afternoon wearing strong sunblok only on already very tan places so that the rest of the skin gets darker and evens out the differences. As for the legs - shave them, that’s the only painfree option for hair removal. And don’t forget to apply body lotion after shaving to prevent skin irritation and dryness. Eyebrows: watch some youtube videos on the subject, there are many there that explain how to do it yourself, if you spend enough time searching zou will find the one that answers all zour questions. Hair: to keep dandruff under control you need to use a special shampoo, you’d better go to a drug store and get one there, the ones you can get at a supermarket are mostly designed for very mild cases. You should also change your pillocases once a week and wash them at 90 degrees Celsius to kill all the fungus off, wash your hairbrush several times a week with hot water and anti-dandruff shampoo. Once you have defeated dandruff your hair will probably stop falling out so much, but in case it doesn’t try cleaning up your diet, taking supplements with vitamins A ans E and Calcium and try some hair masks to strengthen the hair roots, you can even make some yourself - the internet is full of recipes, the ones I found the most effective contain colourless henna powder, milk and raw eggs. As for the pimples try special facials with salt and mud once a week, use special day and night creams that are supposed to lessen acne, and if ill this doesn’t help and acne gets really bad, go to your OBGYN and get a prescription for a birth control pill - those pills, especially the ones containing the hormone cyproteronacetate, clean up the skin better than anything else, because if creams and masks don’t work the cause of your acne is most likely hormonal and there is no other way of balancing your hormones than to take artificial ones. How do I make my skin glow without going to a beauty parlour? Do women really care about skin color when it comes to male beauty? What are the best home skin care remedies? Who can help me restore my lips to their natural color, a doctor or beauty/skin care dermatologist? Where do I go for skin care in Dubai? Use sunblock. It will help. Buy a tweezers, tweeze from underneath. Go to the drugstore and buy a regimen suitable for your skin type. Buy a razor and shave your legs. Buy Head & Shoulders shampoo for your dandruff. Losing hair is genetic. A dermatologist has effective medication for that. No home remedies encourage new growth or stop hair loss. It’s possible that it’s an endocrine issue. For hairy legs use Razor or any shaving tool with a good shower gel. For eyebrows you need to use a plucking tool . You can refer to youtube .Millions of videos are there. Use egg white . Apply it directly on the affected area and leave it till it gets dry. Peel it of . The black dots will be removed along with that. Use Himalaya fairness face wash daily twice or thrice a day. You can use some home made face packs to get a fairer/less tanned skin tone. 1. Curd and honey. 2. Curd and oatmeal. 3. Lemon juice and gram flour /Oatmeal. 4. Tomato paste and lemon juice/rose water. 5. Baking soda and white vinegar. You need to take 1 table spoon of each ingredients for each pack and need to mix and apply on your face. Leave it for 15- 20 minutes or till it gets dried and wash it off with cold water. Do it daily. For dandruff use Head and Shoulders shampoo everyday .Even I used that and it actually works. Now its completely gone. Drink plenty of water. You can use the mixture of Aloevera gel and curd on your scalp. If you want to regrow your hair you have to use castor oil .Only castor oil can regrow hair. Eat a lot of carrots ,leafy vegetables and sprouts. Eat eggs and nuts/almonds .These helps to maintain healthy hair. Use the mixture of castor oil, olive oil and vitamin E capsule every night while going to bed. Make it lukewarm and Apply only on scalp with a cotton ball. Massage it gently. This will keep you calm and relaxed and help to increase blood circulation. Leave it overnight and wash your hair in the morning. Follow it for a month. You will regain your hair. hope that helps.
Well just after the verdict was announced pakistanis on twitter started #PakistanRejectsICJ. This itself shows the true behaviour of Pakistanis. Even after the verdict from a “World Court” , they are still ranting that they will hang Kulbhushan Jadhav. Pakistan can never be trusted. They are so shameless that they might ignore the verdict and hang Jadhav. If they hang Kulbhushan Jadhav, then at the best they will face “International Embarrassment”. Then the only option left with India will be to go to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Even then the problem might be with China, as a member of UNSC, China can veto the case in favour of Pakistan. For now lets just hope that Pakistan dosen’t go against the verdict and hang Kulbhushan Jadhav. If everything goes by law then in no time Kulbhushan Jadhav will be back in India. Lets also thank our government, specially Sushma Swaraj and also Harish Salve. Do Pakistanis still see India as a threat? Why did a large number of Muslims decide to stay in India after partition in 1947? Pakistan sentences alleged Indian RAW agent Kulbhushan Jadhav to death. Was there any concrete evidence against him for espionage against Paki... Why does Pakistanis not join India? Since our two nation theory has failed & Pakistan is now a failed state and a threat to global security an... What was the Dabhol case at the ICJ that India lost to Enron ? Pakistan is struggling to balance her national and international forces. Both pulling the nation in opposite directions. National politics demands hardcore and support for fundamentalists whereas the international pressure today is anti to these. China is en-cashing the situation and grabbing as much as she can from Pakistan. To the extent China has put her own credibility at UN at stake by using Veto in favour of terrorism against India to support Pakistan. Elected Govt in Pakistan has the least authority in comparison to her Military, ISI and fundamentalists turned terror organisations. In the case of Jadhav The Pakistan Govt will put everything to seek his execution and to withhold the sentence of the Military Court. Thus Military authorities in Pakistan will save their reputation in the eyes of the public for a sentence they all know was manipulated and vicious. China will now try to seek Indian favour for his project by trade off in Jadhav case where it may ask Pakistan Military to give up its demand of executing Jadhav. India should resist that. Pakistan and China will both burn their fingers at the International arena. Pakistan as rogue nation and China as her friend and gloves in hand.

Well, Dav is one of the best colleges in Chandigarh. Good college life, hostel or pg life, cafes and canteen. Being a DAvian myself we miss a lot about this college like the dosa of Coffee house, the kulche and juice at the gate of college and nescafe. So basically you will enjoy your time there. But there is a caution like you may not find an academically inclined environment here. You know like everybody wants to bunk the classes, timings will be like 8 to 2, and all the fun and frolic. So you have to be cautious you know, to concentrate on your studies. For a girl I would suggest to go for MCM DAV instead that is a much better option. Faculty, lab work, timings, discipline and extracurricular activities in every aspect MCM is better. I hope this helps. All the best.
Thanks for the A2A. It’s hard to give very specific advice as I don’t know the rest of your circumstances, but here are a few things to think about: Focus on the long-term, for reasons that I elaborate on in   How and Why to Be a Long-Term Investor Most people do better with a passive investing approach. Vanguard is one of the most aligned and credible providers - check out this section of their site:  How to invest | Vanguard I would suggest reading these two books. They are written by very credible people and will give you a good perspective on how to think about investing (and how to stay out of trouble!): I'm $80,000 in debt and am about receive $50,000 inheritance. How should I proceed? I just inherited $38,000. I would like to use $20,000 of it to invest, but I have no experience and no clue. How can I make that 20k work best... If I Inherited $3,250,000 what will be the best way to invest that money so I can live off it yearly? I have $82,000 of student loan debt and am due to receive an inheritance of $90,000 in the next few months. What's the best way to make the mo... I'm about to inherit $65,000. How can I invest it now to have the best chance of being able to pay for my mother's living expenses in 10 years... In contradiction to other answers the question of taking out a loan to leverage property investments is sound if applied reasonably and you’re right that in your circumstances you may not be able to do that unless your property produces sufficient cash-flow to service the debt and an appropriate buffer. Also be aware that leverage makes your equity riskier and given you’re 18 you may not be in a position to properly judge the risk. Finally also consider that property is a pretty illiquid asset class. If you however believe, property is the asset class for you, you could look for an appropriate collective investment scheme, be it a REIT, some sort of real estate fund or whatever (depending on where you are). These will also apply leverage, but the upside is you won’t be personally liable and your investment will be professionally managed. The downside is however that this is not free and the administration cost of a vehicle like that will eat into your returns. I have just received an inheritance of 80,000. How should I best handle it? I am only 18 and would like to invest in property eventually, but it’s not likely a bank would give a full time student (with no full time work) a loan. I think this is an amazing opportunity I have been given and I want to ensure I deal with it somewhat successfully (to what definition, who knows) It’s an opportunity, but a double-edged sword of an opportunity. I assume we’re talking about $80,000 dollars, yes? Jobst has a sound recommendation. You can open a TD Ameritrade account, fund it with the inheritance, then invest some of it in REIT’s, such as NLY, or MAIN. These can pay you 10% interest annually, and on $40K that’s $4000/yr. Sweet! Also, you can set up an IRA toward future retirement, fund it up to $5000 per year, and grow the nest-egg tax-free. It can also save you on taxes if you have sufficient income. Some of the money can be used to pay down debt as well. And yes, you could gamble it on a larger loan and hope that you can turn a profit, but…that can be a painful learning experience. Better to start small. And remember, Don’t risk what you can’t afford to lose! Cheers. 80000 is a good amount to save for.Since you are only 18, open a ppf account & deposit 80000 there. Yearly put 500Rs into it until you start working. Once you start working save more.When you are about 30 yrs & earn sufficient to get a loan or withdraw half of this ppf amount & invest in a property.
Sleepovers, rather than being phased out completely, generally just  change  a little bit as a person ages. At 9 years old , I’d have a sleepover for a birthday party. At 13 years old , I’d have a sleepover so that I could stay up late with a friend watching movies and eating way too many sweets. At 18 years old , I’d have a sleepover for convenience. So, if I went to visit a friend who lived a while away, or if we’d planned to spend two days together anyway (i.e. over a weekend) and we may as well just sleep over at the other’s house. Maybe we’re going somewhere early the next morning (the airport, or some trip), and it’s just going to be easier for us both to be more organised if we set off from the same spot. Maybe it’s because we’re having a house party, and we’d rather just drunkenly crash right where we are at 3am, rather than navigate public transport home at midnight (my 24 year old brother did this recently!). My point is this: I wouldn’t, at the age of 23 as I am now, have a birthday sleepover of eating pizza and having manicures. I probably wouldn’t have a sleepover staying up late watching movies and such as I used to when I was 13 either, unless again it’s a friend who lives a while away whom I don’t get to see often. This all shows how sleepovers have changed, with age; it’s not a ‘sleepover’, necessarily. It’s sleeping over. Perfectly fine at any age. Why are teens over 16 (mainly boys) ok with online pics? My 17-year-old son wants to have a sleepover with his girlfriend. Is this normal, and what should I do? Is the movie G.B.F. ok for teens to watch? Is it ok to date 19 years old girl? I'm 24. I'm 16. Am I in my early teens, mid-teens, or late teens? Well I think first of all you are old enough to decide yourself, and your parents should respect that. They should be glad you are not getting drunk at some dubios place like other people your age do. That being said, you can have sleepovers at any age. I think its not too unusual to stay with a friend e.g. after a party when it’s to late.  And a ‘regular’ sleepover? Why not? I don’t see any point why one should be too old for that. I would understand if people said it was a “girls thing”, but even then, don’t let others influence you and do what YOU want! I am almost sixteen and my best friend is a year younger than me. We both recently moved, but before that, we were so close that we would sleep over usually at least once a week. During the summer we slept over every day (we were both moving soon and wanted to make the most of our time). I don’t think there is any age where you are too old. My brother is three years older than me and he has either large groups of friends sleep over or just one person sleep over frequently, no big deal. We used to go out on weekends a lot and play ultimate frisbee and eat out and just crash at someone’s house. My best friend and I would mainly actually sleep outside (hammocks or a tent depending on the mood) but we would also sleep inside and just play games, pull an all nighter, or talk. It’s a great way to get closer together. This year, I’ve already had a few sleepovers, a few group ones and a few just me and one other person. Sometimes sleepovers are better simply for convenience, you wouldn’t have to drive all the way back home or anything. In my opinion, there isn’t an age limit on sleepovers and you should enjoy doing what you want to do. If your parents trust you to make the right decisions, then they should let you, age is irrelevant. You’re not too old for a sleepover, you’re only 17. Teenagers have sleepovers all the time and it’s a shame for people to take something you like out of your life. Maturity is a made-up concept that means different things to everyone, so I think that your parents might be worried about something else and not that you’re too old. Try talking to them. Yeah, that’s a little off. I would not.
This is all depends on your real interests. But, Let me clear one thing. If you are just want to go for Job then just B-tech is ok. But if you are looking to be an entrepreneur then you should go for Masters in finance. Hope this answer solved your query Thanks

VY Canis Majoris is approximately 1420 R☉ (± 120 R☉, but for the sake of simplicity, let’s disregard that). In other words, it has a diameter of 1.9758 × 10 [math]^{9}[/math]  km. In comparison, Earth has a diameter of 12,742 km. If 1.9758 × 10 [math]^{9}[/math]  km equals 12,742 km, then 12,742 km is: 12,742 × 12,742 / 1.9758 × 10 [math]^{9}[/math]  = 0.08217 km, or 82.17 m. Here is an image I created to compare VY Canis Majoris with Earth, using the Sun as a bridge to compare the two. Of course, the scale of VY Canis Majoris and Earth don’t matter when it comes to a size comparison. Image: Copyright © 2017 Martin Silvertant. All Rights Reserved. Also, if VY Canis Majoris has a diameter of 12,742 km and Earth has a diameter of 82.17 m, then the Sun has a diameter of 8.97 km. Is vy canis majoris visible from earth? Earth is now the size of UY Scuti. How long does it take to explore this new Earth? Is VY Canis Majoris the second largest star? What would happen if VY Canis Majoris were as dense as our Sun? How big would VY Canis Majoris look if you could appear next to it in person? Radius of VY Canis Majoris:  [math]988.3 \text{ million km}= 988.3 \times 10^6 \text{ km} \approx 10^9 \text{ km}[/math] . Radius of Earth:  [math]6,400 \text{ km}[/math] . It can be inferred that the radius of VY Canis Majoris would have to reduce approximately  [math]80,000[/math]  times in order to be the same size as Earth. So, if Earth’s radius were to reduce  [math]80,000[/math]  times, it would have a radius of  [math]82[/math] [math] \text{ meters}[/math] . Okay, enough math. Here’s an image to illustrate the size of the Sun and VY Canis Majoris. Image Source: By Oona Räisänen - Self-made in Inkscape., Public Domain,  File:Sun and VY Canis Majoris.svg Here’s an info-graphic—although it is not scaled to a significant accuracy. Horrifying. VY Canis Majoris is estimated to be roughly 1400 times the diameter of the sun. The sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth. This makes VY Canis Majoris’s diameter roughly 150,000 times that of Earth. The Earth’s diameter is 12,750 km, give or take a few. If VY Canis Majoris were shrunk down to the size of Earth and the Earth were shrunk proportionally the Earth would be 12,750 / 150,000 km or 0.085 km across. That’s 85 meters or a bit smaller than a  football field  (or football pitch, if you prefer.) VY Canis Majoris is  huge  but consider however that it is only around 17 times as massive as the sun (give or take a few.) Spread that amount of mass, over a volume of space that is 1400^3 times larger, and you have an average density that is, at most, only around 10 miligrams per cubic meter. That’s about 1/100th the weight of a paperclip- spread out over a cubic meter. The density of Earth’s atmosphere at sea level is around 120,000 times greater. VY Canis Majoris is a monstrously huge, glowing ball of  fluff.
Machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, radios, night vision equipment. Logistical support of all kinds (the four B’s, as they say: bullets, boots, beans, and batteries). Camping gear. Field medical gear, plasma, drugs, and so on. Vehicles, maybe even armored. Recon drones. What is the best kind of knife to use as self-defense?

No guns. What's the law in 2016 for self-defense in Ohio? Soldiers (Regulars, Reserves, National Guard, militia) all need essentially the same things. They need food, shelter, weapons. This is going mean MREs or dried foods, canteens and some form of water, a first aid kit, a flash light, pocket knife, mess kit, matches/lighter, cup, clothing repair kit, soap, toilet paper. They need shelter, a tent, ground pad or cloth, and sleeping bag. They need some form of camouflage pants, shirt, jacket, underwear, socks, hat, rain poncho, coat, and boots, They need to be able to fight, which will mean a rifle, of some sort, that is reasonably military grade such as: an SKS, AK 47 type, M1 rifle, M1a (M14), Mini-14/30, AR15/M4/M16 type rifle, or at least a good military bolt action like a 1903 Springfield or Moisin-Nagant with several magazines/mag pouches. A solid combat knife is important like a Kbar fighting knife. A good handgun in 9mm or 45 acp is going to be helpful like a 1911 Colt, M9 Beretta, of Glock 17. These would all be helpful for citizen soldiers. Kind of funny, I’m one of three captains in a militia! Surplus Equipment. Depends on what you mean. For example: I myself have a Type 56 SKS, a surplus Chinese paratrooper’s rifle. I also have a Colt 1911 Series ‘70. (It wasn’t really surplus, but 1911s are often considered surplus, I believe, since the military switched to the M92FS in the nineties.) One of the other captains has a real Russian military surplus AK47 (It is an original!!) with a bayonet and a 75 round drum (Take that, Libtards!!). The third captain has an old Winchester shotgun, Gods only know if it was used by the military or not, but the military did use Winchesters at one point. Now, if I wanted a standard issue surplus weapon for all of us, I would want four things. One: Marine Corps surplus M16A4s (Not sure those are surplus yet, but they will be soon. Either way, I’d customize mine to look like one from Vietnam.) Two: Russian Army surplus AK47Ms Three: US Army surplus M24A3s Four: US Army surplus M92FS (Since they’re switching to the P320) Really depends on what you mean by militia. I mean, the British TA is a militia of sorts in that it is voluntary and part time, but it gets the best equipment available as and when it comes, and I held to a high standard-not quite the equal of the regulars, but not that far off as an infantry force, so it isn't really all that distinguishable from the rest of the British Army.
Problem with that is the prebuilt PC’s don’t typically have the PSU (Power Supply Units) of sufficient strength for gaming graphics. For a GTX 1070 it needs a PSU of 450~500 Watts  power supply unit. For an 8300 it’s typically used a 240–320 Watt PSU. Honestly you’d be better off looking for a Gamer selling his old box for a new Ryzen/Kabby Lake system. Check Ebay, etc. You’d probably want an i7–2600k, i7–3770k, i7–4770k,i7- 4790k, but depending on type you may have to go with an X99 board for 6–10 core CPU’s with 28–44 PCIe 3.0 lanes (for Multi-GPU effectiveness) Those would be the i7–5820k, 5930k anything more would probably be out of your price range.

A pcie gen 2.0 slot should not be a bottleneck for a GTX 1070. What will be a bottleneck is the RAM. 4GB will not cut it anymore for machine learning/deep learning, specially with any decent size data set. You should atleast be looking at 16GB RAM. 128GB should be enough for a primary drive but consider getting a 1–2TB hard disk to go along with the SSD. If deep learning is your primary goal and not gaming and you are a beginner at it then a 1070 is bit of an overkill.
The common problem is people who doesn’t know even the basics of marketing are anticipating and dictating an expert what to do :P People look so funny with this kind of attitude.. What are some of your "first world problems"? What are common problems with BMW M5? What are the common car problems? What is the most common problem? What are common market research methods?

I work in Business Development + Operations right now so I generally check basic sales metrics and operational ones (cancellations, fulfillment rate, pending orders, return rates, TAT of processing). I think some key metrics in marketing is important to check as well, including spend, cac, cpo, etc. Turning a profit is always a challenge in online retail so looking at sales and your p&l is also quite important. Likewise, your role in the company would probably affect the granular details you may need/want to focus on.

As far as your “typing” and “language” skills are fine, it is better to go with a template. I say this because, if you just type and follow simple heading styles with a good enough language, your resume content might be good, but it will be bland. It will not be appealing to a person hiring because they do not have much time to FIND the REQUIRED EXPERIENCE in your simple formatted resume. So, it is advisable to follow a pre-formatted version and edit relevant details to just complete and present your skills in a best way possible. You may simply do a google search for  free resume templates  and find basic formats that are more than enough for any general application. But if you are a specialist at a particular field and need to highlight the particular fields to get hired, you search for precisely resume format for the position you are looking to apply for. For example,  resume template for mechanical engineer  is what I would search for, me being a mechanical engineer. Then, secondly you may go for services who specialize at resume writing, such as  The Most Intuitive Résumé Builder | Novorésumé You just need to select your experience level and fill in details, save the pdf. I will give you a secret recipe that I’m trying on right now. If you are sending a pdf resume in email, get the shortest possible version using  The Most Intuitive Résumé Builder | Novorésumé  , because the person looking at it is probably just looking to filter applications based on field of work or years of experience or a particular software experience that they use. So just create a basic resume using the website and forward it to them. It should be enough to get you shortlisted. Now comes the tricky part. Just dump this format and focus on your word format. Type it, correct it, give it all the details that should sketch a complete path of your career, your requirement of the job, what they get when they hire you, etc. So eventually, yes you should go for a word format in resume, and fill in all details. You can always modify it to look different from the standard format, but as far as my experience goes it will matter least for the decision of you getting hired. If you are looking for a job, all the best! Which words should I use in My CV to make it good? How do I make a CV? What are good ways to write a CV in French? I need some CV templates for making a good-looking CV to apply in the US. Where can I find it? Researchers - Is it better to send your CV in PDF or MS Word? I don’t think template is important factor in recruiters and hiring manager’s decision making. You should not worry about CV/Resume template because recruiters and hiring manager give zero marks to it. In fact, they hate it. Never spend a dime and time on it. I want you to have a content ready so you will have timeless resume whenever you need. Create a master file for resume. Put all your educations, experiences, training details. For every experience you write what you did best, changes you made and recognized by others, increase or decrease in results, outputs. Quantify it. Put others comments on your work. List your achievements, awards, prizes. List references. Keep it updated regularly. I always create “You are The Best” story to interest recruiters and hiring managers. You need a customized approach so forget templates. You can write a cv/resume in 15 minutes with info you have and it will be your timeless resume customized to the job you apply.

“Strong and Stable leadership!” No. But in all seriousness, if you were to present party policies to the vast majority of the country; without labelling which party they belong to, then I’d be surprised if the conservatives even got 10% of the support. Okay, maybe a bit more than that, but it’s important to understand that the attraction that comes with the Conservative party actually has a lot to do with their name. Conservative: i.e. to conserve the status quo. The country is filled with many, many issues right now and currently at the risk of going off a cliff. The reason why the Conservative party are doing so well is for many reasons: They project themselves as strong, and stable. Their strong and stable appearance has worked well because the far-right media has done well to work for their political buddies who are currently in power; by keeping out any competition. There is a clear disparity between the younger audience and the older; in the way that they consume the news. Hence why older people tend to be a lot more conservative; they watch a lot more mainstream media. This, combined with younger voters being apathetic is why the conservatives have such a strong lead. The conservative values are not what a lot of the people of the UK tend to share; but rather that the opposition is that heavily outgunned politically that they often get no coverage what so ever. Labour wants to get rid of university tuition fees; the Conservatives wish to bring back fox hunting and end school meals for poor kids. In the U.K., do they register for a party to vote? Is the American Republican Party more or less conservative than the UK Conservative Party? In the UK election, why didn't the Conservative party promise to stay in the EU? They could easily win and it would probably be better for Bri... What is a conservative party in India? Are UK ambassadors members of conservative party? The Conservatives appeal on several levels. I would say that they have a work ethic and libertarian streak that many citizens approve of. The Party itself has always been more fragmented than, say, Labour. Labour has always had a strong central core, believing in central, top-down government. Control has, after all, been the guiding principle of Socialist governments, whether it is control of energy, production, food supply or any other issue. The Conservatives always used to have utterly independent local parties that were loosely bound to a central office, but that central office could not impose, say, candidates for the constituencies without the agreement of the local members. That meant that when a Conservative MP was elected, he or she would be more likely to listen to the voices of local members and constituents. However, the appeal right now is much more due to the position of the nation with the EU. Since Brexit will entail a lot of hard bargaining, the nation needs a strong leader. It is clear from polling results that the majority of the nation believes that Mrs May has a better chance of negotiating than the leaders of any of the other parties. Not much, rich definitely get richer and pay less, poor get poorer and pay more, everything gets privatised and working class items get taxed more and more every year. They are warsome, power hungry classists that rely on taxong the little man to pay for the big, hence the name! They keep the legalised extortion of higher rate taxation to a minimum whilst still running a reasonably ethical society. They’re centrist. And that’s what we Brits like. It’s how Blair got the Labour Party into power for a while - going centrist. When the Tories head to the right they get voted out. When Labour lurch to the left they get voted out. Balance things and that’s what Brits will go for every time.
I'm 6′2″, both my parents are 5′9″. My brother and sister are also shorter than me. However my grandpa is like 6′4″, so I may get my genes from him. Point is, what genes you get is unpredictable and how tall your parents are will not necessarily give you an indication of how tall you will eventually become. For you,being 15, sounds like you hit your growth spurt early. You may keep growing, maybe you are done. Nobody can tell. Just see what happens. When I was in middle school, i was the short kid in class. Once I hit puberty at around your age, I grew. When I was 19, I was 5′11″, and still growing (late bloomer). Now I'm 6′2″. Genetics are crazy :) How tall can I grow to be? My dad is 5'9", and my mom is 5'4″, and I'm 5′7″ at age 15. Will I break 6 feet? I am 16 years old boy and 5'8" tall. Father's height is 5'10" and mother is 5'4" tall. How tall would I be? I'm 5'8 and 14 male. My mom is 5′6 and my dad is 5′10. How tall will I be? I'm male and I'm 5'6 at 15 years old. My dad is 6'1 and my mom is 5'7. How tall should I get? I'm 14, 5'11", and 150lb. My dad is 6'1" and my mom is 5'8". How tall could I become? I have no idea. Genes are unpredictable. You where lucky to make 5' 8".You might gain another inch.
Yes, I have seen this movie and that too twice. I found this movie awesome, an excellent creation of Director SS Rajamouli. The beauty of the movie lies in the spectacular way the story is told. Yes, Rajamouli has knocked it out of the square yet again. If ‘The Beginning’ gave you the glimpse of Mahishmathi- the kingdom, the second part focuses more on exploring the soul of its characters. Also, how the clash of principles can lead to some devastating results and shatter down of such a grand kingdom. Every expression of characters in the movie, even if it’s a tear drop or a genuine smile is highlighted very smartly to catch hold of the sight of every viewer. The camera work is tremendous which uses every still in the scenes astutely to make you sympathize with the characters even more. Still, there are some people who have not watched this movie yet. For them the complete review is here. (Baahubali 2- The Conclusion) Full Movie Review 2017: Purely Magical Leaving you with WOW Thanks. Did you like the Baahubali 2 trailer? Bahubali 2 was a disappointment. Am I alone to think so? How many stars were given for Bahubali 2? Which movie is better: “Baahubali 2” or “Dangal”? Who is the director of the movie Baahubali 2? yes, nice movie taking indian cinema to the world.also it have all masala of indian cinema that we indians want to see like action comedy romance drama and music all at the same time at one place and in one movie. It is perfect entertainer and also awesome actors superb vfx. All in all its a five star rated from me(personal opinion) .And bigest money maker giant of indian cinema. Yes. The much anticipated movie of the year. Why kattapa killed bahubali was the sole reason which forced a majority to watch that film. But after watching the film i would definitely say that it is not a big reason.The film is simply superb when it is viewed in the aspect of the storyline and vfx. But some of the fight sequences remained awkward!.It is my personal opinion. yes it is a must watch in a theatre!!! For d effects and sound!! No, haven’t watched both parts. The reason is I’m not great lover of VFX movies. Even both parts are applauded from critics and audience.
Okay, so I watched your video about condoms (Don’t Ask) and… Well, it’s pretty great! I only recommend adding some text explaining what you are making, as well as maybe a counter in the corner. What are some amazing facts about YouTube? I do not want to do a YouTube channel but I want to share advice, tips, life hacks and storytimes. Where can I do this other than on YouTube? Can you give me some advice on how to grow my YouTube channel? How do I get a hacked YouTube channel back? What's the best YouTube channels for dating advice? Check out my video out that I uploaded recently. You can leave positive comments or constructive criticism if I need to improve anything. I would appreciate it very much :)
Not who, what. The light of the world, God, is not a person, not something to be anthropomorphized. Beyond human, perhaps without consciousness, the “ Élan vital ” that makes the world hum. Do we light up the world? Why there is nothing 100% in world? 100% resistor . 100% black matter (absorb100% light) ... Which is the world's oldest religion? What is the evidence of it? Do we really live in an absurd world? Will Islam eventually die? Literally, the Sun, spiritually, the Son. Gareth's wordplay of the day - check! Years ago I was lead to believe that to practice Nichiren’s Buddhism correctly, one had to attend meetings and belong to an organisation. Nowadays I’ve come to understand that anyone, regardless of whether they become a ‘member’ of a group or not, can benefit from their own personal practice. The reason for this is that the Law of myoho-renge-kyo represents the identity of what some now refer to as the ‘unified field of all consciousnesses’. In other words, it’s the essence behind all existence and non-existence, the ultimate creative force behind planets, stars, nebulae, people, animals, trees, fish, birds and all phenomena, manifest or latent. All matter and intelligence is simply waves or ripples manifesting to and from this core source. Consciousness (enlightenment) is itself the true creator of everything that is, ever was and ever will be, right down to the minutest particles of dust, each being an individual ripple or wave. The big difference between chanting ‘Nam-myoho-renge-kyo’ Nam = to awaken and align with one's inner-self) and most conventional prayers is that instead of depending on a middle man to connect us to our state of enlightenment, we’re able to do it ourselves by tapping directly into it by way of self-produced sound vibration. On the subject of ‘what or who is God?’, when we compare the concept of ‘God’, as a separate entity that is forever watching down on us, to Nichiren’s teachings, the true omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence of what most people call ‘God’ is our enlightenment, which exists nowhere else but within us. When the disciples asked Jesus where the Kingdom of God is, didn’t he tell them that it was within them? Some say that ‘God’ is an entity that can never be seen. I think that the vast amount of information that is constantly being conveyed via electromagnetic waves gives us proof of how an invisible state of what many call ‘God’ could actually exist. It’s widely known that certain data being relayed by way of electromagnetic waves has the potential to help bring about extraordinary and powerful effects, including instant global awareness of something or mass emotional reaction. As well as many other things, it’s also common knowledge that these waves can be used to detonate a bomb or to even enable NASA to control the movements of a robot as far away as the Moon or Mars. However, none of this is possible without a receiver to decode the information that is being transmitted. Without the receiver, the information would remain impotent. In a similar way, it’s very important for us to have our receiver switched on, so that we can activate a clear and precise understanding of our life, all other life and who we and all else that exists truly is. Chanting ‘Nam-myoho-renge-kyo’ helps us to achieve this, because it allows us to reach into the core of our enlightenment and switch it on. That’s because, as I mentioned before, the sound vibration of ‘myoho-renge-kyo’ represents the combination of the three major laws that underlie all existence. ‘Myoho’ represents the Law of latency and manifestation (Nature), and consists of two alternating states. One state of ‘myo’ is where everything in life that’s not obvious to us exists. This includes our stored memories when we’re not thinking about them, our hidden potential and inner emotions whenever they’re not being expressed, our desires, our fears, our wisdom, happiness, karma, and more importantly, our enlightenment. The other state, ‘ho’, is where everything in Life exists whenever it becomes obvious to us, such as when a thought pops up from our memory, whenever we experience or express our emotions, or whenever a good or bad effect comes forth from our karma. When anything becomes apparent, it simply means that it has come out of the state of ‘myo’ (dormancy/latency) and into a state of ‘ho’ (manifestation). It’s the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, being awake or asleep, or knowing and not knowing something. The second law, ‘renge’, governs and controls the functions of ‘myoho’ – ‘ren’ meaning cause and ‘ge’ meaning effect. These two laws, ‘myoho’ and ‘renge’, work together simultaneously and underlie all spiritual and physical existence. The final and third part of the tri-combination, ‘kyo’, is what allows the law ‘myoho’ to integrate with the law ‘renge’. It’s the great, invisible thread of energy that fuses and connects together all Life and matter, as well as the past, present and future. It is often termed the Universal Law of Communication. Perhaps it could even be compared to the ‘string theory’ that some scientists now suspect exists. Just as our body cells, thoughts, feelings and all else are constantly fluctuating within us, everything in the world around us and beyond is also in a constant state of flux, in accordance with these three laws. In fact, more things are going back and forth between the two states of ‘myo’ and ‘ho’ in a single moment than it would ever be possible for us to calculate or describe. And it doesn't matter how big, small, important or trivial anything may appear to be, everything that’s ever existed in the past, exists now, or will exist in the future, exists only because of the workings of 'myoho-renge-kyo'. These three laws are also the basis of the four fundamental forces and if they didn't function, neither we nor anything else could go on existing. Simply put, all forms of existence, including the seasons, day and night, birth, death and so on, are moving forward in an ongoing flow of continuation, rhythmically reverting back and forth between the two states of ‘myo’ and ‘ho’ in accordance with ‘renge’ and by way of ‘kyo’. Even stars are dying and being reborn again in accordance with the workings of ‘myoho-renge-kyo’. ‘Nam’ is like a password or key; it allows us to reach deep within our life and fuse with or become one with ‘myoho-renge-kyo’. On a more personal basis, nothing ever happens by chance or coincidence, it’s the causes that we’ve made in our past, or are presently making, that determine how these laws function uniquely in each of our lives from moment to moment, as well as our environment. By facing east, in harmony with the direction that the Earth turns and rhythmically chanting ‘Nam-myoho-renge-kyo’ repeatedly for a minimum of ten minutes daily, any of us can gain actual proof of its effects in our life. By building up a force from within, it allows us to pierce through even the thickest layers of our karma and reach directly into the ultimate wisdom of our and all other life. Unlike the fantasy of a magic wand to make our problems vanish, chanting ‘Nam-myoho-renge-kyo’ awakens our innate wisdom and brings to the surface our hidden potential, a much clearer realisation and understanding of our good and bad karma, and positive ways that we can both cope with and change our negative circumstances into positive ones. It brings forth the wisdom that can free us from the ignorance and stupidity that is preventing us from accepting and being proud of who we truly are, regardless of our race, colour, gender or sexual preference. It also allows us to see and understand things outside of ourselves more clearly and, by way of the electromagnetic forces of which we are all a part, helps us to connect with, or draw towards us, any external circumstances or help that we need. Proof of this effect soon becomes obvious to anyone who chants ‘Nam-myoho-renge-kyo’ on a regular basis. Of course, the more sincerely we chant, the more powerful and faster its effect will be.﻿ At risk of sounding like the dirty hippy I am, you are. The world is viewed in individual perspective, and you'll never find light that you don't find in yourself or see invest in someone else. A newborn babe. If you can look at a child or a puppy and not find a feeling go love and joy, and happiness, you will never know love and joy and happiness.

It depends what you mean by tired. Babies, children and teenagers sleep much more than adults. If they don't then they get far more tired and sleepy than old people. My grandmother swore she hardly slept at all. If you mean stamina, then yes, the older you get the more quickly your muscles tire when working hard. You can change this to a considerable degree by exercising regularly. Why do some people look tired as they get older? What makes young men turn into grumpy old men? Do older people simply get tired of living? Why do I feel tired after emptying my bowel? Why do we lose friends as we age? I think we get tired as we get older because our cells also are getting weaker everytime they divide. As a result, aging process will occur.
Bitstrips Around June of last year, one of my most favorite sites of  all time  was announced to be shut down in a day It was a… beautiful site It let you made comics to whatever freedom you want as long as you were patient, and dedicated (also if it didn’t break any rules, like ya know, big giant dicks) Here are some of my pieces, I was still using edgename: Demon_Eye, that’s how fucking long I’ve been using it It’s jagged, sure but it won me 3rd place This one’s a tad bit anti-semitic, but it was all in good fun (sorry whoever is offended by this, I was an edgy 11 year old) The theme was towel This piece was my highest rated one, good times I never got the chance to finish this piece, shame It was shutting down, we had a day, which felt like minutes, told in advance, and this community, which has ran for 9 years, and me, being a 4 year runner, had to say goodbye to this loving community of friends, lads, enemies, lovers and all that bunch, it was just SHUT DOWN Because Bitstrips was bought by Snapchat, fuck off snapchat Luckily, we were given the chance to save all our characters and posts, that’s why I still have these I stayed up until 11 PM, on a school day no less, because I wanted to see the last moments of my beloved site The site I used since I was 9, 4 years later, after making good friends, seeing drama come and go, seeing great strips and very  very  terrible ones, it was over Rest in peace, Bitstrips Page One 2007–2016 Now all Bitstrips does is make shitty emojis, fuck off It’s a shame to see something like this happen, a beloved site many children and adults used to get away from life, shut down by the company that owned them And if you can’t imagine how this felt: It was basically Club Penguin shutting down, but at a smaller scale If I got one wish from a genie, no joke, I would bring this site back What is the saddest thing you've ever seen as a police officer? What is the saddest thing you've ever seen? What was the happiest moment in your life? What is the saddest thing someone ever said to you? What is the saddest thing you have ever seen on the internet? The saddest goodbye moment that I experienced was with my dog. I studied in Bangalore and visited home in semester breaks. In January 2012, when i was leaving home for Bangalore I wished everyone good bye but could not find my dog. Whenever I pack my bags the night before he understands that I will leave him and go back again. I searched the entire house and found him under a bed in one of the rooms. I called him many times but he did not come out. I almost crawled on the ground and went to the other corner under the bed where he was. He did not even turn his head towards me. This broke my heart. I said him I am leaving and came out . Cried my heart out before getting into the car to go to the airport. I guess he knew he had less time. He passed away on May 2nd 2012 and I never saw him again. Maybe I got a feeling too that I will not see him again so I was so heart broken that he did not talk to me ( i always talk to him) when I was leaving. I miss him every second and wish I never studied outside . The next break I did not want to go home. I knew no one would be waiting for me at the gate. The saddest goodbye I ever experienced was with my dad. I started sobbing just typing that much. He didn't die or injured or sick. But when I was 6 and we still lived in our big house in Missouri just before bed time he called me into the kitchen and sat me down on his lap. "Vivian(fake name) I'm going to tell you something you can't tell anyone else. Very soon I'm going back to Ethiopia to visit my brothers, okay. And I might be gone for a long time. But don't worry I'll come back. And remember don't tell anyone except for your sisters.","What about mommy?","It's okay I already told her.". 7 years later I still remember the exact conversation. But that wasn't the worst goodbye. A month or so later he returned with gifts from all our relatives(we have A Lot). And I was in kindergarten then so I didn't notice the change of atmosphere between my parents.  A year or just under a year later he leaves again, this time for good. He planned for us to come with him and move halfway across the world to Africa to be with his and hers family(they both are from Ethiopia \U0001f1ea\U0001f1f9). But although it is not all rural farms, their president has been leading for 20+ years, and it was a mess. Plus the schools weren't great(I went once and visited my cousin's school and the teacher had a belt for older students and a stick for the young ones as punishment). Growing up there she knew all of this, and she wanted more for her girls. So she decided to stay, my father being the stubborn man he is refused my moms pleas for him to stay and went on his own. My mom working as a nurse at the time couldn't afford to pay off the house, feed her 3 growing girls, and her mother, with her one pay check, and still go to all our field trips. So we sold the house and moved in with her in laws. As you can imagine it was very tense between them. But again being as young as I was hadn't noticed. Oh I loved it at my grandparents house. Especially my grandmother. She would tell us stories of her childhood and ones she would make up, she could make a game out of anything. Once she took me to her gym to ge swimming just the two of us. And I wanted to go in the hot tub with her because I didn't want to play by myself. And one of the people inside told me that I was to young but my grandmother gave him one look, and he never bothered us again. But like all good things it didn't last. My mom and grandma had a really big argument. We found an apartment and moved as soon as possible. All the while my father would come visit us every thanksgiving through about Valentine's Day(this was 2years). I remember making him a bunch of cards and a welcome home sign. And one of the best feelings was when he walked through the door running into his arms and just being completely enveloped. Because he is a tall guy and my mom is pretty petite so I never really got that kind of hug. And I just remember burrying my head into his stomach and breathing in his cologne.  By the time I was in third grade we had moved into our new two bedroom apartment with 5 girls. My two sisters and mom slept in her queen bed and her mom and I share a bunk bed. With her having polio she stays in the bottom bunk woth my stuff animals and I on top. He came for thanksgiving once in our new apartment. In the moths before his visit our phone calls have been less and less frequent and we all grew apart. But when he came that year I foolishly thought he wouldn't leave again. I thought that all those wishes I'd made on birthday cakes and dandelions had worked. That we would move back into our big house and I would get to be with my old best friend and things would work out. But I was wrong.  That February we went to the daddy daughter dance at the community center. I can honestly say it was one of the best night of my life. My straightened my Afro and I wore that new I dress I bought for the occasion. Our picture was even published the the local newspaper. About 2 weeks later he was leaving again, for good this time. But before he left he gave me his iPone as it would no longer work in Ethiopia. As a 3rd graded the phone distracted me enough that I wasn't that sad when he left. The next holiday season was my hardest goodbye. At the time I expected him to come back like he always had. But as the day passed and thanksgiving got closer, my hope got stronger. I kept hoping he would maraculously arrive. But I knew when my mom called my for dinner that was not going to happpen. This was my hardest goodbye. I was finally saying goodbye to the dream that my father would comeback forever. My mom bless her heart she works so hard to make it up for us. She holds two jobs and never has a day of. I can only wish to have the patience and virtue she has. But I still cry whenever I think of this. Whenever I think of this I remember these lyrics from Hamilton-"But the sun comes up, and the world still spins"
The major factor which is detrimental to a battery life is the battery cycles; amount of times it has been fully depleted & charged back. If it stays plugged in, then the cycles don't increase. But you do have to deplete it on a fortnightly basis to keep the battery properly calibrated. Another point to keep in mind is the drop in charge holding capacity of the cells. It varies based upon the technology(composition of the cells & lot more). You could try searching for iPad related stats where it has been used as a POS/Kiosk/schools to get an idea of device replacement cycles. How do I switch off the payment mode in iPad Air 2? Can my iPad Air 2 cause cancer? I use it 5-8 hours a day on the past 6 months. What are the risk for my health? I have an iPad Air 2, and I have a problem. When I delete an application I find it after some hours redownloaded. What should I do? Can a 13 inch MacBook Air last 4 years of college? Should I buy an iPad Air 2 for Christmas this year? In almost ideal conditions of weather and usual usage, an iPad should last quite long in year as long as 6–8 years. There is something about Apple products as much as i have seen with people around me that even if we use its products cautiously, they tend to stop working after a certain time period. It can start showing lines on screen, other screen issues, hardware button wearing out or even as blunt as the device simply becoming dead one fine day. Although such demerits exist, the device would work really efficiently till it is in working condition. As you need to use it on a professional level, you need to know that every battery has a prescribed number of charges and discharges as mentioned by the manufacturer. So that could help you figure out your estimate. Besides, every battery if used in the manner that it is completely charged and such, only after it is completely discharged, meaning to say that if the battery is uniformly charged and discharged, then it lasts as long as it can under ideal conditions. (From my personal experience - i have a MacBook Pro 17-inch which has absolutely no battery issues though it is 7 and a half years old as of today.) Apart from battery, the other thing you should be careful about is temperature of the environment. High temperatures just may catalyse marginal evaporation of circuit contacts in the chip board, which may lead to lessening of the product life. Moisture level in the environment doesn't much affect an iPad as it has a good packing physically.
With the help of  E-Surveillance . When restaurateurs display good hygiene at their restaurants, it positively impacts customers as they feel safe to eat there. Thus, appropriate resources have to be there to monitor food hygiene accompanied with the hygiene of cooks, waiters, other staff members, and the restaurant’s overall cleanliness. Hygiene in restaurants vitally contributes to their brand image. There are some common things that account for hygiene at restaurants. These may include: Neatness of employees Cleanliness of floor Neatness of walls Adequate cleaning of raw food Appropriate placement of dustbins Cleanliness of utensils and crockery Through e-surveillance, you can keep a check on the hygiene. With  e-surveillance , it becomes feasible to keep unhygienic components in check and minimize the occurrence of shortcomings for hygiene.

Well, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy is certainly easier, quicker, with a lot less to learn and master, and can produce significant improvements. See  What’s the Difference Between CBT and DBT? | Psych Central  for more thoughts on CBT and CBT. Per the article: “ Dialectical behavior therapy  (DBT) is a specific form of cognitive-behavioral therapy. DBT seeks to build upon the foundation of CBT, to help enhance its effectiveness and address specific concerns that the founder of DBT, psychologist Marsha Linehan, saw as deficits in CBT.” . . . “Whether  cognitive-behavior  therapy or  dialectical behavior therapy  is right for you is a determination best made in conjunction with an experienced therapist. Both types of psychotherapy have strong research backing and have been proven to help a person with a wide range of mental health concerns.”
A score of 105 in COMEDK is a respectable one..... You will be getting some good colleges and branch with your score..... But remember that only the few top colleges of COMEDK are excellent and decent enough to take admission..... And all these goodcolleges have a higher fees.... I would suggest you to take educational loan if you get a chance to the top colleges of Bangalore or COMEDK ..... If you get a cheap college with a lower rank your career would not be fruitful enough.... So i would advise you if you if you get a good college then only take admission there with an educational loan because they might come upto 12 lakhs for four years.... Thank You...
When we engage the field of ethics from an objective perspective there is always pain placed somewhere because by nature we are not separate from the field. The denial of this fact creates a place of pain when engaged in objectively. We must correctly enter the field in regards to IT’S qualities; one of which is me. Here the only rule is love your neighbor as yourself. Meaning all the points in the field are equally important and each reflects a unique part of the whole. So, how do we engage judgements???…..only thru a group that is connected completely to the goal of the whole of humanity. Only authentic Kabbalah teaches how to use our ego to correctly bestow upon humanity …..without fractures. http://laitman.com/2009/10/revea... What are your views on Peter Singer as an ethical philosopher? Are ethics a myth? What is mean by being ethical mean actually? What does being ethical in a business mean? Which is more important, doing right or doing good? Ethic’s aren’t objective doesn’t mean that you are permitted to do whatever you want. It means that the terms “good/ethical” and “bad/unethical” have unsubstantiated assumptions behind them. When folks were more religious, they could say, “God has given us absolute truths in the Bible or Quran or whatever, and our reasoning should begin from there.” We can’t do that now. So what we try to do is find assumptions that most people agree with and consider them as starting points. Often, problems with those assumptions are revealed, so we regroup and try again. But the burden to make a valid argument still exists. Lack of objectivity and “absurdity” are not the same. So, you cannot make up your own rules as you see fit. Your view on ethics must withstand logical scrutiny. Yes. Does that mean it’s consensual? No. Society usually calls consensual ethics the legal system. In fact in a representative democracy, the consensus of ethical behavior must be represented by the legal system. Do laws change? Yes, case in point, the prohibition of marijuana. Several States have changed their laws affecting legality of possession. You know why? The majority or consensus of society, has no ethical qualms about it’s usage. Do all laws reflect ethical values. Yes. Even the regulatory statues. How do you decide what and how to regulate? Laws and regulations are designed to re enforce what society deems ethically correct. Ethics are only relative among a distinct elite in our society. It helps them rationalize their use of power. There are objective truths and ethics. They tend to revolve around do no harm, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Well, what defines a valid ethical value?An ethical value which is an ethical value or an ethical value that is in compliance to objective normality. If the first option pertains to you, then it is valid. If the 2nd option pertains to you, then it’s invalid!
It is often the case that when a person falls in love head over heels, they forget about things like self-respect or personal boundaries. So they allow a person they “love” to treat them in a complete inappropriate way. This behavior is usually linked to lack of self-love and emotional dependence on someone. The problem is that the longer a person allows another one to treat him/her like $hit, the harder is to stop this relationship. We tend to overvalue things in which we invested loads of time and emotions. If a girl ignores a guy, will it make him chase her? When will girls begin to notice the nice guys? What does it mean when a girl plays with her hair while talking to a guy? Do girls get bored by nice guys? Why do nice guys get friend-zoned? Growing up, I'd always assumed that I would end up married to an abusive man, that after marriage everything would go downhill, because I thought that was a much more realistic fate than finding a knight in shining armor, sprinkling a little fairly dust, and POOF, happily ever after. So, I fell for just about every asshole who came my way. I thought that they might just be assholes because they'd never experienced love, so maybe I could change them if I could just love them with all I've got—And if i couldn't change them, oh well, it's my fate to marry a jerk anyway. I figured that a perfect guy should have his own perfect girl, and I knew that I've never been perfect so of course I would have to settle for a jerk. Then, one day, I met someone who seemed like a funny jerk, an ass who knew how to be adventurous and have fun. He intrigued me and I needed a bit of excitement in my life, so I got to know him better. We've been together now for over a year, and as it turns out, he's not an asshole at all—in fact, he's the sweetest, most loving man I've ever met and I wouldn't trade him for the world. He isn't who I thought he was, and I thank my lucky stars for that, because now I see that it's not my fate to have to settle for the most rotten apple at the bottom of the barrel. I thought that I didn't deserve anything more than a heartless jerk. I thought I was going to live the rest of my life with someone who would never love me, never treat me as a human being, and I was okay with that because I didn't think I could ever deserve more than that. Now, I can't speak for other girls. I don't know exactly why they choose to love an ass and turn a blind eye to the nice guy. But I can tell you that I did it because I thought I wasn't worthy of a nice guy, and I was afraid that I would cheat the nice guys I knew out of finding the perfect girls for them. Also, bad boy personas are kinda hot, so there's that :D Nice guys find it difficult to express themselves sometimes and girls want those who can actually show them what they feel about them. So girls end up believing those fake gestures and promises made by assholes and then regret meeting them whereas the nice guys still don’t know how to express their love for them Define asshole and a perfect guy first. Firstly,love is an emotion that can be aroused for anyone. It doesn't takes your permission before falling for a person, does it? And loving a person is the most beautiful thing one can do. Coming back to your question, this kinda situation can occur with anyone. Even boys can end up falling for wrong girls. You are just generalising shit maybe because you have encountered the situations like above more in your life or probably you yourself were a part of it. you just think about yourself and not other stud guys. You play the role of a good and set example for others. All the luck to you! Short answer. A father is supposed to model the type of person or behavior that he wishes and hopes his daughters will look for in their own future partners. If that model or template is that of an asshole, its difficult for the daughter to see passed it, because its is the long established template for what a man is supposed to be. Thats why women, and men, habitually keep dating the same types of people. A string if assholes instead of looking for a keeper.
If it looks something like this: it is possible you have been bitten by a tick and infected with Lyme disease. If this image isn’t a good match, try going to  Google Images  and searching for “red circle rash” or similar terms to find something that is a better match; if you go to the parent web page it will give you context. I recommend you see a doctor to find out if this is a sign of Lyme disease. A course of antibiotics given early may help reduce problems that can arise from Lyme disease.  Lyme Disease | Lyme Disease | CDC  If it turns out that it isn’t Lyme disease, so much the better, but then at least you will know.
I knew it fairly well to 12x12, but looking back, I think my algebra skills were much more important than memorizing multiplication tables. Lots of the time, the math that I do has more value when I leave answers in terms of variables rather than a numeric value. Does it make sense to make children learn the math tables by heart? What is 3x70? What did you learn today about life? Why are certain multiplications or 'times tables' easier to learn? What is something new you learned this week? I am a retired teacher and unfortunately students do not memorize the tables. This causes major problems later. Why? Let’s compare it to building a house. If the foundation is weak the house will fall. Basic math facts are the foundation and eventually a student will get to a point where their math education will collapse. In essence a teacher that does not insist on students learning basic math facts is setting a student up for failure in math. I am retired because I actually said this and was “attacked” for not following the political decisions of education rather than being allowed to teach students. Beware - education is more about politics in the USA than about teaching and learning.
Syllabus wise, in India, IT and CSE has not got much difference. In both, students study same subjects, may be in different semesters. But due to some unknown reason, IT branch usually gets less intakes and whereas CSE is almost filled up. I am 4th year IT student, I have merely felt any difference in CSE or IT apart from less number of students. Which branch of engineering has the best scope in the future? Which branch has more scope in future: civil or computer science? Which one has more scope, computer science or IP? Which branch has more scope CS, IT or data science? Which branch of engineering has a good scope in the future? In India there is not much difference in courses for both. Subjects get shuffled in odd and even semesters and we all know that. But given the choice of today’s market i will Pick up CSE any time. Although, the course difference is not much so IT need not worry as well. But pick CSE if you get a choice and also take the factor of college in mind. I am not sure the definition of the *future of yours ?, Some people want to become prime minister and some want to just get a job. If you are clear with the definition of your future , which only you know better Its hard to provide any wisdom to you. IT and CS are same almost and hardly 4–5 subjects are different but CS students have advantage(I don't know y) but CS students are preferred over IT students. And CS is good if u want to do higher studies. Basically IT is derived from CS only.
Throughout the ages, cultures and religions have tried to stamp out homosexuality. How may we explain its endurance through the lens of evolution? Although homosexuality seems to have epigenetic components resulting in women who gave birth to boys more likey having homosexual children afterwards, homosexuality seems to be an acquired, not an inherited property. Homosexuality seems to be linked to hormone level fluctuations in the mother during certain phases of pregnancy. These fluctuations can have countless causes beginning with stress and ending with alcohol abuse. Therefore they can hardly be avoided which again leads to a fairly constant ratio of gay people of approximately 5%. This also means that while you are born gay, you are not conceived gay. Homosexuality is not inherited but a result of omnipresent, uncontrollable environmental influences and with that no direct subject to evolution, no matter how hard cultures have tried to eradicate it. How do you explain evolution to a 10-year-old? Does evolution explain why we sleep? Is culture a result of evolution? Does evolution say life began randomly on earth? How does evolution explain the birth of birds? >Throughout the ages, cultures and religions  >have tried to stamp out homosexuality. No. SOME cultures and religions have been hostile to homosexuality, but not all, or even most. Once you get outside of the areas dominated by the Abrahamic religions, you tend to see less hate and fear directed towards homosexuals. Remember that the Abrahamic religions were not as widespread in the past as they are now. Homosexuality is a natural variation within human sexuality. It has been around for as long as we have written records, and was not always seen as problematic. In some cultures it was even seen as the norm during certain periods of a person’s life. The idea of two genders isn’t even universal. There is one culture today that recognizes five genders, and has for centuries or longer. Three-gender cultures were not unknown in certain times and places, as well. Throughout history, cultures have varied from aversion, indiference, acceptance and compulsory requirement for homosexuality. There is no common cultural or religious norm. Its endurance for human survival is not hard to explain - Love thy brother. Because when you do that, people defending against a common enemy are less likely to break and run. Well that was the theory anyway. Also, people weren't stupid. Homosexual or not, men and women understood their familial duty to have offspring. I agree with Christian Winter. The simplest way to look at this is that in any given population, there will be a percentage of people who are “otherly sexed” in various ways, including being homosexual. Much the same as a percentage is left-handed or green-eyed or whatever. These things are relatively neutral from an evolutionary standpoint. Note that for the many cultures through history that have condemned homosexuality, as many more have been quite accepting or been quite neutral on the subject. As well, there is a degree of hypocrisy involved in some of these cultures. Just as a for-instance, it’s well-understood that in Afghanistan, the culture is strongly Islamic and homosexuality is strongly frowned on. At the same time, relationships with women outside of being actually married are strongly condemned as well. So, in many of the “tribal” areas, the custom of having “comfort boys” is widespread. This is not viewed as homosexual behavior, with the participants somehow rationalizing what they are doing as acceptable within their culture. My original question ( - too long): If we accept that homosexuality has a genetic component (in addition to environmental factors), and given that homosexuality has endured (in spite of rigorous efforts to root and stamp it out) throughout the ages - may we infer that there may be some evolutionary advantage in having a proportion of homosexuals in your tribe? And given that homophobia is enshrined in so many cultures and religions, and if we accept that traditions generally stem from historic human sentiment and intuition - what is the evolutionary explanation for the prevelance of homophobia?

That is a classical application of the “Pythagoras group” of theorems. With your setting, [math] e= CD=3\mathrm{cm}[/math] ,  [math]d = CE = 4\mathrm{cm}[/math] ,  [math]c=DE = 5\mathrm{cm}[/math]  (Pythagoras). Now you apply Euclid’s theorems: Let  [math]H =[/math]  the intersection of the height  [math]h[/math]  on  [math]c[/math]  with  [math]c[/math]  and  [math]p=DH,\, q=EH.[/math] Then  [math]e^2=pc, \, d^2=qc, \,  h^2=pq[/math] . You get  [math]p=\frac95, \, q = \frac{16}{5}[/math] and  [math]h^2=\frac{144}{25}.[/math] So  [math]h=\frac{12}{5}, [/math]  and  [math]CG[/math]  can be calculated using Pythagoras on the triangle with sides  [math]h+c, p, CG [/math]  which gives you  [math]CG=\sqrt{(5+\frac{12}{5})^2+(\frac{9}{5})^2}=\sqrt{58}\cong 7.6[/math] Let ABC be a right angled triangle with BC=5 cm and AC=12 cm. Let D be a point on the hypotenuse AB such that angle BCD 30°. What is length of... Given a right triangle ABC, if angle A is 45 degrees, and side a is 4 m., what is the length of side b? Hint: Angle C is the right angle. A point on the hypotenuse of a triangle is at distance a & b from the sides of the triangle, then the minimum length of the hypotenuse is? The triangle ABC, is a right angle triangle with sides a=3 b=4 and c=5.Given on his hypotenuses is a point S, which is equally away from the o... If D is the mid point of the hypotenuse AC of a right angle triangle ABC, prove that BD is equal to 1/2 AC? CDE is a right-angled triangle, CD = 3 cm (altitude), CE = 4 cm (base). DE = 5 cm (hypotenuse), by Pythagoras theorem. DEFG is a square of side 5 cm. You want the length of CG. <EDC = tan (inverse) (4/3) = 53.13010235 degrees. Therefore <GDC = 90 + 53.13010235 = 143.13010235 degrees. In triangle GDC, CG^2 = DG^2 + DC^2 + 2*DG*DC*cos GDC = 5^2 + 3^2 + 2*5*3*cos 143.13010235 = 25 + 9 + 30*(-0.8) = 25 + 9 + 24 = 58, or CG = 58^0.5 = 7.615773106 cm. Method 2. <DEC = tan (inverse) (3/4) = 36.86989765 degrees <GEC = 45 + 36.86989765 = 81.86989765 degrees GE = 5*2^0.5. In triangle GEC, CG^2 = GE^2 + EC^2 - 2*GE*EC*cos GEC = (5*2^0.5)^2 + 4^2 - 2*5*2^0.5*4*cos 81.86989765 = 50 + 16 - 2*5*2^0.5*4*0.141421356 = 50 + 16 - 8 = 58 CG = 58^0.5 = 7.615773106 cm By the Law of Cosines, [math]CG^2 = CD^2 + DG^2 - 2 (CD)(DG) \cos \angle CDG[/math] Let’s set  [math]x=CG.[/math]  We see  [math]\angle CDG = 90^\circ +  \angle CDE.[/math] Since 3,4,5 is a Pythagorean Triple, we know  [math]DE=EF=FG=DG=5[/math] [math]x^2 = 3^2 + 5^2 -  2 (3)(5) \cos (90^\circ + \angle CDE)[/math] [math]x^2 = 34 + 30 \sin \angle CDE[/math] The sine is opposite over hypotenuse [math]x^2 = 34 + 30 (4/5) = 58[/math] [math]x = \sqrt{58}[/math]  cm Drawing a picture helps to visualize the problem. Definitions are also very important. First we are talking about a square, so all sides are the same length, so find one side and you know that the other 3 sides are the same length. The picture and the problem show that the length of the triangle’s hypotenuse is the same length as one of the sides of the square, so finding the hypotenuse length gives you the answer. Finally, use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse: 9 + 16 = c squared 25 = c squared c = 5

Yes, easy. The CTA has station agents at the O'Hare subway (“ELevated") entrance, to explain what kind of fare card to buy. The CTA fare from O'Hare into the city is $5, and allows 1 transfer to a bus or train line, so it’s about 1/3rd of what a shuttle bus from O'Hare might charge, and 10–20% of what a cab into the “loop" (downtown Chicago) would cost. All other CTA elevated and subway trains (and busses) cost $2.25, regardless of distance. Fare card machines don't give change back, so make sure you have a $5 bill or 5 singles, if you just want to pay the one-time fare into downtown. Also see the CTA website,  www.transitchicago.com . The CTA O'Hare blue line trains run 24 hours, with trains every 4–8 minutes during rush hour and every 8–20 minutes during other times. Trains are not usually crowded when they leave O'Hare, but can become very crowded before reaching downtown (16 miles), so pick a location at either end of the railcar, where your luggage won't block any extra seats. (Ask at your hotel where to pick up the train back to O'Hare when leaving, so that you are more likely to get a seat.) Busses give a 25¢ discount when you use a fair card instead of paying cash. CTA rail lines will permit free transfers to other rail lines at certain stations, otherwise, each transfer costs 25¢, charged to a CTA fare card when you board the next bus or train within 2 hours or less after paying a fare on an earlier bus or train (up to 2 additional rides within 2 hrs). The CTA offers daily and multiday passes when you arrive, or you can go to the  ventracard.com  website to open a transit account and then request a card but mail and/or download their iPhone or Android app, to use your new acct, to pay fares.  Ventra App | Ventra Any references at the ventra website to pace busses and metra are to regional suburban commuter bus and rail lines, which may not be relevant, if you don't have business or sidetrips planned to the Chicago Suburbs. O'Hare is an in-city location. Why is public transportation so bad in the U.S.? Is the Chicago public transportation system any good? What is the average driving time between Chicago and New York, and how does the public transportation system in these cities compare to Boston... Why does the USA have a very poor public transport system compared to other developed countries? What cities in India are the best in public transport? The elevated train system is color coded and easy to understand. The bus system is a more complex. Look at the CTA website and plan out your route in advance. It’s not cheap, but you can buy multi-ride passes at the train stations and other places. All these answers are great I just wanted to add one tidbit on price. There is a  small fee  for not having a ventra card and purchasing some of the singles pass that everyone left out If you order a ventra card ahead of time or have a bank with wireless pay enabled you don’t have to pay the disposable media fee which can bring your price up from $2.25 to $3.  CTA Fare Information  search media fee. Ordering the ventra card ahead of time is “free” they give you a $5 refund of the card fee to your first fare which would most likely be the $5 ride from O’hare. When I ordered mine I actually got the card and $5 free for no charge. Looks like it might be slightly different now Yes, it is fairly easy to understand and inexpensive. The Train at O’Hare is really easy as you can only get on one train and it just goes one direction from O’Hare. The rest of the trains and buses are also really simple. The buses are easy because they mostly just stick to one street and don’t have complex routes. They don’t go from one place to another place like in some cities but rather for the most part just go up and down a single street. The CTA trains are color coded. When you land in O'Hare there's only one train (Blue Line) that goes into the city. It's really simple to navigate. Just use maps on your smart phone and you will be able to navigate rather simple.
That depends. Are you giving up without having tried to pursue a relationship with this person or are you giving up because you are afraid to try and start a relationship with the person? If it's the second one no, you should not give up. Unless you have been verbally rejected by this person, I don't see why you wouldn't try to pursue a relationship with them. Ask them out. Get rejected. Then move on. It's easier to move on when you know for a fact that a romantic relationship between you and this person will never happen.
It is the probability of getting exactly 9 or exactly 10 heads. The two are mutually exclusive, so p(9) + p(10). You can find those using the  Binomial distribution .
Questions will come from any chapter. It is random. Even 3 questions may come from 1 topic. So every topic is important. Nothing special about the 3 you mentioned except that they are theoretical questions.
I think it would depend on the chip manufacturer as to whether it would work in both countries. If it is a huge multinational company that has made the chips and readers then the chances would be good. There are at least 4 different microchips made in the US with a couple being more popular. The best thing you can do is ask a vet or maybe your local animal shelter if they can scan your dog’s chip. Shelters use the reader for the most commonly used chip. I’m sure they’d be happy to help so that you know, they want your dog to have a way home too. If it scans make sure you update your contact info. How can you feel a dog's microchip? Why do people from some East Asian countries eat dogs? What are some ways to locate a dog with a microchip? How can we connect with a database? How do I connect with my dog? I had an Australian patient whose chip was not recognized in any of the databases we usually check in the US. It was a popular brand of chip in Australia. So I think they aren't integrated. It may be possible to reregister the chip number in an American database. I would suggest calling a vet near where you are intending to live in the US and asking the clinic. They may or may not ask you to bring him in to be rechipped with your new address.

Since it's too late in night, this may not be a very detailed answer but it may get you going. Core java is basically Java SE (Standard Edition). It consists of the core parts of Java platform, e.g. Java runtime, Java libraries, virtual machine etc. It is base where most of the java programs are written. Programs written in core java are primarily meant to be run on workstations. Advance java is basically J2EE, (Enterprise Edition), which provides functionality to make use of network to publish your programs or consume other programs. Programs written in advance java are tarheted for enterprise level servers, or are used to serve many people. E.g. Servlets, EJB, JSP etc. Angular is not java. It is a famous Javascript framework for providing ease in writing good looking interactive web apps. You can write a very nice web frontend with Angular really quickly, fairly easy, with lots of functionality out of the box and what not.
You might want to tighten up the criteria a little. 1279 where? Not a lot going on in that year. What have they got with them, technology-wise, etc? There is a  fictional series  about an American town which gets transported back to Europe in 1632, into the middle of the Hundred Years’ War. I only read the first book, as I got bored reading about good ol’ boys a-whoopin’ n a-hollerin’ n a-shootin’ up the place. In short, they were right where they belonged - in an uncivilised war zone. There’s also  John Birmingham’s excellent but weighty Axis of Time series , about a 2021 US-led multinational task-force that gets sent back in time to WWII. This really explores the issues of cross-time pollution  and  individual reaction to being stuck irrevocably in the past, leaving friends and loved ones behind. Eric Flint, author of the 1632 series, turns up in the Axis of Time series as a Secret Service agent. If I were teleported to 550 million BC, how could I survive? What could I eat? If you could teleport back in time, what would happen if you teleport back to present of which you are teleporting while teleporting? What is it like to move back to India after a long time in the USA? Do you regret moving back to India from USA? Is time travel possible? Due to the time of 1783 being a part of the Enlightenment period while 1279 being apart of the “Christian dominance”, I can imagine some ideological backlash among the two eras. But for now, let’s focus on the geography. I take it you want to also transport the people along with their belongings and homes back in time to 1279 on the exact location that they left earth from (aka  Back to the Future  style of time travel). In which case there would be a bit of fighting between the native Indians and the Europeans, but I think that with the 1783’s immunity to disease as well as advanced weaponry would pretty much dominate the area. Aside from the mass confusion of everyone in the colonies, trade would be an issue. There would be no trade with any of the European mainlands (at least for now) due to them not even hearing about the “new colonies of America”. This would be a problem for Americans as our economy is currently faltering at this point in time, but I think that the Americans would most likely use the newly abundant resources at their disposal (ex. the trees that they cut down to build their houses are now sprung back to life). So overall, our economy should be stable. As for the mingling of many cultures, let’s just say it won’t end well for either side. The Americans would most likely expand (like they already did in our timeline) and might actually make it to present day Oregon before the end of the century (due to the land not being held by anyone at this point in time (i.e. British forts, Louisiana Purchase, and Spanish conquering). With the America’s use of firepower (guns are not invented until 1364) as well as our strength in numbers (estimated around 3.1 million + at the start of 1783)*, we may actually take hold of Canada (a necessity by Americans at the time that actually started the War of 1812), Mexico (again, Americans wanted Mexico as seen in the events prior to the Mexican-American War), and the Caribbean Islands (do I need to talk about the Spanish-American War?). The Indians as well as the Europeans occupying the area at the time would not stand a chance against the American force. *With a projected growing economy and standard of living, the population in THIS timeline would most likely be more than the 3.1 million stated earlier. As for conflicts with Europe, I doubt there would be any. Despite the continent conquering new America, it was pretty isolationist at the time in our timeline. It would only make sense that the Americas in 1279 would have the same mindset. But when the war dies down, there are 3 projected paths the Americans may go towards: America spreads its influence across the world with its new acquired trading partners. The influence of 1783 America would bring an end to the Dark Ages in Europe, bring about a Renaissance hundreds of years earlier than in our timeline, and bring America into the realm of an empire. They continue their isolationist ideals until the times catch up with them. The other countries may catch up with America by either stealing some of their technology or (like in our timeline) gradually come up with the ideas for the technology themselves. This result is historically slower than the one previously mentioned, but the exact slowness may vary. America finds no use in trading and becomes completely self-reliant and isolationist. Other countries might perceive the Americas as the threat due to the Americas indifferent attitude towards the other nations at the time. The end result might bring about a war that will include almost all of Europe against the Americas. They might even call it a new crusade (Enlightenment thinking with the strong Protestantism in the Americas is seen as a threat to the Catholic Europe, way before the idea of Protestantism became a reality with Martin Luther). The most likely outcome is America winning this supposed war, crippling Europe, and will either lead to a: Invasion of Europe or No response by the Americans In my opinion, I would say that the most likely outcome would either be option #2 or #3, due to the American’s strong resentment of Europe at the time (this is right after the American Revolution keep in mind), but I’ll keep the theoreticals to a minimum. It couldn't trade as much with Europe, they would Dominate the Americas. They would have to be more self sufficient since they are no longer doing heavy trading with Europe nations. But the map would be insane, by present day they would have all of America, and would be the most scientificly advanced Nation on the planet. When Spain had a more stable economy and wouldn't rely on Gold from Mexico. By now we would have a Colony set up on Mars. And the time the industria revolution came around in Europ, we would have produced 1,000,000,000 Figet Spinners I think if you are mentioning to 1783’s U.S. to 1279? So I will have some scenario: Earlier industrial revolution: definitely the people in Europe would have found that they needed to catch up with the United States. Soon they would take any risks to do it. The techs from America would have been exported into the worldwide and we would have computer at late 16th century. Lol. The American would have to expand its culture far away than most of other countries. They would have occupied all the Americas and it would become English-language dominant. World Wars would have come earlier. At 18th century, no, not Seven Years’ War - it would have been WWI. And in early 19th century, Emperor Napoleon stood on the tanks and declared WWII. By the end of 20th century, so many space ships from Earth’d gone explore the world and we would have had laser guns and super troops. I bet that is what I know about scenario. But of course with it, they would have met a lot of resistance and also, there would have other difficulties - the Ottoman Empire would have never been founded. Russia, China would have problems and India would have hard time to reunite (but of course no Pakistan, no Bangladesh, no Nepal). And wtf? Soccer space too?
Why are sexually liberated ladies so popular among Indians? Around 40% of visitors on Quora are Indians (if You add the vast Indian diaspora spread across the world it could even touch around half :) 2. Most of the Indian users are from IT Metropolises (like Bangalore, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Mumbai and Pune) known for their socially-inept  Nerds  never having any sexual experience with girls   :) 3. Vast majority of Indians on Quora are Males (sexually frustrated teenage and young men below 30 who never had any sexual exposure :) 4. All of a sudden they get to read detailed (Read: titillating) sexual encounters of  escort  girls and sexually liberated women and they get sexually aroused :) 5. Then a lady by the name  Sal Rose  comes on Quora and starts sharing her  gangbang  experiences and get lapped up by perverts :) The funny thing is most Indian men would mistake a Japanese for a Western woman but does that matter? Not till they get to read lascivious stuff (and that through women) for free ;) Why are my questions not answered on Quora? Is it possible to get notified about every new question posted in some of the topics of Quora via e-mail? Why do some people ask questions on Quora that could easily be answered by using a search engine? Why is every third question on Quora is related to sex? How can I make it better? Why do people answer questions on Quora? Indian male here… so, I guess I qualify to answer. Indians have been known for their sex and sexual traditions since centuries… we actually wrote the book of love, Kamasutra. As Indians sex was never considered taboo or dirty, rather it was celebrated and infact we have monuments depicting sexual ​intercourse, some of our religious text mention it as a holy rite!! Then came the British… and they forced the Victorian mindset on us. So in a matter of 150 odd years of their rule, it was imbibed on us that sex is sin, and talking or practising sex openly (read outside of marriage) was considered a crime. Now, this is human tendency… the more you try to suppress anything, the more it will burst open or resist. Till the advent of internet, sex was not easily accessible in India. Not in the movies or magazines or even Sex education. Not even a lip kiss or french kiss!! So the population was hungry, almost ravenous… On the other hand, the western world was more forthcoming and open on matters of sex… thanks to the seventies (hippie movement) or the McKinsey report of the US. So, sex was casually depicted in movies and magazines as well…thank you, Hugh Hefner :) Now, thanks to the internet and the uncensored and free content available on tubesites, we are trying to make up for the lost time… literally!! I, myself, follow you, Laurie, Anna, Alice and your post appear automatically on my feed. Call me curious, perverted or a prude, I can't stop myself from reading them, as I am sure you won't be quoting verses from the Bible :D Ohh… did I mention, I also jump on posts talking about gyms and workouts, astronomy, physics, mathematics, comic books, philosophy…there is no end, and that’s what really pulls me to Quora (where else would I go, I have no facebook or instagram or Tinder or anything social…bummer) I am pretty much sure that many of my fellow Indians would agree with me. Those who don't… well, they are acting like a true Indian… calling it a sacrilege but yearning for it from within. With love and respect from an (horny, perverted, prude, creep, stalker, _____ add adjective(s) of your choice) Indian. Edit: next time I see your post, do you want me to think with my penis or my brain? Penis says read read read… brain says read but during bedtime :D :) :P We are the second most populous nation in the world. How do you think we got there? Binary fission?
What do you mean? What would a dentist write on a note to excuse you from school / work? If that is the case, there are a lot of diagnostics that could go there. For example a swollen parotid gland, a very powerfull abcess that causes the pain from the infected area to iradiate to your head, and so on . Hope this helps, dental medicine student here!
Outside of exam/interviews? Sure! Online Subnet Calculator As for exam/interviews, well, not really. Practice questions and keep working. You should find it easier the more you do. Eventually, you’ll remember some of the more common values by heart and be able to short cut some of the questions. Consider the IP address: 157.110.88.0.

What are some quick ways/tricks to calculate an IP subnet in your mind? How do I know if these IP addresses are in the same network? How can I ping an IP with a different subnet mask? What is the difference between subnet and subnet mask? It is easy already. You just need to get it right, and then practice a lot. As soon as you truly understand it, you will see how is it is. The easiest trickil is the magic number to create multiple subnets in FLSM, but you need to understand Subnetting first. You can try from  The ultimate guide to IPv4 subnetting . If you really don’t want to learn doing so, just look up ‘subnet calculator’ using your favorite search engine. Then, simply enter the parameters you want and it will tell you the results.

Often a powerful image is simple. The background is uncluttered. What you consider meaningful and glamorous others may see as a distraction. Georgia O’keeffe. Photo by Alfred Stieglitz. Photo is from Wikipedia. Now O’Keeffe was a famous painter, but this simple photo has no “bling”. It’s expressive, soulful, and simple. Her paintings were very sensual, and the photo mirrors that powerful sensuality, but in a subdued way. What are the photos that made everyone in India cry? How do people lock their profile picture on Facebook so no one can like or comment, just view? How can you find out someone's name from a picture? Do people see me like a picture on Facebook feed if I unlike that picture right away? Is there a way to find the most liked picture on Facebook? If so, what is the most liked picture? I would say it’s because most people aren’t glamorous nor do they feel they do much in the way of meaningful activity. If they did they wouldn’t be spending so much of their free time on FB. So, in that respect, seeing glamorous people doing meaningful things is difficult for them to take and as such they tend to gravitate to the ones who’s lives are more in line with their own. Also include the belief that they don’t find very much pleasure in seeing people with material things they can’t afford. Why do people like common pictures as opposed to glamorous or more meaningful pictures on Facebook? People like reality. “Glamorous” photos aren’t relatable, and people are  banner blind  to them. if I post a normal picture of me, perhaps a selfie or portrait, I get soo many likes, as opposed to when I portray myself as doing something interesting. Perhaps what you consider interesting isn’t the same as what your followers consider interesting. Perhaps they’re not following you because they like the same things as you. It could be interesting to try to work out what it is that they like - why they follow you - and then either play it up or start ignoring them. Maybe they’re not friend material. I got very few likes on my new SUV That’s probably because you’re showing off and nobody likes a show-off people have seen SUVs before “Common” pictures, as you put it, are often much more intimate than semi-professional photo sets. I don’t care what car you have. A million other people have the same one, in the same colour. Unless the picture is showing something interesting or unique about it, it’s page filler, and what the masses like doesn’t have to line up with what you like. It doesn’t have to mean your pictures or other content isn’t good. i suppose that simple photos links more attention because people want to be updated as fast as they can red the news and multitask during another task or surfing the web a more ditailed picture takes time to understand whats in there and most of the people who use Facebook dont have the time to realize
Createspace or KDP is free to use and providing your material is good enough (or interesting shall I say) then your ranking will go up. Just remember people like E L James (sorry to name drop) would not be where they are if they didn’t use these services. Don’t forget they also do a paying service which could help you reach global readers a lot faster and if you put a lot of time and effort into advertising then you’d be surprised how much the word gets about. With KDP you will find that for every copy bought; commission is sent directly to your bank account as long as you have a IBAN number from your bank. Do not be fooled into spending thousands of pounds on a publisher. I know somebody who did and it felt as though they were conned. If a good publisher believes you can both make money together they will not charge you through the backside for it.

Have you thought about getting a few copies of your book and handing it into your local library? I believe They require 3 - 6 copies but this can help with building an audience. Not everybody wants to pay for things these days so it’s a good start. I’m intrigued to know what your book is about, is it available online? Is self-publishing a book really worth it? I am writing a book on a social cause. Is it possible for me to get investors for this so that I may self-publish? Does crowdfunding work for ... What's the best way to self publish an e-book? Can I self-publish a book on Kindle? How can I self-publish a book in the USA? After you are sure the book has been edited so the text flows and there are no or next-to-no typos, you can start the process. Every major e-retailer has decent instructions, but you need to be able to load a ‘clean’ copy. I suggest copying your text, putting it in a program such as Notepad (part of Windows) and then putting it back into Word. You add the formatting (bold, centering) back. You do this so the ebook doesn’t have a mix of different fonts and such. You can try loading your Word file to Kindle or BN without going through these steps, but you’ll end up spending more time fixing rogue problems than you would if you did it right the first time. If you go to the index on my blog, look under publishing and you’ll see articles on formatting and related topics. Index I also offer a free course on Teachable that gives an overview of the steps involved in self-publishing. Thinking Through Self-Publishing Good luck! Elaine L. Orr Go to  http://www.kdp.amazon.com  and follow the instructions which are reasonably user-hostile but you can get there. You create a cover on the site or upload one; you upload your text in a Word or other format and fill in a few fields and you're done. That's not the problem. Now you have to market it! Well there’s the crappy way, where you self edit, create a cover yourself, throw it on amazon and hope suckers buy it. Then there’s the real way, where you hire a cover designer, an editor, a proofreader, and develop a marketing plan so that you can make sure your book will be successful. I don’t understand how people who write books without editors can look at themselves in the mirror and say their books are worth any money, but it’s possible to do it that way AND be very successful doing it. There are whole FB groups devoted to making books quickly and throwing them up online haphazardly to try to get a quick buck…and that way works. I just couldn’t do it that way.

So imagine two drivers in the race, A and B. A is leading the race and thus has track position. To try and “undercut” A, B may come in for an earlier pit stop which means he will put on fresher tyres earlier. This means that while A stays out on older tyres, B has pitted and is on newer tyres so will naturally be faster. B will be able to close the gap, such that when A does finally come in for a pitstop, he will now be behind B. But A's tyres will be fresher come the end of the race. The undercut essentially allows you to try and gain time initially to obtain track position by putting on fresher and faster tyres earlier. This is a great strategy on circuits where it is difficult to overtake but the downside is that by putting on fresher tyres before your opponent, once the other person pits, he will now have fresher tyres than you and will start catching up to you. Then, come the end of the race when your tyres are far more worn, they will have a greater chance of overtaking you. The undercut is key for track position and at say Monaco or Spain, this is very effective as overtakes are far more difficult. So to prevent this from happening teams would usually keep tabs on their competitors (listening to the broadcasted radio messages) and will try and mirror them to prevent the undercut. Or sometimes a change in strategy is used by going for a longer stint on the first set of tyres meaning that your tyres will be a lot more fresher and quicker come the end of the race compared to your competitor. However, in a track that encourages overtaking, the undercut isn't as effective as track position counts for less. I think Spa (Belgium) is a good example as there are many points on the circuit where an overtake can be effected, so in the same scenario of A having fresher tyres at the end, he will have a much better chance of overtaking B at the end of the race. Also, the undercut is hugely reliant on a quick pit stop and feeding back into “clean air” (not behind any other cars). This is because if the driver attempting the undercut gets stuck behind a slower car, he will not be able to make the same gain in time and his tyres will also degrade quicker - making the whole strategy redundant as he will in fact lose time to the person he tried to undercut. How many pit stops are there in a Formula One race? Does height plays a role in becoming a Formula 1 driver? Formula 1: Why do F1 drivers suddenly get so slow the lap before they pit? How many formula 1 drivers know how an engine works? What road cars do Formula One drivers own? The undercut is a pit strategy which has come into the fore in recent seasons, especially since 2010, when refuelling was banned again for cost and safety reasons. Since the cars carry all the fuel onboard at the start of the race, they get faster and faster as the race goes on. The only thing negating this weight advantage is tyre degradation, which makes them slower even as the fuel burning​ off should do the opposite. This has come even more into play in recent seasons as the Pirelli tyres have a tendency to lose performance as they degrade, contrary to the Bridgestones, which had a longer window of consistent performance. This was a request from the FIA, in order to spice up the races by increasing the number of pit-stops. For 2017, they have reverted to harder tyres on which the drivers can push for a longer time without suffering thermal degradation. Anyways, back to the answer. In order to make an undercut work , the car which is chasing the car ahead has to stay within a certain time delta, like 1.5–2 seconds. As the car behind pits, and switches onto fresher tyres, it can use the extra grip to put in one or more flying laps while the car it is hoping to jump this way can't really pick up the pace as its tyres are past their best. As a result, when the original lead car pits, it loses its advantage due to lapping slowly with worn tyres while the guy who pit earlier put his newer tyres to full use. Henceforth, this results in the car behind getting the jump on the car ahead. To prevent an undercut,  the lead car’s driver is usually instructed by his race engineer to pick up the pace and build a gap to the car behind, usually in the region of 3–4 seconds, depending upon the nature of the track, the time delta between different tyre compounds, and the relative competitiveness of the two cars. This way, even if the car behind pits a lap or two early, it can't jump the lead car as it has a time buffer which it can afford to lose without losing the lead of the race. Another way to counter this is to pit earlier than planned in the race strategy. This will catch the car behind unawares as the teams can only guess the estimated pit laps based upon practice and qualifying data. This does mean the car lead car pitting early has to extend one of its later tyre stints longer than ideally the team would like. But on tracks like Monaco, where track position is everything due to the difficulties in overtaking, this is an effective ploy. Footnote  : In years gone by, when refuelling was allowed, the undercut wasn't a viable option as cars were always fuelled light at the start of the race and each stop added fuel and hence, weight. In those days, the car hoping to jump a rival ahead of him on the track tried what we call an  overcut,  wherein   the car behind would stay out longer than the cars in front. As the cars pitting early would actually be slower for a few laps as a result of taking in more fuel, the guy staying out could put in a series of flying laps and cut any gaps he might have had. After his stop, he'd jump the guy in front. A lot of races were decided in the pits at that time, with very little on-track action, which is one of the reasons refuelling was banned. Since 2010, races have seen more overtaking than in the early 2000s. I can't really add too much to  Athithyan Chellappa’ s great answer. The only thing I will add, is that once you have achieved track position by using the undercut, yes the car(s) you have overtaken through said manoeuvre will have fresher tyres, however, teams will normally calculate in a gap where there will be no cars in the vicinity once you have gone back onto the circuit. With that in mind, because you have the track space to yourself, the driver can normally push harder to negate the fact that the car(s) behind will have fresher tyres later and you are no longer being affected by ‘dirty air’. My understanding of the undercut is Team A (which is behind Team B) pits first, gets back on the race track in clear air. Team A driver puts in quick laps to take advantage of the situation in order to either close the advantage or leap frog Team B. Team B pits, gets out either in front or behind Team A. How to defend against this strategy - minimize the advantage of the team attempting the undercut. Open a very big gap, or pit as soon as the other team pits so that they don’t get that much laps to close the gap. Let me explain it to you in layman terms. When you are driving the car, the tyres degrade with every passing lap. More the degradation, lesser the grip, lesser the speed through corners, more the lap time! Now what the undercut does is, it is helps you overtake the car or cars ahead of you effectively in the pit-stop phase. You pit before them and fit a new set or a lesser used set of tyres to usually go faster than them for as many laps as they stay out on track. Now because of your more grippier tyres, you will be able to close the gap on the person ahead significantly​ by doing better lap times than him. So, when they come in to have a change of tyres, you get past them without actually having to pass them on circuit. Countering this strategy is very easy. If you are the car ahead and guy behind you just pitted, you pit the very next lap to disable him from gaining enough time to get past you. Now that is considering both cars are on same strategy, if not, you will have to play it differently! Sometimes it doesn't work, sometimes it backfires if you get stuck in traffic, most of the time having position on track is better than making an early stop. You will see a lot of this in Monaco next time out. Cheers!
Well, it depends if we are talking about a Sativa strain or indica or hybrid. What I can say is if you have constant chronic pain, what it will feel like is “ow”, forget, “ow”, okay now….and repeat. The pain isn’t nearly as bad (try it for a month, then add in a whole lot of black pepper a couple of days in a row without cannabis, you’ll know exactly the levels of pain that are being removed), mostly it is displaced, not dulled. That being said, everyone’s experience with cannabis is uniquely different because cannabis unlike other products is geared to YOUR endocannabinoid system, how much your body absorbs, other medications you are on (or alcohol, tobacco, etc), how much you are taking, etc. There is no one size fits all when it comes to cannabis, which is why the drug companies have such a hard time trying to make it into a ‘drug’ they can sell. Marinol is synthetic and it is not a good comparison to how cannabis feels. I think a fair question is, “Does it work?” The answer is, “yes” for 70% of those who try it for severe pain. How long does THC stay in the body? Is CBD legal in the US? How much is 100 mg of THC? Is CBD legal in PA? Is there THC in poppy seeds? My answer does pertain to a 2:1, but I am currently using a 1:1 CBD to THC softgel and I gotta tell you, it's an out-of-body experience at times. You get all of the good effects of both cannabinoids. Your pain will most likely disappear or be dulled for the duration of the high, sort of like an Indica but without the drowsines associated with it; this treatment of pain can be both mental and a physical. You will find the pain relieving properties of CBD very satisfying, and the THC will give a mild cerebral high with a general sense of well-being. If you can get your hands on the strain you refer to, I wholeheartedly recommend that you do so at your earliest convenience! Dreamy, euphoric, and relaxing according to my husband. It really depends on the strain, but in general a 2:1 ratio of cbd to thc will be pretty mellow, without any of the paranoia, since cbd downregulates the psychoactive effects of thc. Hope that helps!
PeakAir if you are a home user, i would suggest Peakair because they are the only ISP who provides 4 mbps unlimted traiff in kochi. Peakair provide service in selected areas only… you can try your luck Asianet for the less fortunate, 2 mbps unlimted at 999 + tax ,that would sum around 1100 per month. They aslo provide different reasonable traiff (100gb 4mbps for 699).But asianet have the worst customer service .Connection stability depends with region. Bsnl Placed in the list only because they are the only broadband service providers left with wired connection. Airtel Jio Docomo provides speed upto 100mbps but basicaly wireless and costly

IFS stands for independent front suspension. As the name implies, it provides freedom to the wheels on the front of the vehicle to move vertically independent of each other. The wheels that are connected by beams can only move vertically as far as the other wheel permits. It is just like see-saw. When the wheel on right goes up, the wheel on left goes down as a reaction and restricts the height to which the right wheel can go up. McPherson strut is an example of independent suspension. Just like ifs, there are irs as well, independent rear suspension. Hope this helps.
Bodhidarma was a Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th/6th century and is traditionally credited as the leading patriarch and transmitter of Zen (Chinese: Chan, Sanskrit: Dhyana) to China. He was the third son of a Tamil king of the Pallava Dynasty. According to Chinese legend, he also began the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolinquan. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th century qigong manual known as the Yijin Jing. Little contemporary biographical information on  Bodhidharma  is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend, but some accounts state that he was from a Brahman family in southern India and possibly of royal lineage.However Broughton (1999:2) notes that Bodhidharma's royal pedigree implies that he was of the Kshatriya warrior caste. Mahajan (1972:705–707) argued that the Pallava dynasty was a Tamilian dynasty and Zvelebil (1987) proposed that Bodhidharma was born a prince of the Pallava dynasty in their capital of Kanchipuram[4] Scholars have concluded his place of birth to be Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, India. After becoming a Buddhist monk, Bodhidharma traveled to China. The accounts differ on the date of his arrival, with one early account claiming that he arrived during the Liú Sòng Dynasty (420–479) and later accounts dating his arrival to the Liáng Dynasty (502–557). Bodhidharma was primarily active in the lands of the Northern Wèi Dynasty (386–534). Modern scholarship dates him to about the early 5th century. Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian. He is described as "The Blue-Eyed Barbarian" in Chinese texts. The Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall (952) identifies Bodhidharma as the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in an uninterrupted line that extends all the way back to the Buddha himself. D.T. Suzuki contends that Chán's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had "no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism" and that Chán historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.

Yes. Under the FLSA and other federal laws, an employer can, in fact, require employees to work more than 40 hours in a workweek, and can even discipline or terminate employees for refusing to do so. The FLSA does not establish the number of hours that an employer can require employees to work in a given day or week, only that the employer provides overtime pay for hours worked beyond 40 hours in a workweek. Many people believe they are entitled to overtime pay if they put in more than eight hours a day, which is incorrect. The FLSA threshold is based on the workweek, not the workday – although some states require overtime pay for hours in excess of eight hours a day.
Elvis is not hated. The attendance at  Graceland is about 600,000 people per year . The only other private residence in the US toured more is the White House - and that is not exactly private. Has the numerous tribute artists and look-alike acts turned his image into a caricature? Sure, but the sheer number of such performances still indicates a certain level of appreciation. Was USA Today wrong in naming Houzz as the company of the year? Why do people in the USA hate the DMV so much? How would Elvis react to today's music? What would happen if the USA declared war on the UK today? Why do people hate Justin Bieber? Oh my! Elvis is not hated! Elvis remains a hugely popular figure both as a musician, an actor, and just for his popular image. Graceland (his home) is a very popular attraction, there are all Elvis channels on XM Radio, and every year around his birthday there are Elvis film festivals on cable TV.
Informal: “Toma” for one person, “tomen”, for 2 or more, in Latin America. The equivalent in plural in Spain would be “tomad” but I’m not sure about its usage. It means “take [it]” Formal: “Tome” (1 person), “tomen” (2 or more). “Toma” is a little bit rude, I’m convinced there is another common way, but I can’t remember it now. Other way is more similar to English: “Aquí/ahí tienes” (informal, singular), “… tienen” (plural, Latin America), “…teneis (informal, plural, Spain). I’ve read it and heard it in Mexican telenovelas, but it is not a common way in Chile. How do you say ‘I will pay it in one go’ or ‘I will pay the whole thing’ in Spanish? How do you say hi in Spanish? In Spanish, how do you say "so"? How do you say "187" in Spanish? How do I say hello in Spanish? In general, we use the verb “ tomar ”. Toma : You singular (informal). Tomen : You plural. Tome : You singular (respect). In stores, for example, when getting your  change  back, you may hear: “Aquí/ahí tiene/s/n su-s/tu-s/su-s  vuelto-s ”. Instead of tener, we also use:  estar . “Aquí/ahí  está / n  tu-s/su-s vuelto-s”. The use of  aquí  (close) and  ahí  (far) depends on the relative perception of the speaker and it really does not make a difference. ________________ Un poco de aire. “Aquí tiene / tienes.” “Aquí está.”

When you're really an hacker. When you have already learned hacking. Or having interest in hacking. You will also like maths and science. But is it really required? Not really. But love maths and science they are the fundamentals. I'm an certified ethical hacker. I love maths and science they way how it works in our daily life. But I didn't apply any maths or science while hacking. School math is good enough. No you don't really need to be good at maths or science to be a good hacker.
To be honest, it declines with every refusal. This isn't a matter of law or policy, but the perceptions of the consular officer. The best thing you can do is wait, travel to some other countries, and otherwise improve yourself as a visa applicant.
Yes. You have disconnected from your emotions in order to not feel the pain you were experiencing. It is common for survivors of  abuse . The best news is, as you heal, your emotions will return to normal. You will feel joy, happiness, anger, sadness, and all kinds of different emotions again. I haven’t written a blog post on this topic yet, but I did write a chapter in my book about my personal journey of beginning to feel safe enough to feel emotions again. I wish you the best luck as you heal. Healing takes courage, but it always worth it!
What can we do to our basics strong? First of all you need  interest.  There is a difference between clearing the basics and becoming strong in basics. You can be strong only if you are interested. You are asking about basics so I assume that right now you have no knowledge about the topic. So as you are very much interested, taking time to make a plan wouldn't bother you much right? Second thing to do -  make a plan. Getting help  is the third step. You can't do anything without help. So get help. Want to learn a new language? Join a language club online or offline. Want to learn football? Join a local football club. Want to learn physics? Get some good books or join a coaching centre. If you are fortunate enough to meet someone who is expert in that field, befriend him/her. Learn as much as you can from him/her. Well,this also a part of your planning. Fix a dead point.  It has many psychological benefits. As you have not specified anything particular. I gave you some generalised guidelines for making you basics strong about anything.
In the US, this varies a lot by discipline, but broadly, there are five paths: Bachelor’s at one institution, Master’s at a second, Ph.D. at a third Bachelor’s at one institution, Ph.D. at a second Bachelor’s and Master’s at one institution (often called a “5-year program”), Ph.D. at second Bachelor’s at one institution, then apply to and enter the Ph.D. program at a second but earn a Master’s degree along the way such that you earn both your Master’s and Ph.D. there (in this case, the Master’s is often called “non-terminal”). When you successfully defend your Master’s thesis in this plan, you automatically progress into the Ph.D. program. Bachelor’s at one institution, Master’s at a second, but the most successful Master’s students are invited to continue on into the Ph.D. program at that same school. Uninvited students have the option to apply elsewhere. Of these approaches, #4 is probably the most common in the US. It does vary a lot by country, though - the European model is dramatically different. All of them will have you in school for roughly 4 years taking Bachelor’s-level content, 2 years taking Master’s-level content and writing your thesis, and 3-years taking doctoral-level content and writing your dissertation. So the total time you spend is roughly the same regardless of path. That’s important to note, because in path #2, you still take “Master’s level” classes - you just don’t get a degree (although you also usually don’t need to write a Master’s thesis). Can I skip a masters and do a phd after my degree in the Uk? Should I get my PhD in CS after a Bachelor’s? Do you think that a PhD should be of a fixed duration, like a bachelor’s or a master’s degree? What are my chances to get into a master's program in biomedical engineering at ETH Zurich? Can I apply straight for a PhD after a bachelor's?... Can I do Masters Degree after PhD? This is the norm in the US. In other countries, you’d be required to do a master’s before you start your PhD (although some programs have an integrated master’s/PhD program).
That depends. When you did your Comp. Sci. degree, did you take any EE electives or additional EE courses? In the first place I imagine it would be harder for someone with a CS degree to get an EE position than it would be for someone with an EE degree. If you are already done with your CS degree and do not plan to go back for an EE undergrad or go for a masters, I would advise researching and making sure you understand the fundamentals of EE before applying for any EE job. So that is the first thing. The second thing is we're talking about Intel here. I would imagine a company like intel would require a bachelors degree in electrical engineering from an accredited university in order to work as an EE. In your position I would get as much experience as I can working as an EE at another company so you have some experience before you go after something as big as Intel. Best of luck, NC
You mean like how Google open sourced  Android This is what happened when Google open sourced Android, it got better with constant developer support from around the world. Although there is always the chinese knock offs, Google maintained a central dominating architecture because all the developers contributed on their repository. It also allows other hardware companies the collaborate and build the operating system growth. Open source also ofcourse leads to exploits and jailbreaks, but since it's open source more developers can identify them and fix. I think if Apple and Microsoft open sourced their operating systems I think ultimately the users would have more features and a better experience. Their operating systems would be more perfect and more growth based. Why hasn't any company been able to create a non-open source operating system to compete with Microsoft's Windows? Which company will fall first: Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, or Microsoft? Is any open source software included in the Microsoft Windows series of operating systems? Is Microsoft Windows 10 basically a spying operating system? Why are there no open source car operating systems? Google pretty much already open-sourced their OS. Microsoft and Apple on the other hand would lead to a lot more hacks because the code would be a lot lazier when nobody can see it. There was a huge SSL hack on all Apple devices a few years ago because some developer forgot to put brackets on an “if” statement so the last statement always ran and accepted any certificate. That’s something that would have been caught instantly by an open source community. It’s just better to start out as open sourced because it forces developers to be their best when you’re showing it to the whole world.
Thanks for A2A I am a die hard Bahubali fan, but this scene does leaves a bad taste. Stalking is glorified in many movies and it's high time to stop it. Even worse is when real nutjobs get inspired by these scenes and imitate them in real life with often terrible consequences. What are some of the mind-blowing facts about the Baahubali movie? What are the lessons learned from Baahubali 2? What is the release date of the Baahubali 2 movie? Is the end of the movie Baahubali justified? Is Baahubali 2 a good film? Good question indeed. I felt the same way, though did like the out of the box thinking and creative expression behind it.  Undressing a woman is certainly not justifiable, whatever or however the motive behind it be.  Besides, what irked me apart from it is that the whole scene and some of its related predecessors only emphasized ‘the set rules for how a woman should be’. It portrayed this undying psyche of people to define ways of living or being a certain way for women. Why can’t women not care how they look or what they wear and only focus on their wants? Why should they always be charming, or rather ‘feminine’ as defined by the society.  Didn’t this scene narrate the same, or is it just me who felt it this way? Very Good Question!!! I saw many people in Quora talking about the below scene. There are many comments about this scene stating ‘excellent’ ‘fantastic’ ‘spectacular’. Some said Bahubali is movie on women empowerment. But no one talked about the scene where Prabhas removes Thamannah clothes I say it(Bahubali) is yet another masala movie which tell if hero touches heroine without her permission then it is cool!!! Same did by any villan or side-role so un-cool. I request audience please dont judge a movie by a single scene. Analyse complete movie. PS: Im a big fan of Bahubali. Except that particular scene. Cheers!! :) There is nothing wrong over there. Avantika (Tamannah) is mature enough to stop Shivudu while removing the clothes but she didn’t. The reason may be she has some interest over Shivudu and allowed him to do so. Coming to the conclusion part, that is completely wrong behaviour towards a married woman and meanwhile they are hesitating to be done like that and Anushka well reacted. Moral : If both sides are Okay, there shouldn’t be a third person Involvement. Let them do what they wanted to do. P.S Loved the Movie the way it is. No objections. @Abdul Rashid - Lol, There goes some secret consent from Avantika. If what you think is correct, Can’t Avantika Deal the scene when a guy tries to rape her? Atleast can’t she push him away? I better suggest watch the movie with feel. Btw Maturity is not what you think, it’s what everyone feels. No argument.
For anger management, no tricks of management works. It is more the issue of deep within layers called chittah. You can chant the mantras of five elements and nature (which are part of your actual personality) You can say, Om Lam Namaha - Earth Element Matnra Om Vam Namaha - Water Om Ramm Namaha - Fire Om Yamm Namaha - Air Om Hamm Namaha - Space Om Prakriti Namaha ( Nature) You can recognize these cosmic energies and say hell to them and respect them (by chanting their names. Religions call it manatras but technically they are just remembering the names of those energies and saying namaste or respects to them) . So you can chant these mantras anytime anywhere in mind. Initially it is a warm up exercise of cleansing of five elements within you which are fundamental channels for mind and soul. So by chanting these mantras, the five elements, mind, intellect, chittah , ego and few other layers of the soul get cleansed. The energies get balanced within your personality and that is how the anger gets settled down. All the best wishes Loves Krishna Is heroin the best feeling in the world? What are some tips to reduce the anger of my boss? Does hate beget anger, or anger begets hate? Both my parents are killers. I feel dirty, and I can’t look at them the same way anymore without feeling sick. How do I move past this? What are the tips for increasing anger? Everyone knows, that taking a deep breath, and counting to five, gives us more control of our emotions. For the rest, knowledge generally helps. Repetition trains and conditions the brain, whether we want it to, or not. Therefore, if you get into the habit of taking deep breaths, every time you get upset, then it will become natural. Next - All negative emotions and behavior evolved, because they generate an endless stream of dominant behavioral displays, which play a key role, in our selection of mates. From the moment babies gain control of their limbs, they throw them out wide, into the air. This impulse is genetically programmed behavior. Unless something negative occurs, the behavior is rewarded. Google brain chemical rewards (serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin). To a great degree, these chemicals determine human behavior. The exception: When there are no good choices, then we choose the least negative outcome. Whatever behavior you observe in the world, unless it results in a negative outcome, then it is rewarded. The reward makes it a learned behavior. We live in a materialistic world, because showing dominance and accumulating wealth raises our status. Individuals with high status are able to attract high status mates, which improves the odds of survival, of their offspring. Just for attempting to raise our status, the brain rewards us. If it didn’t, then we would never attempt anything. We give a bunch of idiots the power to make us miserable, with their hurtful words and hurtful actions. The idiots don’t even know, why they’re doing it. Subconsciously, they’re trying to raise their status, by lowering yours. All of the above, is part of our primitive, 1.0 human operating system. If you learn to control/manage your emotions, then you will upgrade to 2.0. By being able to think, rather than react, you will have many more options, in which to respond to the world. Your status will rise above 99% of the world’s population, and your brain will reward you. You will become smarter, more productive, and happier. If your brain is receptive to this, then it will automatically, gradually reduce the amount of chemical reward, for your negative emotions, and behavior. Factors which slow the process: Testosterone, stress, conflict, and greed. The brain rewards memories/thoughts of fear, pain, anger, guilt, shame, and humiliation. If it didn’t, then we would shun such thoughts. If we never remembered them, then we would make many more bad choices. We would continue to make the same mistakes, over and over again. If a negative memory persists, then write it down in a journal, and make a solemn commitment to read it, once a month. By organizing and regulating the memory, the subconscious will gradually reduce the amount of chemical reward. A U.K. study on the long term effects, of having a rabbit in a elementary school, classroom: Grades improved, and behavioral problems decreased. However, there were negative side effects. Rabbits get sick, and they die. Then you can’t teach the kids. A different school used potted plants, instead. They got very similar results. Why? Because the teacher used, assigning care of the plants, as a reward for improved behavior, and for improved grades. At the beginning of the class, the teacher called out the full name of the two students, responsible for the care of the plants. This enhanced the chosen student’s status. Control your fear, let go of the anger. Fear leads to anger leads to hate leads to suffering. Face your fears, become selfless, try having compassion and love for self and others alike. Fear and greed are roots of all evil, becomes selfless and fearless. Nip the evil in the bud. Seek inner peace.
It all depends on what you  really believe.  I believe in Law of Attraction in the universe. So this how it works: Positive energy (or positivity) in you will attract positive energy from the universe while negative energy (or negativity) in you will attract negative energy from the universe. This is not as simple as it sounds. Not only should your actions be positive (or good) but also should your thoughts be. Feelings like anger and revenge will defeat the purpose. Now, be patient till the universe does wonders as i believe it will. It may take some time but it surely would.. provided , you do not doubt it. You would  eventually  feel good being done to you. Your goodness will eventually come back to you and you would never regret being so good and positive. So if you  really believe  in the universe's ability to do so and you do not doubt it, it would  eventually  prove itself. I know this sounds philosophical but again…this is what  I  believe… What are some good ways to get revenge on someone? Do animals have memory of harm done to them and can they take revenge on the harm? Is taking a revenge on someone a good thing or a bad one? Is revenge is a good thing? What are some good ways to get revenge on a large company? It's not good. You may hurt the wrong person. Then you have caused the innocent to suffer. Here's an example: Man charged in grandmother's murder at Harlem barbecue In that story someone was angry because his jewelry was stolen. He thought he saw the thief and fired his gun at the person. He missed and ended up killing a grandmother. If the grandmother's family decides that his punishment isn't enough and tries to get revenge then where will it all end? If you are alive and have a future then let go of resentment and vengeful thoughts. Do the right thing for its own sake and enjoy life as much as you can. As they say, “living well is the best revenge.”
This depends greatly on the country, but for a variety of complex reasons, CS is the queen of the computing fields. That doesn’t mean that it’s better, just that it’s perceived to be better. At the same time, in the US market, if you have a degree in computing and know how to program, it’s relatively easy to get started, and once you are started, your field is not overly significant. If you can easily switch to study CS, then it’s probably worthwhile, if one for prestige, as stupid as that sounds. However, if this would involve multiple additional years of school (or leaving school), then it’s not worth the effort; you should graduate and get employed ASAP. Again, my bias is the US system, so you need to get a more local perspective. I have a choice between studying B.Sc Physics and a B.E degree of my choice. Which should I choose? If most ECE majors ending doing software, why not major in CS? How do CS and CIS degrees compare when applying for a software engineering job? I have one degree of bachelors in engineering (B.E.) and now I want to pursue bachelors in environmental science (B.Sc.). Is it beneficial? Can I do a B.Sc degree after engineering? How would studying physics be relevant at all? I don't understand what's not obvious about this comparison?
Consumption of glucose powder is not good for health because it is pure carbohydrate in its pure form. As you must be knowing that balanced diet is good for health and any component in excess is bad for health. By taking glucose, you are just talking carbohydrate, when it be used up by body it will provide energy to muscles but muscles needs protein for strength, without which the muscles will start breaking. So ultimately glucose will do more harm than good. Excessive glucose needs more Insulin, that means more pressure on pancreas. Excessive glucose also gets converted into fat in body and is stored in body and it can cause obesity. Does horse meat cause any health issues? What causes a stringy spit, and is it a sign of a health issue? What are the benefits and side effects of Glucon-D? Is mixing ORS and glucose for daily consumption bad for health? Is Glucon-D good for the liver? Most of your food items and drinks already contains more than required sugar and if still you are taking Glucon D on a daily basis, then it certainly will increase the sugar level. Increased sugar level is directly linked with diabetes, so it has to be limited. But it is good for like 10 times a month or so, but definitely not recommended for a daily basis.
Do not ruin the magic of your first Disney World experience by marrying yourself to a specific vision of what you will do and how it will be. I think it’s probably fair to say that very few people come back from Disney World and say: “Eh, it wasn’t all that. I really don’t see what the fuss is about.” However, I think it can be a pretty common experience for newbies to read blogs, buy books, listen to their friends’ must-do recommendations, and build themselves an expectation that it is impossible for reality to live up to. This might apply to the whole trip, or more commonly to particular experiences such as a character meal or a trip to Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique. They still have a great time in the end, but the special dinner or activity that they planned is marred from what it could have been by their [temporary] disillusionment that the expectation didn’t match up to reality. Or, they read that planning is essential to a successful trip to Disney World, and they make a great master plan, and then they  stick to that plan, goshdarnit,  even when they see things that they might want to do that aren’t in the plan — and that they might prefer to the things that are in the plan — because  this is the plan.  I know, it sounds really silly when I put it that way, but people do do this, even sensible people. They get caught up in the amount of effort that went into preparation, and forget that in the end it is satisfaction with the experience that should be the metric and not how well you stuck to the plan. Don’t get me wrong — I’m not saying not to plan. I do think it’s possible to have a terrific first trip without any planning, as long as you take the attitude that you will be thrilled with everything that you are doing and shake off anything that you find is unattainable due to lack of planning. But a little planning can go a looong way, even if it is just looking up the most popular rides in each park and making Fastpasses for those in advance. It’s also worth mentioning that planning is a way to build anticipation, and for many people anticipation is part of the enjoyment of a vacation. So keeping that in mind, here are my recommendations for how to plan and anticipate your first trip: Take the measure of yourself and use resources that are available to decide how much planning is right for you and that you know the areas where planning can have the maximum effect. Keep in mind that one person’s must-do is another person’s totally missable experience. Of course you should listen to other people’s recommendations, but with the following caveats: This might be something that sounds like fun to  them , but from listening to their rough description, does it sound like fun  to you? Even if you decide to do it, remember that you may not have the same experience they did. Keep in mind that there is absolutely no way that you will be able to do all the things that people will tell you that you must do while you are at Disney World. It would be like trying to eat at every restaurant that serves a wonderful pasta dish on a trip to Rome. Don’t stress yourself out by trying to cram in as many must-do’s as you possibly can, instead pick just a few and make sure to enjoy them to the hilt. Quality over quantity. Keep in mind that planning for logistics can have as much or more value than planning specific activities — not bringing the right clothing so that you end up hot, sweaty, and miserable can affect your trip to a far greater extent than simply finding that Space Mountain is closed on the day you are visiting the Magic Kingdom. Blogs can help a lot with this, and I wrote an answer here that you may find useful as well:  Jennifer Edeburn's answer to What are some tips for parents to survive a long day at Disney World? Finally, after you’ve done some planning and moved on to the anticipation, don’t make your daydreams too detailed. Instead of focusing on a specific vision of how a particular experience will go, focus on your excitement over the newness of it, your anticipation of an event that is partly a mystery. If your only high expectation is that whatever you are trying will be fun and enjoyable, it is usual that Disney does not disappoint. What are some tips for visiting Disney World?

Please talk to your child’s pediatrician. It may be as simple as changing something in the diet, or it might require an ointment or cream you could apply (good luck with that with a toddler). None other than a physician can tell you what you need to do. Good luck.
The question is a common one. It’s helpful to understand if  they  understand your expectations of them. For example, if you are providing remote assistance to them via phone, email or some other online method, you could set expectations by: creating a single place for all documentation, to avoid the back-and-forth, and to stop them living out of their inbox; and setting a fixed time each week (or every two weeks) when you meet. Also, if their unreliability is to do with payment (sounds like it), then kill off any payments that are post the work. In other words, ask for 100% up front, negotiated down to 50% if they push back. If they don’t trust you, then you’re not a good fit. If this is a services-based business, ask yourself whether you are seriously undercharging. This can scare away more up-market and reliable clients, while attracting lower-priced clients who make a habit of being unreliable. How should I deal with very finicky clients? How can I deal with unreasonable client? How do you deal with clients that tell you to follow up next quarter? How did you deal with irate and furious SEO clients? How do I deal with bad clients those who do not pay money on time? You make sure you are covered, as in not advancing or paying funds ahead of work slated to be done. You get written agreements on any projects that are supposed to be done… clearly stating what work is to be done, and by whom. If it’s a big ticket project (involving a lot of money), even getting a lawyer involved wouldn’t be out of the question. And, you make sure that other people are aware of, and know the specifics of the project, so it’s not just your word against the clients about what was agreed on. Then, if they still don’t follow through… you drop them, collect whatever payment is due (as spelled out by the written agreement…signed by both parties), and don’t deal with them again.
There is no cut off as such. The counselling depends on opening and closing ranks and goes on subsequently till the seats are filled. Don't lose hopes. All the best. PS: GETTING A SCORE >235 WOULD ALMOST CONFIRM A SEAT DEPENDING ON THE LAST TWO YEAR SCENARIO. There is no cut off. Opening and closing ranks are decided for each branch. I got a general rank around 400 (I don't know the exact number sorry for that) with 270 marks. So this data can help you to some extent. P.S.: With a rank around 450 you will get any branch you opt for.
Actually, you can never be sure. The market is very volatile. Its trend is unpredictable. Even the stocks that has been going steady upwards can suddenly plunge down in a blink. If you are looking for these kinds of investments, I suggest you try to make it more realistic. Aim for stocks with consistent and steady profits instead of those that shoot upwards at once. Take a look at Snapchat. After its IPO, their stocks had trended upwards really fast, but the market has realized this mistake and started to correct its stock value. If you really want to secure profits, look for stocks that are less volatile. The stocks on the products that you are sure people will continue to use for years after. Buy these and forget about them for a long time. After some years, you may not notice but you could have generated a whole lot of earnings.

First of all, there exists no such concept as  scientific proof . Science does not deal in proof. Proof is a concept that is useful in mathematics and formal logic. Science evaluates evidence to build theories that explain observed phenomena. Second, I have never seen a scientific theory that speaks of male and female brain types, let alone gestational hormones being responsible for brain types. Your details simply confuse me in the third part. Sexual preference? Do you mean orientation? Attraction? Are you suggesting that sexual orientation has something to do with “male and female brain types?” So far as I am aware, no evidence exists that male or female brain types exist, other than insofar as sex-unique physiologies are “wired” to the brain in obvious ways. Nor am I aware of any evidence that suggests that gestational hormones are responsible for creating so-called male or female brain types. Ladies: What would you do if you were in a male body for one day? How likely is it that the "theory of evolution" is legit? What evidence makes it superior to all other ideas? If the theory isn't true, then w... Is there any scientific evidence proving a gut brain connection? What if the brains of a male and female were swapped? How would he or she respond or act? What if a male brain was put into a female? What would happen? Well we know male and female brains have developmental differences well before birth, starting at 26 weeks. But I’m not sure how much of this is homorines specifically. Obviously genetics plays a role. Prenatal sex differences in the human brain We also know that boys produce more testosterone in the womb, and have behavioral differences in the first day of life. Obviously brain structure is likely influenced, but to what extent, I don't know. But I'll have to look up more information about the hormones specifically.

The appointments made by the President are in essence actually made by the cabinet of India. It is the cabinet which ‘suggests' a suitable candidate for a position to the President and the President merely appoints that person to the job. The appointments made in the name of President include the Governors of states, ambassadors to other countries, ministers in the council of ministers, chiefs of defence services and public commissons etc. The appointments made by the Central Government are actually decided by it. It is the government which first decides and then appoints. The ministry level appointments are made by the concerned Minister while interministerial posts are filled after decision by the cabinet.

Respiration accomplishes gas exchange with the environment: Oxygen (O2) is taken into the body and distributed to every cell in the body, while carbon dioxide (CO2) is removed from every cell and exhaled to the exterior of the body. Without respiration, which for terrestrial animals (including humans) requires breathing + circulation, the cells cannot function. Do people need nitrogen to breathe/live? If breatharians live off prana, why do they need to breathe air? How can you treat yourself if you need to force your breathing? When there is more oxygen in the air, do we need to breath less? How long can a little girl hold her breath? A2A. The cellular respiration that happens in our bodies require oxygen and produce a waste product mainly in the form of CO2. We inhale to bring in fresh O2 and we exhale to blow off CO2.
Work first, designation later.Its only work that should define the designation in the truest sense possible. Yes, of course designation is important for career progression, yet its the struggle and the work that should do justice at all times.
Both. Some things deteriorate with time. Some things deteriorate withdistance and or engine time on which is related to miles. If I let a friend drive 850 miles in my car, how much should I charge for gas and wear and tear? Is it better to buy an old used car with low mileage or a newer used car with high mileage? What is a good car mileage limit? What is the average MPG for the Ford F350? How can I measure the mileage of a 15-year-old car? A little bit of both. Mileage will add a lot of maintenance to the scheduled routine, but a lot of things break down over time. I got a ’96 Maxima from my mother, recently. Really had no value, but the mileage was only about 60k, which is only 3,000mi/year! Even so, the control arm bushings are done, the water pump was just replaced, the radiator developed a crack, and the timing chain needs to be replaced. Also, the Bose radio went. The car is absolutely clean and perfect, but things tend to go after some time. You left out one very important variable. Driving habits. Did the owner maintain the vehicle at all or drive it like a bloody maniac for a short period of time? I have seen cars totally baffed after three years because that was when the warranty of the lease ran out. I have also seen cars in pristine shape and running order after 30 years and nt owned by a collector, but the original owner.
are you searched for definition of linear network?? it is normal circuit with fixed constant RLC ,RL,RC,R,CL,L,C any kind of load now what is behaviour that this much % voltage drope, %current diverted in parallel path, etc etc if load change change is only amount of current or voltage not percentage of v or i if you drow graph it will remain in same sape only value can be big or small, that's it What does resistivity of a wire depend upon? Why does the current always remain the same in a series circuit? If the frequency of the EMF source in an AC circuit is F, the power varies with what frequency? Why can’t we put a current source in a series with a voltage source in a circuit? What are linear and non-linear circuits? I think your definition of Linear networks is not usual! Because linear circuits contains capacitors and inductors too along with resistors. And the output of the circuit changes with the change in input source type. For example, the circuit behave differently with a sine wave voltage and differently with a square wave input and differently with pure DC. A time-independent elements is one for which we can plot an i/v curve. The current is only a function of the voltage, it does not depend on the rate of change of the voltage. We can see that capacitors and inductors are not time-independent elements. Time-independent elements are often called resistive elements. Note that we often have a time dependent signal applied to time independent elements. This is fine, we only need to analyze the circuit characteristics at each instance in time. Linearity A function f is linear if for any two inputs x1 and x2 f(x1+x2)=f(x1)+f(x2) Resistive circuits are linear. That is if we take the set {xi} as the inputs to a circuit and f({xi}) as the response of the circuit, then the above linear relationship holds. The response may be for example the voltage at any node of the circuit or the current through any element. Any Linear circuit has its own characteristics and the response of it for given input would be fixed. The circuit won’t behave differently only the response would depend purely on the nature of input.
This question flabbergasted me. Taking a look at  The Pros and Cons of Off-Campus Lunch  and reading between the lines, it is certainly not illegal for high schools to allow students off their premises per se. But schools do have their own rules (as opposed to laws) that they expect to be obeyed. For example, one of the rules at my school was no smoking on school premises. Although inevitably some kids did behind the bike-sheds, apparently others would congregate just outside a certain entrance… along with teachers! That wouldn’t happen nowadays in the same way, but I have seen teachers smoking (somewhat discretely, at least) during a fire drill, quite recently. Schools act  in loco parentis.  This term applies specifically to schools, although also to legal guardians of children. Is it illegal for parents to let high schoolers grab a bite to eat outside of the home? To be honest I doubt it. Can schools be held to a higher standard of discipline than when parents are unable to be at home at lunch? Yes, of course they can and will. Are lawmakers going say “We will punish with the full force of the law any school which ever allows a student off their premises for lunch”? I just don’t see it happening, anywhere in the world (North Korea excluded). Rules are better than laws when dealing with underaged students. For what it is worth, some shops near my house are even nearer to a school (less than a minute to walk). One is a bakery, another sells sweets. They have signs up saying “no more than  x  pupils in the shop at a time”, where  x  is something like 4. This is not in NYC, obviously, nor in the USA, but it isn’t exactly as if the school isn’t aware of these policies by the shopkeepers. In summary,  you  may run the risk of being punished by the rules your school has, but the school is at no serious risk of falling foul of the law. Middle and High School Students: What is the most underrated problem in the life of a teenager today? Can a high schooler get trouble for selling an essay? How can a high schooler make a lot of money? How can a high schooler make $500 in a week? What are cool cars high schoolers can get? Students should be allowed to go outside of school for lunch. This is important because not a lot of students actually like the lunch food that public schools supply us with. Actually 9/10 students would eat something else besides lunch food if they had a choice. It's not healthy, or sanitary. If the city cares so much about us as students, why not let us all go out for lunch? Being a teen, food becomes really important to us. Our bodies change, our apetite changes. School lunch for the most part, a lot of us don't eat. There are reasons like, it doesn't hold you for the rest of the day, etc. Say I eat school lunch, probably like the period after, I'd get hungry yet again because not only do they limit the lunch food, but it's not enough for most of our apetities. If we get hungry, the hungrier we get, the more distracted we will be during classes. Which will distract other students. It's like a domino effect! Also, The DOE would probably save a lot of money. Like I've mentioned before, Not a lot of students value the lunch food provided by the school. If all high school students were allowed to leave campus to pick up some lunch, that money that would of gone in the school lunch could of been used for something the school and the students in the school would value. Like new sports gear, better seats and tables etc. We sit in classrooms ALL day. No sunlight, no freshair. Just the captivity of some grey walls and a hallway cramped up constantly with other people. Taking a break from the school, the odors, the captivity would be gradually appriciated. Refreshing our minds before the next few classes would really help us probably focus more, be in a happier environment. It would really, really benefit us. These are just a few basic reasons as to why high school students should be allowed to leave campus for lunch. It would help the community inside of the school, us as students. Even the teachers. Not having to deal with students constantly complaining about disgusting school lunch, and how hungry they are can really add up a lot don't you think? In Austin, you can't, unless you are signed out by a legal guardian who is 18 or older. That means a senior could sign you out, right? No. They can only sign you out in an emergency. Also, a senior can sign themselves out for lunch if they're 18. At my school, as long as you have off campus privileges you can go out for lunch. Basically as long as you're a junior or senior and haven't done anything against school rules (cheating, fighting, etc.)
Always trust your gut feeling. You don’t even have to go by your gut feeling at this point—he’s shown you legitimate evidence when he cursed at his friends and would keep hitting things; not to mention there’s legal evidence that this guy’s no good, he physically fought his mom and sister. If you don’t feel safe then it’s not worth it. You didn’t go into detail about your relationship, so I am not sure whether or not you’ve only started seeing him, or if it’s official. But with a guy like this, I’d either end it via *text (honestly the ideal option) or through a phone call, or as a very  very  last resort in a busy, public place where people can see you. Be sure that you have a safe place to go to afterwards, or you’re around safe people while doing this. He’ll probably get angry and he may try to emotionally manipulate you. *I don’t usually recommend text break ups, but when you’re dealing with a person like him who’s not emotionally healthy, text or phone call break ups are the safest option for you Is it right to trust your gut feelings when it comes to love? Do you trust your gut and why or why not? Why are my "gut feelings" usually right? Is this the same for others? Should I follow my gut feeling if I think a guy likes me? Have you ever had a bad feeling about someone and been right? You had a gut feeling - always listen to your intuition. Fine tune it, be more aware. Then you had his words . ‘ He told me he had emotional problems’  More back up to your intuition. Although you should have listened at the first, now you have very good reason to run Now you have violent and abusive actions that are concrete proof of your intuition What are you waiting for? Do you need him to assault you? Perhaps your murder to be plastered on the local news? For heaven’s sake girl! Run. Run like the wind. Never look back. Block him everywhere, and take affirmative legal actions should he start stalking you. And learn from this experience. Never be so desperate for a man (or anybody else for that matter) that you forget to preserve your personal integrity. Yes, what you are describing far exceeds the warning of a gut feeling because you have direct observation of factual actions and behaviors, more than enough information/ evidence to know that this person is TOXIC beyond a shadow of a doubt. Do not mistake his openness by telling you that he has emotional problems as honesty, sincerity or vulnerability. He is telling you this so that you will feel sympathy for him, experience his behavior as common routine and then eventually accept his behavior because that is “just” how he is, after all he told you, ( warned you ) and you stayed so what's the problem….right? Get out of the relationship, you will not be able to change this person and you will sacrifice all aspects of your life if you try. He told who he was, he showed you who he was, you witnessed his “true colors”… what more evidence do you need to understand that he is dangerous. Are you waiting for him to be physically violent with you before you decide what to do. You do not owe this individual any explanation, think of yourself, you are your number one priority. Save yourself and eradicate this individual from your life. Girl, do you have guarantee that he won’t beat you ? A man who can beat his mother and sister can definiately beat his wife. Your gut feeling is absolutely correct.
GM is certainly not exiting India. It has decided to exit Indian market.Recently it has consolidated its operation to Talegaon facility. Analysing why it has decided to leave such a hot market would need a multi pronged approach/ GM was always keen on quality of its products,and keeping market competent in India ,where we find another car in every Rs10000 price range,was difficult.Perhaps this alongwith being not able to catch up with cut throat competition in market would have been reason for falling numbers. When numbers fall,dealers are not happy and they loose interest in selling the brand,equally affected are services. Services have a major stake while deciding which car to buy.With all stakes going negative it would have pushed the volumes down,unless there were more launches with aggressive marketing. This has to be analysed with upcoming BS6 norms in 3 4 years,upgrading would have required a huge amount of money,and with such low numbers it might not have been a good business to work out. GM as a brand is too big,but it seems in India they have given up the competition to big brothers who already lead in market. As a brand they have kept their promises of quality and customer satisfaction.And we can hope someday they will be back when they feel market is ready for them. How is work at General Motors? And what is it like to intern at General motors? (In India) General Motors has recently exited the Indian market. It's safe to assume that the prices will fall. So is it wise to buy these cars now? Do you think tesla motors will do well in India? India: Does one need an exit visa to exit India? Are General Motors 3.8 V6 good engines? GM is not exactly exiting India. It will stop selling cars in India. It has two assembly plants, out of these two it plans to sell its Halol plant. General Motors were unhappy with the share they were holding in the Indian automobile market i.e. almost around 1%, in the third fastest growing market in the world. So they decided to cut the marketing arm and stop selling but take advantage of cheap labor and keep one assembly plant to export.
Computer fundamentals gives us an insight into the underlying base - working of the computer, computer hardware, computer software and memory. Once you have knowledge about these basics, you could surely have a better and complete understanding of further concepts.
I believe that most people do not quarrel about their religion. In fact, i think most people actively try not to quarrel about their religion and only discuss the differences between various religions and religious interpretations in a civil manner. My agnostic- atheistic viewpoint: God might exist, but religion was man-made and never meant to be a source of conflict.
Friend, as you grow up you will start to feel that you are becoming more lonelier... But its only because you are tying to shut yourself down!!.. SO PLEASE DON’T!!.. Go out and meet other kids of your age.. Try your best to make new friends, its going to take a lot of patience.. We have to learn to take care of own our lives sooner or later and the earlier you start, the more time period you have to learn new stuff, make mistakes and correct them.. If you don’t put an effort, you are only wasting your own time.. If your cousin visits home during holidays, then go talk to him, ask him about his experience in college, you will actually become interested to go to college yourself!!.. Do youngest children commonly get depressed when all their older siblings leave the house? (For college, military etc.)? How do I prepare for my sibling leaving for college? How is growing up with a sibling different from being an only child? How do I cope up with failure in the JEE? What is it like to grow up without any siblings? This is a hard fact of life that you need to accept. The best way to cope is by developing a hobby like writing, learning painting, music, martial arts, gardening, cooking, etc that you really enjoy, that takes up a substantial amount of your time and lets you make new friends. As a school going person, with your tight schedule, you will not have time for anything else. Be the first to claim their bedroom when they are gone! Move closer to the head of the table at dinner! Claim their best SF books and rock albums when they leave for school! Any other good hand-me-downs you can fit into? Take over their chores and leave yours to the next youngest! Is there a boy/girlfriend left behind you can date? Perhaps you can take over the dog they care for. You are moving up in line and may be next - have you made any plans, yet?
Tsun zu said "That which depends on me, i can do ;tgat which depends on the enemy cannot be certain" He who excels at resolving difficulties does so before they arise. He who excels in conquering his enemies truimph before they materialize Chess is not simply a game. It’s a game of strategy. It’s similar to billiards ball game where one doesn’t have the control on opponents tactic. It’s a game of patience and pressure tactics, a hard core strategist , a mixed ball of defensive and offensive tactics. These tactics need to be calculative , strategic and calibrated risk. Each small move has an opposite repercussion. Each repercurssion has a major or minor effect. This effect is calculated and can be mobilised in an certain manner. Within the game , there are number of games. The sub game , that has the major effect is the effect is that of behaviourialism ., which kills the opponent, defeat the opponent without any move. This move. The reason why chess is given such an ultimate position is because of its uncertainty of which player would be winning. Its not about losing about a pawn or and player. The ultimate thing is the result . As a pawn can change itself to become a queen and quite similarly the change the whole dynamics of game. Thus you can never say that won the ultimate game unless you checkmate the player. Some ogf the characterstics that you need to follow You need to have a supra long defensive position so that you your king can never be at vulnerable position. Patience is one of the most important thing , that can frustrate the other player and make him do the mistake. The context. of this article us the increasing geo political, geo economic and geo strategic power game olayed between Each move is important and while moving each move you need to have the reason why you have put that move and secondly what would be the repercussion The next important thing is you need to know the pychology of the other player, what the other player wants to achieve. To sum up, chess provides tactics and strategies to have a realistic position of the enemy ir competitors. In the world of realisim and complex interdependence , india china is cooperaing and competiting at the same time. Geopolitics India china is not only cooperaing but at certain position have adverse stance. For ex there is a geo political turf in central asia , west asia, africa and more importantly south asia and south east asia. China is supporting taliban in Afghanistan and having a muscular stance in south east asia and also assertive in regional situation as well. The current scenario doesn't dole a peaceful stance for indo china relations in the near future. There is a possibility of increasing incursion at the border and assertion for arunachal pradesh . There are also evidence of china having a role in deteriorating the internal security situation in north east and also playing a second fiddle by supporting the fringe elements in Pakistan. It is important for India to assert itself stronger and should be cautious as Tsun su said' if you cannot nip his plans in the bud, or disrupt his alliances when they are about to be consummated, sharpen your weapons to gain the victory
Peroxides tend to whiten just about anything that they come in contact with.  Hydrogen peroxide is commonly included as a whitening ingredient in mouthwashes for this purpose.  (Examples:  Amazon.com: peroxide mouthwash ) Just rinsing your mouth with this liquid will have a subtle whitening effect.  That's the only step.  You'd have to do it more or less daily to see much of an effect. For stronger effects, you would want a thick gel, which allows you to ensure that it's just in contact with your teeth (not your entire mouth).  In that case, you should purchase a pre-made kit specifically designed for that purpose. Can I brush my teeth with hydrogen peroxide? Is it safe to use a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda as teeth whitener? Can hydrogen peroxide really whiten teeth? Is it safe to swish with hydrogen peroxide? Are there any health risks associated with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda teeth whitening? It is safe but you have to be careful. How to whiten teeth with hydrogen peroxide? Mix pharmacy hydrogen and baking soda. Put a few teaspoons of baking soda into a dish, then add 20 drops of 3.5% pharmacy hydrogen. Mix it until you get a thick paste. Then you can brush your teeth with a toothbrush or you can brush it with cotton wool instead. Brush your teeth for 3 minutes. Rinse the paste with water. Note : Be careful not to swallow hydrogen peroxide during the whitening process. You should immediately call your dentist or a doctor if this accidentally happens. Although there are many  ways to whiten your teeth at home using natural remedies , if you want to whiten your teeth faster, safely and more efficient, you should take into consideration some teeth whitening products. Best way to whiten teeth - top teeth bleaching products in 2017 Bleaching gel is a fairly inexpensive way for teeth whitening and is not difficult to find either. They are made from a peroxide solution and there are multiple ways to apply the same.  Some come with a bleaching tray that is put over the teeth. Or they can be applied to the teeth via a toothbrush. Another easy way is to use a bleaching pen to apply to the teeth directly.  It is easy to apply as it is a thick gel. Please do not eat or drink while the gel is on. It works best for minor stains or dull looking teeth. For heavier stains or discolorations, it is best to follow other remedies and not entirely depend on the gel. Also overuse of this is not good for gums.  There are host of other solutions, you can see this blogpost for more details -  Teeth whitening naturally and quickly! . It is true that hydrogen peroxide can be an effective teeth whitening solution. Peroxide is the key ingredient in most whiteners. This safe for the mouth bleaching agent form bubbles on enamel that lift away stains. The higher the concentration of peroxide and the longer you leave it on your teeth, the whiter that your teeth will get. Source:  Hollywood's Teeth Whitening Secrets - Cosmetic Dentist Not really, although it's commonly used in teeth whitening toothpastes, it takes quite a long time to see the results - from experience I'd say it took me around 5 months to see the results.  The chemical itself corrodes the surface of your teeth and can temporarily make them very sensitive. I recommend using teeth whitening toothpastes three times a week for 6 months. Good luck!
Because based on what you wanna be when you grow up, it might be very meaningful to you. You also might be just really wanted it. Why do people care so much about IQ scores? Why do we care so much about how we look? Why do people care so much about top 1%? Do women really care about how much money a guy makes or are they looking for stability? Why do people care so much about material things? I care about my class position in order to compete in small levels and have a good spirit to compete at higher levels in future.

no one should carry a fake passport. Word of warning: carrying a fake identification document of whatever nature is illegal in most places and could land you in jail, even if you don’t intend to use them. There’s a lot of reasons why someone would carry two passports. The most common, within the people I know, are: 1.- double nationality/citizenship. You may be a US citizen, for example, but your parents may be Italian. In cases such as this, you may be entitled to get an italian passport which doesn’t replace your american one but rather extends certain travel possibilities such as entering some countries without a Visa or Reciprocity fee using your italian passport, instead of the US passport which would require payment of a reciprocity fee (Argentina charges a 160 USD RF to US Citizens, but not to italian citizens, for example) The opposite also works: Argentinians need a US Visa to enter the US. Many Argentinians have italian ancestry and can lawfully obtain an italian passport, which they do because Italy is a Visa Waiver Program country. Travelling with an italian passport, Argentinians can enter the US under the VWP with just an ESTA form. 2.- current Visa on your expired passport. This is actually my case for a couple of countries, including the US. My still current US Visa (from the time nationals from my country needed a US Visa to enter as tourists) is stamped on one of my expired passports. Since I don’t travel under the Visa Waiver Program -why would I? I still have a Visa- I need to carry my current passport as a valid travel document and my expired passport in order to present the Visa to the CBP officer. In neither of the above cases any passport is a fake. Can I get to Alaska without a passport? Do fake passports really work? How much does a fake passport cost to buy? How do I check if a passport number is fake? How non-trivial is it to make a fake passport? Traveling on a fake passport is a great way to find out how the prison systems in foreign countries work. I travel with two passports because I'm a citizen of two countries. Both are authentic and legal. Both countries know I have two.
MUN is Model United Nations . It's basically a simulation of the United Nations , and is conducted at the school college and university level. There will be committees such as general assembly , security council , with agendas pertinent to the current global scenario . You will be assigned a country /organisation , of which you will be a delegate of , and you must represent the nation/organisation and follow its foreign policy /motto . Your debating skills , ability to understand international relations ,team work , and diplomatic skills are prone to develop . It's all as per UN standards , from dress code to parliamentary language to rules of procedure . I have attended closely 20 MUNS at the school and college level .
What are you exactly going to record? Are you recording only vocals? Are you going to use instruments as well? If you are using instruments, then what kind of instruments are you going to use? Recording a guitar doesn’t even require a mic while you might need an array of mics if you are going to record a drumkit. If your budget is tight, you can go for Zoom H1 recorder. It’s pretty good for amateur recording and gives very good results for its price. Hope this helps. I want to record me singing. I don't have a microphone. Are there any softwares for Mac that act like a microphone for me to record profession... How can I improve the sound quality of my audio with the use of Condenser Mic and an Audio Mixer. Seriously, it really sounded bad on my lapto... I want to record a song but I can't afford a proper microphone. I decided to use mobile phones. Which phone has the best recording quality? I love almost all genres of music except screamo or metal. Could anyone give me a few suggestions of good songs or bands to listen to? I have a mic, an amplifier, and a laptop, a guitar. How do I record a high quality audio song with help of this? I think you should use a dynamic mic instead of condenser mic. Dynamic mics are used in concerts and live performances, so they do not catch disturbances so easily. Condenser mics are used for studios and are very good at catching slightest of noise. I assume you are not recording in a studio or sound free zone. So based on that assumption. A dynamic mic. You can choose one depending upon your budget. Shure mics are good. Check this. You will get answers What is the best mic I can buy in India for recording YouTube videos? Whether you want to record indoors or outdoors I would suggest you to go with a condenser mic as they are really good in eliminating the natural sounds that surround you and are amazing at catching both vocals and instruments. Following are some of Condenser Mics at budget. Audio Tecnica AT2020 Blue Snowball iCE Blue Yeti You can pair any of the above Mics with a Focusrite Scarlette 2i2 interface and it would just add to the quality of sound you record.
No Tzar has ever had the formal title ‘the Bloody Tzar’ though it was occasionally applied to Tzar Nicholas the second in the aftermath of Bloody Sunday. The hall of Mirrors is in Versailles, France a room created by Louis the XIV to celebrate the fact that he could afford to have room full of mirrors. It’s entirely possibly that you are descended (albeit distantly) from the French or Russian royal families, though it would be via a bastard line from either, as the main lines of both the Bourbons and the Romanovs were exterminated by radical governments, and the major lines are mostly very, very aware who has the ‘right’ to be king.
It's because your body only has one response to stress. The release of adrenaline. When it does this certain things happen to our bodies. Stored glycogen is converted into glucose for quick bursts of energy, blood vessels dilate, heart rate and respiration increases, and blood is shunted away from non essential systems (such as your digestive tract) so that you can more effectively fight or flee. Additionally some people react to a surge of adrenaline by vomiting, there are a couple of possible reasons. First you rid yourself of a couple of pounds of deadweight (remember your digestive tract is shut down) so you move more effectively. Second, while your reaction to adrenaline is almost immediate, it's effects can take many hours to wear off, in that time, with digestion shut down, food could literally spoil in your gut. So you vomit to prevent illness. You just happen to be one of the many who react that way to adrenaline so nausea is your reward. Like I said that is its one stress reaction. It doesn't matter if it is a physical threat, emotional turmoil, or just extreme hunger adrenaline is your body's go to response. Interestingly methamphetamines fill the same receptors as adrenaline, and have the same results. Which include that same nausea. There is a caveat though. You can only be continuously stressed for so long before your body starts to become less sensitive to the effects (of adrenaline or methamphetamines). It likely wont happen witb hunger, but other more constant strain? Almost certainly going to happen. How come I feel so hungry but I really don't want to eat? If I'm not hungry when I wake up in the morning, should I eat breakfast anyway? I am really hungry in the night; with no food and no money. I'm not able to sleep on an empty stomach. How do I manage? Why do I never feel hungry? How can I feel full even when I’m hungry? This happens to me too sometimes. While I can't tell u why it happens, I can tell u how to prevent it. (1) make sure that you eat dinner. Don't under-eat or eat too early. Eat at ur usual time and don't have a snack too late at night (2) drink juice in the morning before you eat anything. This works best if you drink milk, juice, a protein shake, anything other than water after you brish your teeth and ideally about a half hour before you eat breakfast. Hope this helps!
1. How do you set your Service Cost ? Costing Basis :  Most cleaning services charge on hourly basis for their initial visit, but may also charge by the project or by the number of employees they are going to sending to your company on daily or weekly basis according to your requirements. Hire a Flat Fee Charging Company :  You should hire a company that offers one flat fee as in comparison with per-hour charges. With a per-hour charge, you run the risk of the maids moving slower in order to collect a bigger paycheck. Find out if the cleaning service has a "not to exceed this price" clause. 2. How long has the cleaning service been in this profession? Find out how long the company has been around, and how long the employees have been with the business. A brand-new company (or an old company with allnew employees) may not be the best choice because they are less experienced in this profession. It is impertinent that you find out more about the company and the duration for which it has been around and their success and failure ratio. 3. Do you conduct a background check on employees? Does the cleaning service check employee background? Are employees criminal backgrounds checked? Is their residence status confirmed? Most reputable services perform background checks on all of their employees. Any commercial cleaning services company should screen their employees for drug use and verify that they do not have a criminal history. But even better, the best commercial office cleaning company will work hard to look for candidates that are a good fit. This can be done through personality testing. Additionally, verifying previous employment and checking references can go a long way to building a great team. 4. What kind of Quality Control Check do you possess for assuring reliability? Some professional commercial cleaning services companies consider INSPECTIONS as gold standard for quality control in the cleaning industry. Inspections bridge the gap between a facility manager and a cleaning company. Some best Office Cleaning Companies not only make liberal use of inspections, they use technology like apps, software and reporting to communicate the information gathered from inspections quickly and to the right people of cleaning company to adjust your service or handle an issue quickly. 5. Are you insured? Be assure about to check whether the cleaning company is insured or not about any accident or damage. Professional cleaning services will carry liability insurance and bond and have a policy in place in case something gets broken, damaged or goes missing in your office. You should verify coverage in order to give you peace of mind that your Commercial office cleaning company is adequately protected. General Liability Insurance  protects your assets against a variety of claims for alleged negligence or wrongdoing by your Cleaning Company. Workers Compensation Insurance  covers job-related accidents that injure, disable, or kill an employee. Workers Compensation Insurance covers employees at your place of business and during business related travelling. Automobile Liability Insurance  protects people and property from accidents that occur involving your cleaning company’s auto fleet as they come and go from your business. 6. Are you well equipped? A company that believes in a high standard of customer service will work closely with you to ensure that your property is serviced by the right equipment. The company should service and maintain all its equipment at its own costs to guarantee that your property is well serviced. Also, make sure the janitorial services company stocks and supplies cleaning and paper products, bathroom supplies, garbage bags and lighting so that you are never out of supplies. 7.

Q:  Is it illegal to read and drive? A:  Yes, it is illegal to read and drive. It doesn’t matter if it’s a Kindle, or a newspaper, or a novel, or even a map. Too many times I have seen a driver on the road with a newspaper slapped up on the steering wheel, or a driver looking down in their lap. Usually this occurs in bad traffic stop and start conditions, but that doesn’t make it safe in any way. While in many/most locations it is not illegal to have a GPS application running, either on a smart phone or a dedicated GPS receiver, as long as the unit is statically mounted in such a way as to not require the user’s hands, nor to impede in their visibility of the road. Even in Maryland a driver may have a hands-free phone call. However, many researchers feel that is just as distracting as holding a phone in your hand. So this may go away someday. I am a Waze user and often drive down through Maryland, and have not run into any such issues. Maryland state police are very thorough about monitoring traffic. Is it legal to read a book while driving? If you build a car, is it illegal to drive it on U.S. streets? Is it legal to read a newspaper while driving a Tesla with Autopilot on? Is it illegal to splash someone on the sidewalk while driving down the road? Is it illegal to drive with a picture of your license? It is illegal to do anything which distracts you from driving. Therefore yes, it is illegal to read and drive. No, your Kindle is not ok to use. Think about it. How could it possibly be safe for you to read a book on your Kindle and drive at the same time. If you require legal assistance, please contact a lawyer in yo... Repeat after me: The only thing you should be doing while driving is  driving. Legal, illeagal,  you’re not paying attention. That is how people get killed. Yes, it is illegal to read and drive. In California there is what is known as the "basic speed law," which essentially states that it is illegal to operate a vehicle at a speed that is unsafe for the prevailing conditions. If the prevailing condition is that you, the driver, are reading, then it could be reasonably argued that the safe speed is zero mph. My understanding is that most states have a similar statute. Every US state and most international jurisdictions have general laws against distracted driving. In California, I’ve also seen tickets upheld for violating the basic California speed law. This law states that it is illegal to be driving faster than conditions permit. Several courts have ruled that the maximum safe speed for driving while reading is 0 mph. Reading inherently requires you to focus on the text and follow along with it. Switching focus between the text and other activities impairs both reading comprehension and outside perception. Failing to perceive your environment while driving is very dangerous. What’s more, reading adds a cognitive burden. Your brain is processing the words and ideas and is less able to react to outside events. This increases the danger. finally, holding the kindle and pressing or swiping to change pages means that one or both hands are not controlling the wheel. This augments the danger yet again. I strongly suggest switching to audiobooks or saving your reading until the car is safely parked.
Our freedom of choice… we take it highly for granted and use it for destruction, overpopulation, war, dictation of other species, mutilation of the planet. The list goes on. Our freedom of choice makes us a cancer to this earth.
USING ORGANIC AND PAID SEARCH TOGETHER Because the mentality of online searchers tends to be different for paid and organic traffic, marketers can use this to their advantage when integrating the two for SEO campaigns. Seasonal campaigns or campaigns that need to get quick attention and traffic can both benefit from utilizing  PPC  as well as organic. Because PPC ads go straight to the first page of Google and catch attention quickly, they tend to be effective for time sensitive information. For e-commerce websites advertising products, paid search can benefit  SEO  because ads typically have high conversion rates PPC data can give a clear idea of exactly what kind of  ROI and conversion  value a keyword will have. SEO data can describe traffic for a given keyword. Together, the two data resources allow you to pick keywords that actually  bring in revenue - not just traffic.

First of all, if your nephew has parents you need to notify them of his behavior and let them discipline him. If they are aware and aren't doing anything or if they are and he still continues, the problem may be that your nephew lacks empathy. Children injure animals for a number of reasons. Most often it is that they have witnessed or are a product of abuse themselves. Is that a potential aspect in your nephews life that could be contributing to his behavior? If so then I suggest that you should deal with the root of the problem in order to have him leave the animals alone. Can I turn my dog into a pelt? Can I feed Parle G biscuits to stray dogs? How do I take care of a street dog puppy? Which biscuit is good for a street dog? My mom is scared of street dogs. How do I convince her to buy/adopt one for me? I would get myself a bucket of pebbles and ask your nephew to go stand across the street….then ready a handful of pebbles and tell him you’re ready to throw them like he does at the dogs. This sort of thing angers me and this is my first reaction. The correct reaction is to learn by introduction to said street dogs  where he could make a friend.  Encourage him to bring some water out to the dogs, and if you can afford it, some food.  Water will at least bring them near and if he sits quietly they will investigate and in time he can learn to pet and enjoy them. They will enjoy each other. Emphasize the importance of kindness.  He might become the new Pied Piper or at least develop an empathy for those less fortunate. If you would, please let me know how you two fare….I have hopes for a positive outcome and understanding of humanity and kindness.
1. Obviously, Pakistan won't yield to International Court verdict in favour of Kulbhushan Jadhav, today. Their army will now blame Nawaz Sharif for not defending the case properly; and hence I expect the differences between the two to widen. Perhaps good for India. 2. Most likely their army won't have the audacity to 'kill' Mr Jadhav, as Indian Govt has warned they will go to any extent to save him. So, killing now, after the court verdict, will be suicidal for them; as it will give legitimacy to any retaliatory major strike by India. 3. India should now take the matter to UNSC, as that alone has the power to get the ICJ verdict implemented. 4. India is not a member of UNSC. While other 4 members may support India, China will be forced to use its Veto power to save its 'friend' whom it wants to colonise ultimately.... God knows when. But the problem is by doing so China will get exposed globally and face embarrassment, which it may not like for no immediate gains. Hence, China may compel Pakistani to kill Jadhav, showing it a 'death' due to sickness, etc, the moment it learns India is approaching the Security Council. 5. So, Pakistan in a catch-22 situation, a big bone in its threat which it can neither swallow nor throw up. They should have thought 100 times before taking 'punga' with India. Don't know how long will they take to understand that India since 2014 is no more a Soft State it used to be. Unprecedented bold decision of India to take the issue to ICJ has proved counterproductive for them. Any debates about Jadhav will only draw international attention to internal problems in Balochistan; which India will surely exploit. 6. Well, Pakistani army may be haughty, and stupid, not finding a way how to deal with the new India; but why our opposition is acting foolish? When will they realise that their antics of taking pro-Paki line is also going to boomerang? I'm saying so bcs today Manish Tiwari, Congress spokesman, was taking pro-Pakistani line over NDTV. What is your view on Mr. Kulbhushan Jadhav's case at International court of justice? Who's lying and who's legit? What is your view/opinion about International Court of Justice (ICJ) hearing on Kulbhushan Jadhav's case? What is your view on ICJ's verdict on former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav? Is it a major setback for Pakistan in the global arena? Why did Pakistan feel angry when India went to the ICJ regarding Kulbhushan Jadhav when they themselves go to the UN every now and then for Ka... What could India do apart from going to ICJ to stop Pakistan from executing Kulbhushan Jadhav secretly? ICJ had not given any verdict in the case. They have only stayed the hanging till final verdict. I am not sure if Pakistan will adhere to it if verdict goes on favour of India. They may kill him in some other way like poisoning etc. They may simply refuse to accept verdict. I can see only 1% chance of his return to India & that also when i am being highly optimistic Keep your fingers cross. Who knows, India may get hold of some more of their senior guys& get some exchange done If India is able to save him, it will be a historical victory for India. He was a senior guy & his safety means alot to India The ICJ’s 11 judge bench has ordered Pakistan not to execute innocent Indian citizen Kulbhudhan Jadhav till the court gives its final decision. The court also directed Pakistan to take all measures at its disposal to ensure that Mr Jadhav is safe till final virdict. The court struck down Pakistan’s contention that the ICJ had no jurisdiction to hear the Indian petition. Hours later Pakistan informed Court the execution was not imminent till August.
Yes, if they contain CO2 and SO2 then they combine with water vapor to form corrosive carbonic acid and sulfuric acid. The latter is a much stronger acid being responsbile for acid rain when it comes from coal burning. The gasses should be scrubbed by sulfur scavenging units before being flared. How many liters of petrol are produced from one barrel of crude oil? Crude Oil: Why is WTI oil cheaper than Brent oil? What are some of the products made from crude oil? Why is the flare burning in a refinery? Why is oil priced/traded in U.S. dollars? Some of the process streams that are routed to the flare system are corrosive. This is typically because of contaminants rather than the hydrocarbons in the system. Both hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide are commonly found in flare gas, and both of them can cause corrosion in steel piping. Probably the worst contaminant that can sometimes be found in the flare is HF. For refineries that use HF acid in their Alkylation process, an upset on that unit can put acid in the flare system. (There is a relief gas scrubber that is intended to neutralize the acid with potassium hydroxide before it leaves the unit, but it can stop working properly if the gas rates are too high or if the neutralizing solution gets spent and not replenished quickly enough.)

It’s suggested that most wizards don’t really care about house-elves; they use them as tools and don’t bother studying and delving into their powers. Harry and Hermione are exceptions: they were raised by Muggles, therefore they’re free of any preexisting bias and prejudice, and Harry specifically is known to be very kind towards all those who are marginalized and wronged. It’s likely that a lot of wizards (perhaps including Voldemort) don’t know the full extent of the house-elves’ power or don’t even think about them. Moreover, Voldemort is deeply racist. He views half-human and non-human creatures as inferior to wizards, Muggleborn wizards as inferior to those who have magical ancestry, half-bloods as inferior to pure-bloods, and everybody as inferior to himself. He would never use a house-elf as a means of transportation or a companion; Kreacher he used as a guinea pig, he didn’t count on him for something dangerous and risky that needed trust. Last but not least, Voldemort  didn’t want  to enter Hogwarts; not only was he afraid of Dumbledore and wouldn’t risk a fight with him, but there was nothing there for him. Only towards the last chapters of  The Deathly Hallows  did he need to invade the castle, and there was no house-elf around at the time. It would absurd to call off the attack and try to find an elf, especially when there were defenders everywhere in the castle; Voldemort needed to defeat them, not simply sneak inside. Which Hogwarts House would you be in, and why? Why didn't Slytherin house take part in the Battle of Hogwarts? Which Hogwarts house was Mad Eye Moody in? At Hogwarts, is it possible to switch houses? What house was Cornelius Fudge in at Hogwarts? Voldemort didn’t understand house-elf magic; therefore, it never would have crossed his mind that such a thing as taking mastery of and then ordering a house-elf to take him into Hogwarts was possible. He didn’t use Kreacher’s magic to Apparate to the cave, and he certainly didn’t know or suspect that Kreacher would Apparate off the island. When Dobby first meets Harry Potter, he informs him that under Voldemort’s time, house-elves were treated “like vermin.” Given how poorly we see the Malfoy’s treatment of Dobby, we can only wonder how much worse did it get. We saw in the books how Dobby circumvented the Malfoys, and how Kreacher betrayed Sirius. Doubtless any house-elf hapless enough to have been forced to serve Voldemort would have found some way to muck up the trip, perhaps by Apparating He-Who-Was-Nasty-To-House-elves into a wall, or better yet, directly into the u-bend of Moaning Myrtle’s toilet. He never knew elves could apparate despite the protection spells. Otherwise he wouldnt take Kreacher to his childhood picnic spot where he did the Slytherin locket (horcrux) to check out the effects of his crazy potion on Kreacher (that Dumbledore drank). He wouldn't have left Kreacher to die there along with the horcrux secret as he planned. And then, RAB would never know through Kreacher about the horcrux. What Voldemort didn’t respect and value, he didn’t take the trouble to understand. He therefore never realised that house-elves could bypass some wizardly restrictions. That’s why Regulus Black was able to find out about the locket Horcrux, because Voldemort never realised Kreacher could get out of the Horcrux lake by himself. That was one of the mistakes that contributed to his downfall, you know. Voldemort was the most arrogant wizard that ever wizarded. The idea of asking a “lower life form” which is what he though house elves (along with muggles and anyone that wasn’t a pureblood wizard) for help would never have crossed his mind. I’m pretty sure he could have. But I don’t think he thought of ever using house elves for anything other than cleaning up and making meals.
Affiliate marketing is one of the most popular ways of making money online. It is about a relationship between three main parties: the affiliate (publisher), the merchant (advertiser), and the customer. Affiliates act as extended sales and marketing departments of the merchants and help the customers choose products. Affiliate marketing can provide you with a steady flow of income. What you can earn depends on how successful you are in converting your audience into buyers and service subscribers. It is cost effective and you can work from any place in the world. Sounds easy, doesn’t it? Although affiliate marketing doesn’t require a fortune and years of experience to get started, you shouldn’t expect great results overnight. It is very competitive and you need to spend some time choosing products, making sure that they meet market needs, learn how to promote them and how to measure the success. What is affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing. When you sign up for a partner program, you are assigned a link with a unique ID that makes it possible to track all traffic you send to the advertiser’s site. If your visitor clicks on it and performs the qualified action, you will receive a commission. The qualified action depends on the compensation model. The most commonly used one is pay per sale model which is based on the revenue sharing when a merchant pays an affiliate the percentage of the sale. How to become an affiliate marketer Even though becoming an affiliate marketer can seem like a lot of work, you can make your life a bit easier by organizing your work a bit. By following these steps, you will be able get your own affiliate marketing off the ground in no time. In my Free Training “30 Days to Affiliate Business Success” I go into way more detail about how I started earning a living from affiliate marketing with my strategy. If you are interested in making a living from your own online business I highly recommend checking it out. 1. Find your niche In order to succeed you need to start with three basic steps: Find your proper audience, analyze the problem your audience is facing, solve their problems and help them achieve their goals. If you are not sure what products and solutions your audience would benefit from, you should do proper research. Start with forums and websites popular in your specific industry. What are the most common questions and the most popular products? 2. Become an Expert in your niche When you write products reviews you should know more about them, than your average site visitors. Make sure you provide an honest description and accurate information. If a merchant offers a free trial, make sure to sign up and test it. You can start with the products you use and know well and share your own experience. If you decide to build a website from scratch with the purpose of affiliate marketing and the topic is completely new to you, you will have to spend a lot of time doing proper research. It can bring great results, but before you dive in, first make sure you are enthusiastic about the chosen topic. 3. Find affiliate programs to promote Once you have a category of products selected, you need to choose affiliate programs. You can either sign up for affiliate networks or choose independent programs run by the merchants. Don’t choose advertisers based solely on the highest commission. There are a couple of important factors: Does the merchant have a  good reputation  and sell quality products? You wouldn’t like to promote a brand that generates bad word of mouth. Don’t forget that you are putting your reputation on the line too when promoting a product to your customers. Would you buy it yourself or recommend it to your family? If you don’t trust the company, don’t promote it. If you don’t know the product well, check review websites and read testimonials from other users. Does the merchant look  reliable ? You don’t want to promote the business that probably won’t be on the market in a couple of months. Think about the  payout . Do you prefer high one-time commission or do you prefer making money on each payment your customers make? When you promote SaaS products, a  lifetime recurring commission may seem to be much more attractive in a long term. Do similar brands offer similar percentage? As mentioned before, don’t fall for a very high commission and get–rich–quick promise. What’s the  performance model  that works best for you? If there is not a lot of traffic on your website, don’t expect to make a fortune in a pay per click model. However, if you have even a small group of loyal readers, there is a chance that they will buy a product you recommend (pay-per-sale should be your choice then). Is this program  free to join  and do you have to be a customer? How the  lifetime cookie  works? Will your visitors be assigned to your affiliate account if they return to the merchant site after several months? Check the  terms and conditions  for clauses in the agreement that you find unacceptable eg. whether trademark bidding on search engines is allowed. How about  reports ? Will you be able to easily track your results? 4. Start promoting There are many traffic sources and you can try them out simultaneously to increase your chances of making money: Banners: linking images and banners to the merchant’s website is the least you can do to get started. Focus on quality, not quantity. One well-placed banner is worth a thousand spread across the whole website. Social Media: testimonials on Twitter and Facebook can bring great results, but you can also try other channels. Pinterest disappointed many users by removing the affiliate links in Feb 2015 to bring them back over a year later. Now you can share photos of your recommended products (relevant to your boards!) and include affiliate links. Newsletters: collect emails from your website visitors and let them know when you publish a new post. Reviews: share your personal opinion about a product. Why do you find it useful? How did it improve your KPIs? Visitors read reviews to learn something new and find out what experience other people had with a product or service. Comparison posts– who’s offering the best deal? What’s the difference between product A and product B? Tutorials: step–by–step instructions and tips on how to make the most of the product. Resource page: recommend solutions that you use on your website. Ebook: if you consider yourself a writer and have interesting statistics or stories you’d like to share, publish an ebook. You can include your affiliate links in text or images. Anything else you can think of: be creative and come up with new ideas. A comparison post doesn’t have to include a table. For example, you can come up with a quiz for your audience and show the products that match their answers. Remember: Products you promote and the content you create should match. Your audience comes to your website or signs up to your newsletters to read valuable articles. Focus on your readers, the problems they may face, and how to solve them. If your content is of real value and doesn’t look like it’s been created for the sole purpose of promotion, people will more likely click on links. 5. Monitor your results In affiliate marketing it is important to test various promotional strategies and track your online marketing efforts. If the merchant provides reports based on UTM codes, don’t forget to tag your campaigns. It will help you understand what kind of campaigns work with your audience. Affiliate marketing done right Affiliate marketing is not as easy as it seems, but when it’s done right, it’s worth the effort. Foster relationships, learn every day to become an expert in your niche, and focus on creative ways to promote affiliate programs.

As a professional, I have my own portfolio. I’d show it to a potential client. If he/she insists that I perform a non-paid excercise to test my abilities, I would politely decline and show myself out. I am not at school anymore, why would a client be prepared to decide upon the quality of my work? I have respect for myself and for my professional career. Would you go into a restaurant and demand the chef to prepare something for you just to see if you like the food? I do not have any problem working pro bono, but I do not work for free. What is it like to work as a graphic designer? Why are graphic designers always asked to work for free? What is the work of a graphic designer? How can I get admission in graphic design at IITB? What exams must be cleared? How many years of experience would I need in order to do freelance work in graphic design? Badly. Very badly. In the moment, I’ve probably been very gracious and completed whatever task has been set before me — perhaps somewhat facetiously. But in theory, I hate it. The idea that a CV including years of design work, clients like National Geographic and Harper Collins, and a first class degree in graphic design can be met with a “we need you to do this task so we can make sure you’re really a designer” is deeply frustrating. The way job applications work now is pretty messed up (for instance, having a degree in something is worth more than lengthy experience) but to force interviewees to take on exercises to prove they’re not massive liars is pretty irksome. But then, you do have to consider that these companies have probably been burned before by bad hires - though that still isn’t our fault as designers. A professional should never be asked to work for free. While it’s true that advertising agencies sometimes do this in order to get a large advertising account, they choose to assume the risk because the potential reward is a contract that may be worth millions of dollars. Designers are rarely in that situation. If a potential client asks you to any kind of work (even rough concepts) with no guarantee of payment, they do not have your interests at heart and do not consider what you do to be of much value. This is not the kind of client you want to work for. If you do this even once, it sets a precedent, and I guarantee you will be asked to do it again once they know you’re willing. I personally know of situations in which a designer gave away his ideas in hopes of landing the business only to find that the “client” took his ideas and had another designer do the work. This practice is unethical and devalues then entire design industry. What IS acceptable is doing preliminary design work for a fee, but giving the client the option of terminating the project if he decides not to follow it through to completion. However, it should be made clear in writing that ownership of the concepts remain yours and the client relinquishes the right to use your ideas after that point. Not well. It’s all in context, of course. Junior-level, just out of school, not much resume? It’s not necessarily unreasonable. I’ve got 30+ years in the arena. A “test’ of my competence is both an insult and an admission of ignorance on their part. Why in the world would I want to work with an organization like that? Are YOU Experienced?
The question as stated is too general. Many many people are spiritual, or consider themselves spiritual. Whether they have an ego would require a massive study, but most likely it would find they do exhibit symptoms of ego, just like everyone else. However I will answer from a different perspective:  Is the object of living a spiritual life to circumvent the ego? To this I would say very much  YES . You see the ego is the sum of the animal “material mind” that we got as a part of evolution. Its vitally necessary, you cant live without it. But as you grow spiritually what you are doing is growing your soul, which is what you gained from God, and what distinguishes us from all animals. And, after a huge amount of spiritual growth, it is possible to operate out of soul, and ensure the material mind, aka ego, is no longer in control. I have experienced this state for 24 hours, so I do know what I am talking about. You do literally lose your mind. I live in hope I can achieve this state permanently, If you are interested in hat it is like to ny have an ego,  I described my experience here. How is the ego useful in the spiritual journey? Why do people go spiritual? What does spirituality/philosophy say about ego? How do I overcome my ego to be able to learn from other people? What is an ego? Is having an ego a bad thing, psychologically speaking? We on the earth plane all have an ego, a desire to feel separate an unique, and yet a spiritual individual surrenders this concept and reminds themselves that their identity will pass and the greater and eternal part knows only it is an extension of creation and of the Creator. We meditate and live being reminded of this truth, rather than feel we depend on others to either help us or to be exploited etc etc. Spiritual people are mindful of their flaws and boundaries, and for that matter others. Yes, they have an ego. Ideally they have understood that their ego is their barrier and “work” on that. But in reality many spiritual people have a very big egos (“I am so spiritual”, “I am more intelligent than others”, “I am such a good person and take care about others”, “I am right and I know better. My spirituality is the only way” …) Of course spiritual people have an ego. An ego is very useful in daily life. Without one, you would not even answer to the call of your name. Recognizing the ego for what it is…that is the trick.
A U.S. tax return won’t specifically indicate information such as net worth. It will indicate sources of taxable income, and indicate expenditures that are allowable as deductions or credits under US Tax law. These figures can be used to INFER information such as: - Holdings in Corporations, Small Corporations (S-Corps), LLC’s, and Partnerships. - Other sources of business income that may be conducted - Sources of investment income (Banks in which he deposits money or makes loans) - Sources of interest income (loans to related entities, or unrelated entities - as the case may be) - How much in charity he spends personally - may not indicate how charitable his businesses are depending on their own tax structure. - How much he spends in mortgage or investment interest - How much he spends on real estate taxes There’s plenty of information in there, DEPENDING on how he has arranged all his various business interests. If they are separate legal entities, then those entities might be filing completely separate tax filings, in which case you may possibly need to examine the tax returns of possibly over 100 entities (a search of the New York Secretary of State database revealed over 100 entities that had the name Trump in their registered business name - this could indicate Donald, his family, or other non-related Trumps) ( Search Results ) You won’t be able to see things such as balances of debt - you might be able to estimate based on interest expense - IF you can correctly estimate what interest rate he might pay. To summarize - Individual Income tax returns only show certain, specific items as they are necessary and required to prepare an accurate income tax return. They do NOT typically portray net worth, total assets, total liabilities, or the source of them. You may be able to estimate, guess, or infer certain information, and use the return to then determine where else you might look to put together a picture, but it won’t do it by itself. As far as obtaining the return - I speculate the only way that his returns can be obtained by the Public in some manner are by coercion or convincing Trump it’s in his best interest. The only way a prosecutor or some other investigating committee could obtain it is through congressional or other subpoena or warrant, and even then, they might NOT be allowed to release it publicly- AND they’d have to have some suspicion of fraud or other illegal activity (some sort of reasonable cause) to ask for it in the first place. Trump certainly has enough lawyers at his disposal to fight such a subpoena for some time. Otherwise, it would be considered an invasion of private information. Until Congress or the several states pass laws to require the release of certain information such as summaries of tax returns to get on the presidential ballot, I’m not sure we have much recourse other than to continue to demand it publicly, and act accordingly.
Religion is  deen  in  Arabic , which comes from the  Sumerian  (4000 BC) word din, bright light, which is  ten  in  Turkish  and  tin  in  Mongolian.  Dingir  is God in Sumerian, the light creator, also  Tengri  in Turkish and  Tingir  in Mongolian.  Din  derivatives, after semantic shifts are all on religion:  Old Persian  (1000 BC) word  dena , legal and social way of life,  Akkadian /Babylonian/Assyrian (2000 BC) word  deen , social order,  Hebrew  (1000 BC) word  din , law, even possibly but not definitely the  Sanskrit  (1000 BC)  dharma , way of life. Therefore religion in European languages has emphasis on underlying  beliefs  and rituals, whereas religion has more  social  emphasis in where it started. In Arabic there are the words  millet  or  medhab  for belief sets. For a religion to exist you need a community above all - beliefs come second. In fact there are religions without explicit beliefs.  American Way of Life  (also referred as  Freedom  for short) is a religion without a precise belief set but nevertheless glues 300m people together even in extreme cases like World Wars with rules mutually agreed upon.  Leninism  was a religion with better defined divine (called scientific) text. To create a new religion you need to create a self-sustainable community. If it is too small yet with strong cohesion, it is a  cult . Let us look from the size point of view: Order of 1 — Usually people conducting extremely unconventional life-styles, such as long-term serial killers, have  one-man religions , with well-defined but unconventional sets of relations between concepts and actions. Sometimes a lifestyle for an atomic family may be described an isolate religion, satirised in the movie Captain Fantastic. Order of 10 — There are  clan-sized religions , again usually involving unconventional or illegal life-styles, very hard to sustain therefore needing an extremely dominant family leader to decree the rules. Order of 100 —  Cults  also demand very strong community leadership to make up for the pressures of the outside larger community. Highest priority of a cult is on membership loyalty and coherence. Order of 1000 —  Large cults or small religions , are usually self-sufficient due to several alternative members for professional needs. If they are geographically distributed, higher professions are usually within membership. If geographically compact, lower professional competencies would do. Order of 10000 — There is no further pressure on the community to declare itself a separate religion because of its established self-sufficiency, unforced intermarriage, intra-community jobs, entertainment and news, and can define itself as an  independent church , denomination, order or other terminology that accepts the umbrella of a broader religion. Yet it also sees itself separate. If the foundations are completely different from an existing belief set or not based on an established divine text, a critical decision may be made to call itself a separate religion. Therefore it primarily depends on the number of members and their cohesion rather than the beliefs alone. What elements are required to create a new religion? Can anyone create a new religion? Why or why not? How do I create a religion? Is there a need for a new religion? I want to create a new religion. Where do I start? There are thousands of religions, and each one has its own followers believe that they follow the true one. Why not just create their own reli... People these days hate religion. They think religion is evil. They are at one level, there are some people who are beyond that level, they hate government as well. Government today is more powerful than religion in any country. They use religion as a pawn to come up. The Godmen use theism as a pawn to raise up. Anyway, because of all these powers either pulling you down or pulling you sideways, it is very difficult to create a new religion. Many Godmen have come up in India in last 70 years of independence, none of them are successful in creating a new religion, not even a new caste. Basavanna in karnataka founded Lingayat caste, Guru Nanak found Sikh religion. After that all others are creating a following, a group that is not really a caste or a religion. Aryasamaj, Brahmasamaj, Akbar’s new religion, all wilted. Modern gurus are just reinforcing people’s religious thoughts, catering to what people think they need. They are becoming succesful, they are getting what they are not creating a new religion. Creating a religion depends on where you live. In India, it is very very tough. Hinduism is a non-religion. If you call religion 1, non religion is 0. As Shankaracharya said, shoonyat shoonyamaadaaya shoonyameva parishishyate, you take out nothing from nothing, add nothing to nothing, let nothing be undisturbed, it remains nothing. It is like a black hole. However, you can consider current Indian constitution which is so confusing as a religion, that's what defines us now. But I am like you, I want a new religion. I think religion is better than government. I want religion to take over government and religion should be flexible and productive.

I believe he meant that what many people consider as genius is actually the result of hard work over a long time. I think this quote by footballing genius (yes you can be a genius outside of academic spheres) Lionel Messi sums it up best. A genius, just like ‘overnight success’, is the result of a lifetime if hard work perfecting through practise which is where the patience to stick with it comes in. A six-year-old kid (a friend's son) drew this while eating dinner. Is he an artistic genius? How do you know if you’re a genius or just average (without relying on tests)? What did Jean Paul Sartre mean when he said "Hell is other people"? What is the meaning of a genius donkey? What is Putin's IQ? Is he a genius? Was Stalin and Peter the Great a genius? Never give up on creativity even when you are told by others to give it up. Or when you start a job and get restless and feel the finish is never near have confidence and fight on. The difference between Genius and mundane is that Genius is constantly driven and fighting and moving like a train that cannot be stopped. Some are driven mad by this constant desire. The Patience is the spiritual standing back like an architect standing back to look at the whole cathedral rather than the one stone.
Thanks for asking. As a consumer I use SaaS solutions like mail (gmail, outlook etc), software to file my taxes, software to manage my simple book-keeping etc. In my corporate EA role, I have led the evaluation, selection and integration of Financial, Legal, HR and other SaaS solutions. Developing a SaaS solution is almost as easy (or hard) as developing any other software solution with a few major differences Design for scale and customizing Design to enable users accessing from anywhere Support model (IMO, this is the hardest aspect of a SaaS solution since paying customers will expect and demand strong SLAs) What does all this mean? You need to identify a niche where you have an expertise - either a consumer niche (like emails, calendar, scheduling etc) or a corporate niche (HR management) and design a solution to meet those requirements.
Yes,  but first you should know the protein target you are aiming for. I recommend this calculator  FindYourMacros . It will help to determine the exact amount of protein you should be consuming each day. If you are not hitting your targets with your current diet, then you  can consider taking whey protein . If you’re a skinny guy doing a lot of cardio (running and basketball), you can’t expect that taking more protein will help you build the physique of a bodybuilder. The principle of exercise is training and recovery. You stress your body and then your body adapts and grows stronger. If you are mainly doing running and basketball, then your body will likely adapt towards the two images shown below: Runner Basketball player As you can see, for these sports being lean is more important than having bulk muscle (which would only slow you down). For the bodybuilder, he doesn’t care that the two above are faster and better at basketball, he just wants big muscles: DISCLAIMER: I’m the co-founder of  WheyCartel WheyCartel  supplies the  worlds highest quality Whey Protein Isolate , with 96.9g of protein per 100g. Should I start taking whey protein for muscle gain? How many days would 5 pound whey protein last? And how much whey protein should I take daily? Can a skinny guy build body in one year? Do Whey protein and other mass gainers contain steroids? My doctor once mentioned that these products do contain a certain amount of steroids ... I play badminton for 2 hours & run for 40 minutes. Is taking whey protein recommended for me to maintain weight? Or is it only for those who h... Surely you can take whey protein to meet your protein goal. Obviously you have to maximize your protein intake by regular proteic food as chicken,eggs or egg white to cut down some fats. I assume you are pretty young so activity like basketball will give you some results as your body reacts well when stimulated in a younger age. If you want to put on some muscle you should consider to lift some weights or just do bodyweight exercise (for example push up,pull up and squats and variations of these exsercise). As you grow up you will know your body better and adapt your workouts to your needs. Please do not think that taking whey protein will give some muscle! You will have to workout properly, stimulate the body to grow and meet protein goal by eating proteic food. Protein powder is just needed if can't take enough protein from your meals. Hope it helps!
First of all, you can't complain to TRAI. There's consumer forums for this purpose. Secondly, I suppose you have a jio SIM and have stopped recharging, which is a sufficient reason for airtel to block your services(only incoming calls are not a source of income, ironically, if you get it). If it has been six months since your last recharge and your account had low balance, maybe that's why your sim was blocked Contact CC n tell them you will recharge so old turn it sim back on. My Airtel 3G signal is lost on all the devices I try. It stopped abruptly. What should I do? Why did my Airtel Prepaid SIM get blocked? How do I stop the Airtel live pop ups in my Android mobile? Please help! How do I reactivate my Airtel prepaid number? How do I complain about Airtel services? Thats what happens when you buy sim without documents. Karma bro.
What are some legitimate reasons a cash buyer could delay a closing on a house? Among the possibilities: The cash buyer doesn’t have the cash him/herself.  The buyer was planning to borrow the money from a hard money lender and, for any number of reasons, the money hasn’t come through yet. The “cash buyer” really is wholesaling the property.  That is, he’s putting it under contract, then assigning the contract. However, it’s possible the wholesaler hasn’t found anyone who wants the property. There’s a problem with the home inspection.   Even cash buyers should have a home inspection contingency. There’s a problem with the title.  It may be clouded in some fashion, and needs to be cleaned up before the sale can occur. The seller agreed to deliver the property vacant, but there’s still a tenant in there.  (Usually, the tenant is entitled to remain in a property for the full term of his/her lease, even if the property is sold . . . unless the lease specifically addresses the sale of the property. In those cases, the seller often tries negotiating with the tenant—“cash for keys. But the tenant may say no, or may ask for more money in order to terminate the lease early.) If  the seller is obligated to perform certain actions (such as providing condo documents or HOA documents to the buyer) and hasn’t done so yet,  the purchase agreement actually might become void. At the very least, this could delay closing until the required documents are provided. If there's an "on or around about" closing date, can a cash buyer delay a closing because he's having trouble getting all of the cash together... When there's an "on or around date" set for a house closing, can the buyer delay it by 60-90 days due to financial problems? Do house buyers keep the home staging items? What are some good tips for first time house buyers? I live in Orlando. For some reason, I have to buy my father's house. Is there any home buyer in Orlando? Usually it's financing related when underwriting comes back with certain conditions that must first be satisfied before closing the loan. When issues arise during the transaction, both agents work together with their client to extend and resolve items should more time be needed than the original contract outlined. You might've heard the term, “time is of the essence.” Well in a real estate transaction, these different dates and deadlines are critical to ensuring a smooth transaction and ultimately what gets everyone to the closing table. If a date passes without a resolution, the party loses that right and the transaction either moves forward onto the next contingency or in some cases, if both sides cannot mutually agree on something by the specified date for example, the contract becomes void and is no longer a valid, legally enforceable agreement. Most of the time both parties act in good faith since it is in everyone's best interest to keep the deal together and is generally preferred to amend/extend rather than terminating and restarting the process from scratch which can be both costly and time consuming when you consider now that EVERYONE is basically restarting the whole process over from beginning; putting the home back on the market, finding a qualified buyer whose loan will close, the Buyer now needing to find another home, and essentially going through everything else over again. In some instances if the Buyer used FHA financing and is forced to terminate the contract there are additional negative implications to the Seller now (in Colorado at least) because going forward, should the Seller put the home back on the market, FHA guidelines require that that FHA appraisal valuation remains with the home for 6 months, which in turns lowers the Sellers negotiating power and leverage since they can't justify a higher asking price because the appraisal valuation remains and is disclosed to future potential Buyers. The loan objection deadline is usually the last recourse for your buyer before the closing date to terminate should some financing related issue come up and it is their last chance of having their earnest money returned. There are a number of other reasons for amending the original purchase agreement to extend dates or make changes (inspection and appraisal are among the biggest negotiating points and parts of the transaction between the parties should there be an appraisal discrepancy, or if the Buyer & Seller can't agree on repairs after inspection, for example. The “on or before” term is generally used when both parties first agree to the extension, and then should whatever issue there was be resolved sooner than both parties originally may have anticipated, the Buyer & Seller can agree to close on an earlier date. The term “legitimate” itself would need more analysis. In Colorado where I work, closing dates are firm and contractual unless both parties agree to an extension. There are times when practicality supersedes the letter of the contract and the parties will agree to an extension even if they don’t want to. For example, in recent years we have had significant issues with appraisal delays due to appraiser shortages. We have had to extend many contracts to provide more time for appraisals to be completed. Nobody likes it, but if the seller wants to sell and the buyer wants to buy, we extend the contract to keep the transaction together. Same for loan processing/approval delays, funding delays, and other delays beyond the control of either party. Many delays and issues are actually within the control of one or both parties, with a little anticipation and pro-active approach. So we have to be careful when asking for extensions because if the other party perceives that the problem could have been prevented with proper planning, they may or may not agree to extend and many buyers have lost their property of choice because a seller refused to extend the appraisal, loan, closing, or other dates in the contract. Most times because there’s a mortgage delay of some kind, a credit issue needing fixing, a co-signer problem, a title search matter, an old property lien found, a hesitancy/problem on the buyers buyer of their home which has to be closed prior to your closing, etc. Mostly though, the ‘on or around date’ is really just a legal way to extend time IF needing it without an automatic cancel of agreement. A way to keep both buyer and seller locked into an agreement where otherwise it would have expired. A very dangerous clause as terms move from specifics to reasonable (of which everyone has a different opinion of what ‘around’ is).
So I’m guessing the V is an absolute value function. But more over, I would examine the two lines of the V separately. Observe that on the right side of the V, you get the function y= 2x-2, just from (0,-2), and (1,0). You can find the slope, and you know the y intercept. Now in order to find the intersection of 2x-2 with kx^2, set the two equations equal to one another kx^2= 2x-2 kx^2–2x+2=0; use the quadratic formula, and notice that 4–4(k)(2) = 0 [under the square root part of the quadratic formula], then you know k= 0.5, So I think the answer is y= 0.5x^2 Can you help me solve this JEE Parabola question? How do you solve this math problem and what area of mathematics will help me prepare for similar problems? What is the difference between how math majors solve math problems and how science majors solve math problems? Can someone help me solve this tricky trig problem involving bearings? Can somebody help me with this math problem?  Slope of line on right is 2. Both the parabola and the line on the right intersect at point (a,b). Two equations can be written: b = 2a-2 (from y=2x-2) b=ka^2 (from y=kx^2) or ka^2 =2a-2 using the equation for the parabola y=kx^2 we get dy/dx=2kx. By definition this is the slope of the line tangent to the parabola at point x. Since the tangent line to the parabola at point (a,b) has a slope of 2 we write 2=2ka, hence k=1/a Substituting into ka^2 =2a-2 we get (1/a)a^2 = 2a-2. Solving for a we get a=2 Using k=1/a we get k=1/2 Using b=ka^2 we get b=2 So: The equation of the parabola is y=0.5x^2 The lines intersect the parabola at (2,2) on the right and (-2,2) on the left (since they’re symmetric).

How can I hack a WiFi with rooted phone? Can my parents see my phone's WiFi history through the router? Is there any way to hack a WiFi network and know its password? Can you hack a phone if you have their wifi saved? First isolate the phone from network resources both mobile and wifi. Then check for malware and spyware on the device. If in doubt use your carrier to help you wipe the phone. There is Anti-virus and anti-malware software for Android and Windows phones; I like Bit Defender. When you are on someone else’s WiFI they are within their rights to look at everything you do while on the network. Get a VPN service to encrypt the data as it leaves your phone; I like Private Internet Access or PIA. PIA can be paid any number of ways, including walmart gift cards. PIA also doesnt keep traffic records for more tha nfifteen minutes and they dont keep names either. No payment info is kept. In short PIA cant tell on you becuase they dont know It all depends on how their network is setup and if they felt the need to do so. Chances are they will never have the need to do this and even if they thought you were being unsafe or putting others at risk they would likely inform the appropriate authorities instead. But given the 1/1000000 chances they decide to “hack “ your phone it depends on how their network is setup to cache data and what kind of device you have. If you have an iPhone and you always use secure https versions of sites and or a VPN your pretty safe because the list of people who can beat the 2FA for iCloud and such is a very short list. However if you have an android device it's a whole new kettle of fish. This is because there are numerous publicly Available resources that go into great detail about exploits for the android OS in which case they can use these to “bug” your phone and snoop around.

A2A. SAP expertise is in high demand, and SAP consultants make gobs of money. So, from that point of view, in the short and medium term, this is probably a great opportunity. On the other hand — nobody knows how long SAP will remain on top, and there is the issue of your interest for the field: you seem to be fairly uninterested. I guess it depends on where you live, how good your degree is, and whether you feel that you will get other good opportunities. If you are not sure about the latter, take the job right away. There are ways to manage a career that would allow you to take the job, make sure that you have non-SAP minor assignments, and find another job in a couple of years. The minor assignments becomes critical for that purpose.

An easy way to do so is to represent all possibilities by making a tree. There is 2^3=8 possibilities ( {‘T=tail’,’T=head’} ^3) 3 tails : T T T 2 tails : T T H or T H T or H T T 1 tail : T H H or H T H or H H T no tail: H H H As the coin is fair, all of the eight possibilities have the same probability 1/8. All in all, p(2 tails or more) = 1/2 and p(2 tails exactly)= 3/8. Hope this helps. (sorry for bad english, french being my mother tongue.) A fair coin is tossed 2n + 1 times. What is the probability that more heads than tails are obtained? A fair coin is tossed five times. What is the probability of obtaining at least four ​tails? A coin is flipped twenty times and landed heads fifteen times (fair). What is the probability of a head on the next toss? X flips a fair coin n times, and so does Y. what is the probability that they get the same number of heads? A coin is tossed 10 times. What is the probability of getting at least one tail? Let's say we treat the result as a binary word. For example if first toss is tails, then heads then tails, we get 101.There are 8 equally possible permutations. 3 of these contain exactly 2 tails, do 2/8=25%.
I guess that depends on what kind of math you suck at! Engineering focuses on calculus and differential equations, two mathematics fields that are far different than the math most people think of when they talk about the subject. Calculus and Diff EQ are basically variable algebra with some pattern recognition and application. So you do not actually use numbers normally until the very end when things are simplified, and most problems will require you to follow a simple formula or method to get to an answer. It is in memorizing and applying these formulas or methods that people have a hard time in engineering mathematics. That being said, no undergrad will be good at Engineering Mathematics when they get to their first courses, so you won’t necessarily be at a disadvantage. I would say that to be good at engineering you need to be capable of surviving and using the following courses/information before you get to a college level class. Trigonometry Functions and Graph Theory (whats the equation of a line? how does a function work? etc) Pre-Calculus Algebra Everything else is sort of un-important I would argue. You will always have access to a calculator, so being able to like do long division or something is not at all what engineering math is about. It is about seeing a problem, and applying patterns and methods to it to get to near an answer. I study electrical engineering and I suck at math, what should I do? I am pretty good in programming, but my math sucks, how can I improve? I suck at math or anything with numbers unless it is physics. I want to be a physicist. What do I need to know about math or what is a good st... Do I have to be good at maths to do a PhD in engineering? How can I be great at math? “Sucking at math” isn't a death sentence. You can learn to be good at math. When I stared college I wasn't very good at math and I got a degree in physics and math. You can learn anything if you put your mind to it. Short answer. Absolutely. You most likely don’t suck at math, but more likely have had really crappy math teachers. Most of them are GOOD at math. Some are even stellar, but that rarely, if ever equates to good math  teaching  skills. All the other subjects can have crappy teachers, but you will still learn something. You just won’t get the full benefit as with a great teacher. But with crappy math instruction you will FAIL, or worse learn a bunch of bad habits. Math is simply a bunch of rules…. THAT NEVER change. The key to teaching math, is teaching the rules, not showing off how well you (the teacher) knows the rules. The key to learning math is recognizing which rule to use, and how. Here is a educational secret… If you show poor math skills in school. (Notice I did not say math aptitude) Especially elementary school, you will get tracked in the crappy teacher classes, all the way though high school. I watched this happen with all my kids. Plus I know a lot of math educators. All my kids had great math aptitude, but not all of them had great skills… My wife is a stellar teacher, and particularly at math. And can fix any kid that shows desire to improve. Go take some math classes at a junior college, and here is the BIG secret… DO THE HOMEWORK. All of it. Do not skip ANY math equation steps, no matter how confident you are of the answer in your head. WRITE it out. By the time I was in 3rd year calculus I was getting 100% on every test. The best engineer I ever worked with did all his homework in PEN. And get some tutoring. If you can pay for it, that is even better. “Can I be a good engineer if I suck at maths!!” Well!! Now your problem here may be of different types. It depends which type is yours. May be you like mathematics, but you can’t do well in your exam beacause of some silly mistakes you do while solving and you feel so. May be you don’t like mathematics at all. You have taken it forcefully in your 10+2. Now if you are in the first category then trust me it happens to most of us. You can improve yourself in this regard. But according to my point of view the second category students will be having hard time if they choose engineering. All the basic concepts of mathematics that we are taught till 12th starting from number system,set theory,trigonometry,calculus,co ordinate geometry, logic and reasoning etc. are of utmost importance in every step of engineering. If you are not having a good grip in these you will be having tough time. Now choice is yours. Best of luck!!
What got me my first serious writing gig was putting together my portfolio based on stuff I've written previously. Consider the work you've done for your uni newspaper, any blog posts, coursework (if you're happy with quality and variety of the things you've written) Start small. Try writing for your local newspaper or small online magazines who often look for contributions. Browse through their content and prepare a couple of ideas you can pitch. It's important to start writing, make contacts, and learn the tools of the trade of this ever-evolving industry first. Knock on as many doors as you can. Seize the opportunity! Consider fashion blogging, too. Find your style, maybe write style round-ups, celeb fashion articles and longer features? It can also help you grow your portfolio. I'd like to recommend you Aliza Licht’s book,  Leave Your Mark . She was a PR specialist for DKNY, but she shares tips about the career development in fashion in general (eg. how to network and build your personal brand) . I found it very interesting! I interviewed her - you can get a taster here:  Aliza Licht interview: How to be your own publicist? - Beside Magazine - subjectively about culture and lifestyle Hope that helps!
I’ve summed it up with the following points: The OBOR Initiative consists of two main parts: the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB), a land based route stretching from Central Asia to Europe, and the Maritime Silk Road, (MSR), an ocean-going route designed to reach from China’s coast to Europe and the South Pacific. Chinese investment projects include roads, bridges, ports, pipelines, rails, and tunnels funded by Chinese foreign exchange reserves and Chinese-back international institutions. China is motivated by its search for an outlet for excess industrial capacity to improve its economic situation, as well as its desires to bolster its position as an international trade powerhouse and sidestep US Navy superiority. The initiative has gained the support of the UN and continues to expand into new countries despite various setbacks. If you’d like a more detailed explanation, you can check out the article on  The Modern Envoy - Global Affairs Explained Simply Why there is no Indian projects like one belt one road? What exactly is the one road one belt plan? Does India need to be a part of the Belt and Road initiative? Read the details. What is One Belt One Road? What does it mean by "One Belt One Road" with respect to China? After China develops itself to certain stage, it is time for China to go out. China believes that some of the Chinese success can be replicated in certain parts of the world. If some parts of the world learn from China and become prosperous, then there are more demands from these places, and China can make more money. China genuinely believes that you do not get richer by making the others poor, you get richer when others also gets richer. China always plans its moves. It foresaw its economic power many years ago and planned accordingly. It needs a label/image that the other countries can understand. No label is better than “Silk Road”. So OBOR is the umbrella terms for Chinese intention to fully and deeply engage in the world in economics. The domination of the world is not the primary motivation of Chinese. From the history of many empires, China fully understands that it is futile to conquer the world by force. The only way to have a lasting peace and prosperity is to get rich together. If it turns out that China dominates in this process, so be it. If it turns out that India or some other country dominates, China can also live with that as long as it does not hurt China economically.
Look, friend we can never advise you whether to do or not, its risky.If you want to then go for it. BUT, before that i’ll add a few questions Do you think that all other friends in the examination hall gets the same question paper? If so, are you so lucky that a future IITian (i mean a scoring student) shall sit near you. If so,do you think you have the perfect eyesight to see his/her pattern of marking his OMR sheet? If so, are the invigilator’s blind?(i think this could be a simple task for you) If all the above does happen in favor of you, will you be happy that you scored such a good marks with his/her hard work? Or did i commit a crime of stealing his/her hard work and helped myself? After all this, can you perform up to your level at the IITs? Never expect for luck to lift you uphigh, believe in yourself. Work hard for yourself.Elders says that ‘give your best,god will do the rest’ EDIT; thanks for the 30+ upvotes…..i mean…..i never expected that my answer was so good….. IIT Madras is setting the paper of JEE Advanced 2017. What can I expect? Is it possible to cheat in JEE Advanced? How can I cheat in the 2017 JEE Advanced? What do I do in a two hour break between paper 1 and paper 2 of JEE Advanced? How tough is the JEE Advance paper? Cheating in any exam, be it a competitive or graduation exams, is considered an academic dishonesty. Why would you cheat? Study for gaining knowledge and understanding and not for snatching the success away. I strongly advise you to prepare well for it. If it takes 4 years, let it be because once you clear it by your own merit, the satisfaction and worthiness you get is precious. It isnt easy to crack mains and give advanced, it takes lot of hardwork and effort. As you already cracked jee mains, i guess you are a hardworker, so believe your hardwork and give your best and dont cheat. But if you already cheated in mains, i dont think so you need to ask this question.
Please read this two articles published by ‘Business Line' in 2013. The Marwari business model-I The Marwari business model-II I think it should give all the answers. Note: To understand word like ‘hundi’ search wikipedia. Apart from that there is book “The Marwaris: From Jagat Seth to the Birla by Thomas A. Timberg”
“Manuscript” refers to anything that has not been published yet. A “review paper” refers to a paper that provides review of literature, research, etc. specific to a subject. Before publication, that paper is a manuscript.
I am not sure how outsiders, even Englanders view the political scene in Scotland at present, although cousins in Austria think the Brits are insane over Brexit. We currently have a situation where the Labour Party in Scotland, (there is no “Scottish Labour Party”, currently running and registered in Scotland), objects to Trident, whereas the branch leader is in favour, yet down south, opposite is true. Down south, Labour are supposedly diametrically opposed to the Tories, but in Scotland, they espouse similar policies, (although SLAB can’t actually make their own policies), to the point where they committed electoral suicide by fronting a Tory backed campaign against independence, in spite of the opinions of a significant number of their members. Since then, they have repeatedly allied themselves with the Tories at both the national level, where they won’ t vote against them, or locally, where in some cases, they have tabled amendments to SNP motions, then voted AGAINST their own amendments and sided with the Tories, to thwart the SNP group. (This was in Stirling) Over the past couple of years, SLAB have seen their support plummet, in what was formerly their strongest territories, to the point where they are sometimes polling half that of the Tories. We now have the spectacle of their sole MP actually advising Labour voters to vote Tory, in order to thwart the SNP, with whom they are much more closely aligned, ideologically. As has been seen at the most recent council elections, SNP managed to become the largest party in half of the councils overall. Problem is that Labour refuse to reliquish power for the sake of democracy, and have actually allied themselves with the Tories in places like Aberdeen. Now, they have entered into a coalition with the Tories, to crowd out the SNP, who were much more popular. Some of the big Labour councils have a long history of cronyism, and corruption, such as exemplified in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. The Glaswegian Labour group are effectively refusing to vacate their offices now. This could backfire tremendously against Labour at the next general election in a couple of weeks, as it appears to demonstrate that they don’t care about democracy, and what the people actually want. Even Krazier Dugsbawz, who never appears to tire of making a fool of herself in public, to the point that she has repeatedly been corrected for blaming the SNP for things Labour actually did, or even being dug up by presenters who observed that she mentions the SNP and independence NO MATTER WHAT question she is asked, while banging on about them both obsessing about it and playing mention of it down. (Even her own father has corrected her on Twitter…lol) I would like to be able to say that even she would realise that you can’t let councillors act like that and still retain an ounce of credibility. It should be noted that although they are suspended from the party, they are refusing to stand down from their posts, in spite of the fact that many people voted for them on the basis that they were Labour members. For each MP voting against Corbyn, 1000 Labour members voted for him. Should those MPs go? Is there an equivalent US political party to the UK's Labour Party? If so, what is it? Would Kezia Dugdale make a good leader of the National Labour Party? Scotland has voted twice now against independence 1) remain in the UK. 2) remain in the EU. Why does SNP believe there is a mandate to go inde... How do I vote for the Labour leader? It is the symptom of a party without principles or policies except for its own selfish party interests, personal careers and unwarranted sense of entitlement, and blame the SNP for disrupting that. It has no policies except “Vote Labour”. While in England there has been a bit of a wave of activity among those attracted by Corbynismo (powerless, though, against an overwhelming majority of “Labour” MPs who should really be in the Tory Party), in Scotland there is only a continuing haemorrhage of Labour voters and members to the SNP, and all that is left is a tiny rump of Orangemen, municipal careerists with nowhere to go, and people who, quite simply, haven’t been paying attention. They don’t know where they are going, or what they are for. And unless they start getting used to the idea of Scottish independence and start supporting it before it actually happens, they will disappear as a historical irrelevance in the not too distant future. This is a bit ironic, given that their founder, Keir Hardie, was calling for Scottish “Home Rule”, i.e. independence within the Commonwealth, over a century ago. Depends if she means wholesale or across the board! The Tories have a better chance than Labour to beat the SNP in many seats.
Because they are convinced that their convictions are true, unique and worth to be spread to all over the world. In an educated dialogue between intelligent people, the approach, the correct one, is: “I just told you what I believe is true, now I am ready to listen and consider your point of view”. No arguing, no harsh discussion, but simply a gentlemen’s dialogue. The fight starts when you want to CONVINCE the other that he is wrong and that you are right. Nobody has to be forced to accept a point of view by force: if the point of view is valid, it will find his good way in the other person’s mind. Why do some people argue that they are God? Should people argue about religion? What is the most annoying thing about smart people? What is it about religion that people don't get? Why is it so hard to argue with people about money? People argue about their religion for the same reason that people argue about anything that they feel strongly about - attachment. When people get attached to a belief system [religious or not], and believe it to be correct under all circumstances, it causes conflict and often makes people forget what  the belief is fundamentally about [for most religions, it is living moral and loving lives]. When people get attached to a label and identify themselves strongly with something, any disagreement or opposition feels like a threat to ones dignity and identity. This is the case on non-religious topics too. You can see in history when people become too attached to ideologies it leads to terrible circumstances. Marxism and Communism is the best example. What on paper seemed like a good idea has led to the death of millions of people. Nationalism is the attachment to a flag or a country - also led to war and xenophobia etc, of which people forget that we are all human and not separate or different after all. These ideas can lead to an “us and them” mentality. “I’m right, you’re wrong”. “My worldview is better or the only worldview” [meta-narratives]. Of course if someone is very confident in their religion then they would most likely find no need to argue.

No….they can only go if ther is requirements for accounts officer. Else science students are generally preferred.
Having worked in the consulting business as well as Data Science, here’s my $0.02. Management consulting is a very wide field. A good area to explore in this field is analytics consulting, i.e. job roles that focus on using data science to solve business problems. While almost every consulting project requires the analysis of data to solve the problem, analytics consulting is much more focused. The main advantage of working in this space is that you have the opportunity to be exposed to problems in a wide variety of industries/verticals. This is extremely helpful in understanding the vast applications of data science. Moreover, working in consulting helps you build some very important skills such as understanding the problem from the client’s perspective, and presenting analyses to clients in an easy-to-understand manner. One of the most important skills a Data Scientist needs is the ability to explain their analyses to non-technical people. When you’re dealing with clients, in the majority of cases you’re not dealing with people that are interested in understanding the nitty-gritties of the algorithms you’ve used, or why Random Forests are better models etc. They’re interested in understanding how you can solve the problem and how useful your solution will be to their business. This forces you to think from a completely different perspective, unlike a traditional data scientist. A complex ensemble model with a high accuracy might be a very good model to use on the data you have, but it might not make any sense from the business perspective. This is important to understand when presenting solutions to end users. Working as a consultant for a few years will help you build this skill set that will prove to be very useful as you progress in your career. After working in analytics consulting for a while, if you’re truly interested in the technical aspects of data science such as building better algorithms, then you can switch roles. At that point of time, you will understand how analytics can be applied to various business problems, and can choose what industry or vertical you want to focus on. In my current role, the main focus is on designing better methodologies/algorithms, research on various models and how current processes can be improved using better models, etc. While client needs are still a priority, that doesn’t necessarily define the way things work. A traditional Data Scientist has more freedom to explore out of the box solutions that might not be used in a consulting environment. On a completely different perspective, one of the biggest challenges of the consulting industry is the travel requirement. For many people, consulting doesn’t hold the same charm as they progress in their lives because of this demanding requirement. Traveling to the client’s site from Monday-Thursday every week for a few months is not very exciting when you have a family or responsibilities at home. However, for someone fresh out of grad school, these restrictions might not necessarily apply. This is when you’re truly starting your career, and being in consulting will give you a chance to explore various options. These experiences mould you as a person, and can be truly rewarding down the line. Obviously not everyone is interested in such a lifestyle, but if this is something you feel you will be comfortable with, then definitely consider it as a serious option. As a data scientist, how can I pivot my career to management consulting (MBB in particular)? Why are there so many fake data scientists and machine learning engineers? Do I need to take the IIT or JEE to become a data scientist? I am working as a data scientist. Is data science and consulting relevant? How should I go about changing my profession from being a manager to data scientist? Did you enjoy your CS studies? Do you actually like working on technical stuff? In that case, data scientist would be a good choice of career. Do you prefer working with people? In that case, management consulting would be a good choice of career. There are a lot of variables to consider, and without knowing your goals, it is hard to make a good recommendation. However, I personally would recommend data science career path. But I'm biased and this could be bad advice. I have never had the title "Data Scientist", but through my career I have been a Business Analyst, Sr Analyst, Quant, Statistician, Manager of Price Optimization, and now Manager of Market Analysis. But, at the time, there really wasn't a career path for Data Scientists so I sort of stumbled my own way to where I am. But, you could say that I've taken the career analyst/manager track over the consulting track. I also have never worked as a Management Consultant. But, through my career I have worked with, traveled with, and hung-out with many of them. And the one thing that I can say is: I am glad I'm not a management consultant. But it all depends on your goals. A good management consultant makes a lot of money, especially right out of school. Probably way more than you could make as an entry-level data scientists. And it is a good way to get a lot of experience fast. Experience that you probably would never get as a career data scientist, unless you are a consulting data scientist (which could very well be an option). I emphasize "good" here, a bad consultant is quickly out of a job. But, management consultants totally quality of life is rough. They normally travel 3-4 weeks per month. Often have long-term assignments far away from home. Work 80 hour weeks, under high pressure and tight deadlines. And, in the end, except for a few, get very little recognition. If you like hotels and don't have attachments, like family or pets or a house or friends you like to see more than once a month, it can be a good career. But burnout is common. On the other hand, I'm a company man and my day goes something like. I get up in my own bed at 7am and get a shower and grab some clothes from the laundry (not a suitcase). Spend some time watching the news with my wife. Feed my dogs. Make a cup of coffee and drive 10 minutes to work. Chat with co-workers (that I've known for year, because I haven't hopped from job to job) for a bit, boot up my laptop maybe grab another coffee. Spend some time reading a few comics like dilbert and maybe check my quora feed (maybe answer a question, like today). Then I start working on whichever project I left un-finished yesterday at 5pm when I left the office. I maybe have a few meetings or phone calls with consultants where I tell them what to do, or that they missed something in their analysis. Maybe not, maybe it’s a quiet day. I go out to lunch with friends or run home on lunch. Maybe in the afternoon there is a fire drill, and something needs answered right away. Usually something comes up. At about 5pm, I go home. I mow my grass or something, walk my dogs, maybe go out, volunteer and /or relax. Some could call it boring. But, my career gives me time to find fulfillment outside of my work. My quality of life is very high and pleasant. I may not make as much money, but I'm comfortable. I've come to realize that I am glad I took the career path and not the consulting path. I've seen many people do a dual path that seems to work well. Start as a management consultant while you are young and have the energy (and maybe fewer attachments). Do that for about 5 years and then move into a career analyst/data scientist track. There are some notable advantages here. First, you make a lot of connections to help you on the way, and you can shop for the type of company for which you want to work. Second, you get a big leg up when you start at a company if you have worked with them in the past. Third, some big management consulting firms have an unwritten policy of trying to place their consultants with the companies they work for. I've seen BCG do this several times. They run a project, and then the project lead joins the company as a manager (or higher) to "continue the work". Then, new projects tend to go back to BCG. It's a valuable cycle for both BCG and the project lead. I'm not sure if any of that is an answer, because it ultimately is up to you and your goals and individual situation. It probably wouldn't hurt to pursue multiple options as you apply for positions since there is a lot a variability in what each company can offer. A good consulting firm can be a lot lower stress than a bad company. So, good luck. It's an exciting time and it's easy to get caught up in the stress of starting your career. But enjoy it. Make lots of friends, hang out, and don't take work too seriously.
Depends on what’s important to him, what’s important to you, and what you understand of each other. Is consistency important to either of you. Then it might be pointing to a problem. If you are both into artistic personal self-expression, sounds like a compliment. How do I respond when someone gives me a compliment? Is it wrong to compliment a woman on her looks when you first see her? Is saying someone to be "unusual" an insult or a compliment? What would happen if a guy takes something I say about his looks as a compliment? People say I look like Siddharth Malhotra. Is it a compliment or an unfortunate thing? That is a very odd use of the word. I’ve never heard of anyone being described as “varied” before. Maybe ask the person who said it to clarify, cause what they said doesn’t really mean anything since it doesn’t make sense. You what stubid is that you ask people their opinion about a vague word you and them are not sure about and not to ask the person who said it. Maybe he or she means something different than you get from us It depends. Varied in what respect?
Yeah you should It is the best smartphone you can buy under 10,000
India is not jealous about CPEC because India knows it will be big burden for Pakistan as well as China in long term. We are concentrated here why this is not feasible Pakistan and this answer explained most of the things. If you examine successful ports like Dubai and Singapore, they owned by their own states and developed with long term strategies. But if you check CPEC deals they are negotiated with careless manners and Pakistani leadership has shown immense immaturity, short-sightedness, and lack of good judgement in signing off on CPEC. As time will tell, the CPEC will soon become Atlas’s burden, a symbol for the world to see but for Pakistan to carry. China will get lot of benefits from it as they will have one sided deal as Pakistan don’t have any choice as a broken economy. Here are some points. Note :  if you need references for these fact please refer my following answer and the sources mentioned in these link are only from Pakistan. Shyam Bhagat's answer to Is Pakistan becoming a Chinese colony? Huge Loan  - The CPEC is based on a  $46 Billion  loan (now it  $55 Billion ) that Pakistan has taken from China under Sovereign Guarantee. From the original allocation the $11-billion amount for infrastructure purposes is a Chinese loan whereas the $35-billion investment for the power sector. Infrastructure investments offered by China for CPEC is to be  paid back as equity (ROE) which is guaranteed at either 17% or 20%.   Check this example which shows actual malpractice in CPEC Projects. With a substantial portion of the Chinese investments focused on power projects, the viability of the projects has been closely examined, based on interest rates charged by the China Development Bank and the China EXIM Bank. Official documents have revealed that with an estimated  debt-equity ratio of 80%-20% , and these investments guaranteed a 17% to 20% rate of return in dollar terms on their equity (only the equity portion, and not the entire project cost). China will recover its investment in less than 26 months, and bleed Pakistan for the 25 year contract period. Not only that, such hugely expensive electricity will cripple their economy, making them a wheelchair case. If you check some historical facts,  Sri Lanka  is one of the Prime Example. Unable to repay its debts to China, Sri Lanka is handing over the power plant,  Hambantota  port and possibly the airport to Chinese control in a debt/equity swap. China would then achieve a major objective in its ‘One Belt One Road’ project, of having a strategic presence on Sri Lankan soil by professing to offer ‘economic aid’ with no strings attached. Thanks largely to such Chinese ‘aid’,  Sri Lanka now spends 90 per cent of all government revenues to service debts . In fact, the example of  Venezuela , a politically and financially high-risk country in which China has invested over $52 billion from 2008 up till 2014, the another biggest Chinese investment in any single country so far, may hold some of the answers. It created a win-win scenario for the Chinese government by marrying off low-wage Chinese labour to long-term infrastructure projects in exchange for secure and continuous supply of oil and commodities. All the Chinese loans to Venezuela were commodities-backed, under which  Venezuela was obliged to keep supplying to China millions of barrels of oil to feed the Chinese economic boom . As well as Pakistan has nearly (in 2017)  $72 Billion  debt all together which is nearly 70% of their GDP which are not part of CPEC and  Current Account Deficit is now raised to 120% . Even currently Pakistan has raised loans at 8.75% interest rate from I.M.F. by mortgaging Motor Ways, Air Ports, Radio & TV stations. To pay interest Pakistan is taking other loans to cover it and will reach alarming levels of Bankruptcy.  Major details about this  deal kept very secretive  as  Governor of State Bank of Pakistan Ashraf Mahmood Wathra , in December 2015, had said:  I don’t know out of the $46 billion, how much is debt, how much is equity  and how much is in kind. Pakistan also has a history of fudging information and false propaganda. Recently, it was announced with much fanfare that the IMF and World bank had declared Mr Ishaq Dar as the best finance minister in the world. That was promptly rubbished by the two institutions. Again, Pakistan had  claimed GDP growth of 4.7%, after IMF corrections it was found to be closer to 3.1% .  With CPEC if you assume that the interest will be in the range of 7 % p.a, payable in 25 to 40 years, it would and mean China will have to be paid back approximately  7 to 8 billion dollars as EMI for next 43 years from 2018  onwards. Pakistan will never've in a position to pay back even the interest, forget the principal amount. One sided bids for Chinese Companies  - The contracts for investments in CPEC are all one sided,  no bid contracts against Chinese companies . There will be no Global Tenders and contracts are confined to Chinese companies with Pakistani sub contractors are the only ones who are getting the after meal leftovers that the Chinese would leave on their plates. There are also report that some of the projects are awarded to black listed companies in China, and substandard construction of Chinese Companies never sure the quality.  Khanpur  and  Nandipur hydroelectricity Power Plants  are prime examples. Preference for Chinese Workforce  - China is now having huge under-utilised capacity of industrial production and workforce. In CPEC  majority of workers, goods & materials are all Chinese . China is constructing quarters for their own work force in Pakistan. No assurances could be given that Pakistani labour would be recruited to work. So the money China is investing comes back to China and with interest. No Toll for Chinese  - Chinese trucks are exempted from paying toll tax. As Pakistan has very less to export to China, Pakistan will get very less profit from this arrangement. Under CPEC, Pakistan has to take care of maintenance and security of the road. The expenses Govt. of Pakistan has to bear from its own pocket. Pakistan plans to train 15,000 security personnel to protect Chinese workers on the corridor. Presently, 8,000 Pakistani security officials are deployed for the protection of over 8,100 Chinese workers in Pakistan. So Govt of Pakistan has to do without a single penny worth benefit getting out of it. CPEC is Plan B  - In practical, China’s  major manufacturing is located in her east , bordering the South China Sea. It is crazy enough to imagine Chinese would like to  ship goods through an at heavy risk  CPEC, when they can  ship the same goods by sea for a fraction of the cost , the ports being next door and the sea lanes much better secured. The only province that can send freight down CPEC is the Xinjiang Province. The population of that province is at this moment attacking the native Han Chinese population and and want to secede from China. The Chinese PLA is fighting running battle in the province and has been doing that for many years. Therefore  Xinjiang has very less manufacturing goods to ship to anywhere make  CPEC very under utilized. In my view point that it is the alternate route like Plan B and it only works if Plan A fails. I think it is unlikely situation. So it strategically good for China but from view point of Pakistan i can’t see any win win situation. Security Conditions for FDI  - Pakistan is facing lot of internal security problems because of internal instability and terrorism, thats why Foreign Direct Investment besides China is very low. Impact on Pakistan Industry  - China has an established track record of arriving much like a horde of locusts and completely wiping out the local indigenous industry. The floodgates to Pakistan have been opened to the Chinese and it is just a matter of time before  Cheap Chinese goods do the Walmart-effect on Pakistani industry and destroy what is left of it .  Because of  high taxation and high Electricity rates Industries in Pakistan cannot compete  with products of other countries. For example Cotton Industries in Pakistan which has major share in its exports are shutting down because they cannot compete with competing industries in China, India and Bangladesh which are providing concessions to decrease their production cost. Another big reason is China to whom Pakistan is providing favourable terms like  Free Trade and Low Tariff on products imported from China makes them cheaper  is the other major reason behind falling Industries in Pakistan. Also  Pakistan has much less to offer China for trade , on the flip side  Pakistani markets are flooded by Cheap Chinese goods  which may actually kill their traditional businesses. Lack of resources to payback loans  - Pakistani goods and services that they can offer to the world are not growing. This is well evident by their trade deficient where exports are much lower compared to their imports. Pakistan’s exports  have fallen by 15.4% in the last three years  from $ 24.58 billion in 2012-13 to 20.8 billion in 2015-16 which is compared to $44.8 billion imports causing  $24 billion trade deficit  which is very huge as  215%  more than its exports. In recent years  Foreign Remittences are fell sharply  as decline of manpower because of weakened Oil Economy and ideological tussle with OPEC countries. These incomes are vital for Pakistan Economy but they are now on downside. As there is no major industrial growth, these loans are becoming major downsides for Pakistani people. Pakistan also fudging information about increase in  Foreign Exchange Reserve which is actually happened because of borrowing from loans  from foreign commercial banks. Total foreign exchange reserves are $22 billion that include $4.8 billion of the commercial banks as well. And out of these $4.8 billion, the government has borrowed $3.3 billion from the commercial banks, called as “forward buying from the market” to be returned to them.  In Pakistan only  1% of the population is registered in the Tax System , and the  Government collects just 9% countries wealth in taxes , which is lowest in the world. This is the major cause why Pakistan Government is highly depended on debt. As competing for military supremacy with with India, Pakistan is spending  7 to 8 billion dollars on its defence budget  which also hurts the economy. Due to the constant pressure of Pakistan Military institutions, the elected government are not intervening on this amount. So after  paying interests on loans and defence budget, there is very less amount left  for development work. Environmental Destruction  - Through CPEC  China is installing Coal Based Power Plants in Pakistan which has adverse effects  on human health, do major disregard for the environment and utter destruction of ecological systems. In one side China is trying to close their own coal based power plants and they are transferring same on the Pakistani sides. Though the Hydroelectricity is cheaper but it need lot of time to build. To solve Power Generation problem as fast as possible, Pakistan don’t have any choice to accept Coal based plants which later becomes major problems for Pakistani Environment. Falling Education System  - Pakistan is  spending 2.68% of the GDP on Education , an embarrassingly low amount when compared to other countries in the region. The overall  literacy rate has gone down to 58%  which was estimated at 60% in 2012-13, shows falling Social and Living Standards as Pakistan stands at 160th in the world when it comes to literacy. Because of Islamic and Political Radicalisation in education during Jia Ul Haq military rule, the routes of quality education are shattered. The education administration is slack, corrupt and rather helpless against the student community. There are no proper checks on the functioning of the educational institutions and accountability is missing at all levels. The centuries old syllabus and foreign adopted material is another reason for degradation of whole system. Pakistani text books and syllabus still contain the old boring lessons that were adopted by text book boards a few decade back. Not acquirement of knowledge but easy questions papers and fake degrees are the aim of education for most Pakistani people. Enrolment at primary level is very low in Pakistan and most of the students, after passing primary classes, are dropped and adopt different low-grade jobs like electrician, plumber, motor mechanic etc. Currently in Pakistan there are  more than 25 million of children between the ages of 5 to 16  who are not in schools and  around 70% of children out-of-school have never been to a school.  As regards to schools’ infrastructure,  40% public sector primary schools were operating without electricity, 28% did not have toilets, 25% were without boundary walls and 29% had no access to drinking water. While 7% schools did not have any building and 43% had unsatisfactory buildings.  Pakistan’s  6% graduation rate  is very low in comparison with developed countries. Without proper skilled workforce you don’t have the capacity to run and execute similar kind of project.  Nandipur Hydro Power Plant is one of the prime example where after lot of operational failures Pakistan handed over the operations to Chinese Company. Falling Social Conditions in Pakistan  : The indifference of Pakistan’s government to health is reflected in the fact that  Pakistan spends a mere 0.9% of its GDP on health.  Only two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bangladesh, have a lower ratio of GDP to health spending. Because of the poor quality of government provided health services in Pakistan, Pakistan’s citizens rely heavily on private healthcare, which they avail primarily through out-of-pocket payments. The infant mortality rate in Pakistan is 66 per 1,000 births which is one of highest in the world. Life expectancy in Pakistan is 66 years, as compared to 68 in India. More than  40 million people in Pakistan do not have access to a toilet  and nearly 52% of the population (94 million people) in the country has no access to improved sanitation facilities, forcing them to defecate in the open and these open defecation has significant health and nutritional consequences.  Around  7 million people in Pakistan are drug addicts , while 700 people die every day in the country due to drug-related complications. More than three million Pakistanis between the ages of 15 and 64 use heroin regularly and there are almost five million cannabis users addicted to smoking high-grade hashish called ‘charas’.  Unemployment in Pakistan is closer to 8.5% and 5.3 million people still unemployed . Theres are lot of problem for this conditions. In recent years Pakistan economy creates significantly lesser jobs than required as result of failing industries and services sector. According to economists eight out of 10 new businesses in Pakistan fail within the first 18 months due to various reasons. With these are the worst conditions, Pakistan has hardly very less space for Development. Internal Instability  - Pakistan has facing lot oppositions with its provinces like Baluchistan, Sindh, and KPK. Baluchistan has history of number of uprisings for its Freedom Movement as it is lacking major share in development and infrastructure. Sindh is the major economic powerhouse in Pakistan but it is getting less amount of resources from Federal Government which is dominated by Punjab Province. KPK and Gilgit Baltistan are also facing lack of infrastructure problems. The dominated nature of Punjab province kept all its provinces its envy and they never actually united as a nation which would make them powerful.  Failure of Kalabag Dam is a prime example of lack of unity in Pakistan’s Provinces . The same thing is happening with CPEC, where every state is fighting for getting maximum benefit. Military Tussle with it’s neighbours  - Pakistan is  spending more than 3% of GDP on it’s military . Pakistan’s military ambitions are mainly India centric and to match the defence capabilities it has spend more on its Military than its development works. It also has difference with Afghanistan as it supports extremest elements who are destabilising Afghanistan. And as a Sunni background and close relations with Saudi Arabia, Iran is also keeping distance from Pakistan on key relations. Only China has maintained good friendship but Power is always come with prosperous relations with neighbours. Without participation of neighbouring countries CPEC will never be successful as expected. Corruption  - This is the number one reason of Pakistan’s Economic Backwardness. From  Military Establishments to small bodies in Government everywhere corruption  is massively involved in every development activities. The Pakistani Generals and their politician underlings who will squirrel away every dollar they could steal and invest it wisely in Dubai, UK, USA and Panama. They should not surprise anyone it is a kind of selloff like politicians did in Venezuela and Sri Lanka. No other choice to protect from India.  - Pakistan is having f ollowing the Security State Policy  and believe  India as their number one existential threat.  As India is becomes Economic Powerhouse, India is also increasing military capabilities. And in the military might, there is no comparison between India and Pakistan. Defence spendings in India is  $50 Billions in comparison to Pakistan’s $8 Billion Military budget . To balance it Pakistan always take help from other powerful nations. Like they took help from United States till 2008 till they started tilting towards India. They have no choice other than to involve China though it will not benefit them in long term. China cares only about itself no matter who it hurts. It's the same with CPEC. China will take back its loan amount one way or another. It is very much possible that  Pakistan will end up giving control of the Gwadar Port to China . Their military's sovereignty is at risk. China has already put up its naval ship and military in Pakistan to safeguard its investment. Pakistan signed CPEC with good intentions but failed to get a fair deal. Success of CPEC is also lies in hands of Chinese people because Pakistan sold your prospects to them. So if  Chinese people think they push Pakistan in loss making business like Sri Lanka to gain full control , there is nothing Pakistan can do to stop them.  China also made similar offer CPEC like loan offer to India, but India’s Politicians turned down  their offer by taking wise decision instead of trusting Chinese speculative intensions. With smarter decision India got similar investment on 1% interest from Japan which shows their diplomatic correctness. Pakistan cannot do anything as  Chinese state owned army is in Pakistan , that means Pakistan is already submitted to China. It is in favour of India as  Chinese Regime is neutralising Pakistan . Actions like arrest of Masood Azar and Chinese Navel presence in Gwadar are indications that Pakistan is obeying Chinese Orders. Only time will tell, whether CPEC will be a way for Pakistan to move towards the path of development or another burden to deal with and Like Sri Lanka, will Pakistan submitted to China, but looking conditions in Pakistan there is very little hope.

Ref :  Great Pakistani thinker Parvez Hoodboy talking about Pakistan’s Education System Why has Pakistan become South Asia's leader in economic development via CPEC for the next 50 years? What kept Pakistan from developing at the same pace as India? Has India stopped crying over Pakistan CPEC? Why will the CPEC make Pakistan a good leader in South Asia in terms of economic development? Why is India so jealous of Pakistan CPEC's great success? First of all, let me clarify your doubt that India is not at all jealous about CPEC but India surely is concerned about CPEC. There are multiple theories, multiple opinions regarding this project. It has almost become a buzzword. Let me go through a little deep so you can understand what are the concerns and how the camaraderie between two neighboring countries can put India in a bizarre predicament. If you go through the picture you can clearly point it out that China is building an alternative route for transportation of goods (And many other things too!!). Now, think of the reality. China investing 46 Billion dollars for building up CPEC project which is 3000 KMs long! As far the China’s reputation and policy go it doesn’t commensurate with their present standing. They are seriously not in the mood of donating money to Pakistan to improve their standard of living! Now, let’s delve a little deeper. Before proceeding further on this topic we should know about Strait of Hormuz. It is a  strait  between the  Persian Gulf  and the  Gulf of Oman . It provides the only sea passage from the  Persian Gulf  to the open ocean and is one of the world's most strategically important  choke points . About 20% of the world's  petroleum  (about 35% of the petroleum traded by sea) passes through the strait, making it a highly important strategic location for international trade. In this picture you can clearly see it is closer to Pakistan than India and way far from China. Currently majority of oil import of China is going through the following route: Now, if they can build a strategic partnership with Pakistan, they will get the grip of Strait of Hormuz which can a point of severe concern for India’s naval security and economy. Now, if they can complete the project as per the project timeline 2025 then they will be able to import oil directly from Arab countries to East China where the major Chinese Industrial revolution is happening within a very short span of time. Currently, nearly 80 per cent of China’s oil is transported by ship from the Strait of Malacca to Shanghai, a distance of more than 16,000 km, with the journey taking between two to three months. But once Gwadar becomes operational the distance will be reduced to approx. 3,000 km saving China almost 20 billion dollars yearly and Pakistan will get 5 billion dollars. Now the major concerns for India: Threat to Indian Occupied Kashmir as it crosses a certain part of it. So strategically, it will give China an edge and security would be a major concern for sure. China is State-of -Power country and they have the ability to Influence Pakistan’s policy and it might unofficial become 24th province of China which again will be an issue For India’s security. Strong hold of China in Strait of Hormuz which is making India obnoxious about the project as the history between China & India is not that sweet. China’s Maritime presence in Gwadar port which can be detrimental to India’s maritime and economic strategy as India also imports oil from the same region. Src:  China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Official Website Regarding Gwadar Port? Strait of Hormuz - Wikipedia CPEC to be completed before schedule: Chinese official Hope this answers your question. Checkout:  Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project - Wikipedia Thats just one project between 2 metro cities of India and some cities laying between them.  Development budget: $90 Billion I don't want to belittle CPEC potential “for Pakistan”, but unfortunately I don't have any other way to answer. So calm down, we don't jealous. In fact we would want Pakistan to compete with India in economy so that you guys don't waste time thinking all crap and do some productive work. Long ago, as a kid, I went to a Bryan Adams Show. During the show Bryan screamed from the stage “This is the most happening crowd I have ever seen!” I was quite young, I got so thrilled that for many years I truly believed that my city was the most happening one in the world. I even told this to many people from other cities. But most of them just smiled at my comment.  I thought they were “jealous” of my city,  as Bryan must have not said the same for their city. When I grew up and started attending such concerts more often, I realized almost every artist said the same thing in every city. And then I understood why people use to smile at my comment.  They were not Jealous, they were aware of the reality. Questions like this one, make Pakistan look just like me as a kid. With a $ 45Bn project some people in Pak are feeling on top of the world. And think that everyone is jealous of it. Some think that Pak will be a developed country and one of the most important country in 2–3 decades (yes people have claimed this). They have no idea about the cost of development projects and timelines. I won't spoil the party and will let people enjoy the 'feeling', till they mature to understand the reality. P.S. This answer is specific to the question. It's not an analysis of CPEC, as that is not in scope of the question. Hello,  This question is understandable if it’s coming from a Pakistani.[Am unsure who asked this question though]. The reason being that Pakistan has ONLY 1 such project that it can try to boast of which also has been donated to it by China so as to curb India & to dump it’s redundant technology in a failed state. Also, China is primarily looking to decrease its trade route distance by several thousand miles in bringing CPEC into Pakistan. One must not forget that China is slowly becoming the most polluted country & is looking to mint money by shifting its pollution bases away from it’s soil. So, India should be least  jealous  of a country like Pakistan as there are far better competitors out there that India can look up to while competing. The reason what worries India is CPEC passing through PoK which is actually a  disputed territory  & Pakistan has given access to China without India’s consent.[ How can you give something to someone which is actually not yours  ?] Hope this helps.

Bitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions or  blockchain . This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The block chain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. Bitcoin nodes use the  block chain  to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere. Bitcoin mining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady. Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by other Bitcoin nodes each time they receive a block. Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function. The primary purpose of mining is to allow Bitcoin nodes to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus. Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce Bitcoins into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a "subsidy" of newly created coins. This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating people to provide security for the system. How to mine ? First you need to buy hardware (Antminers) which will cost you more than 1100 USD and after that you have to shell around a dollar each day for electricity. Doesn’t look feasible. You have an alternate , cloud based bitcoin mining. There are mining companies who are having their own mining farms location around the globe in countries like Iceland , China . They are have thousands of antminers working together and produce huge hashrates. Now they offer these hashrates for users. You can buy hashrates from them. There are lifetime contracts / 1 year contract.But Beware , cloud mining area is having lots of scam websites which never pays. So only buy contracts from reputed companies . There are very few companies like  Hashflare.io  ,  Genesis-mining  which are pioneers in cloud mining , read about them here  Best Companies to buy Cloud Mining Contract Is it legal to mine Bitcoins? How can I find out what the Of bitcoin is? What is Bitcoin and how does it work? Is it legal? Who's behind it? How much CPU time is needed to mine 1 bitcoin? Is it worth it to mine Bitcoin?

I think the biggest problems have to do with our grounds for moral opinions, and the justice questions that flow out of these ideologies. Where do we ground our philosophies of good and evil? Essentially, societies are evolving to interpret issues of good and evil however they feel it's acceptable. This is especially true as it pertains to what is deemed acceptable on the sexual level, and also how mental issues play into criminal equations. Flowing out of this, justice becomes a difficult line to walk. What do we base our concepts of justice upon? How do we decide if an individual has done evil, and once we've decided, what is the appropriate response? Should that person experience retributive justice, or is that concept now too arcane? Is consequential justice the only true justice? What do criminals​ deserve, and how is this justly decided? On a secularist, naturalist viewpoint, there is no ultimate anchor to justice. We simply have no standard other than our vague sense of “popular opinion” by which to make important judgments about good and evil, right and wrong. When the culture shifts closer to a relativist morality (you do whatever is good for you), governments lose their moral authority. These are the biggest philosophy and political issues if you ask me. What is the most important objective of philosophic inquiry? How would Plato, Descartes, and Watts each view this? ? What are the most important philosophical problems What are some of the most important and useful philosophical ideas? Who are the most important modern philosophers at present? What do I need to know before reading Spinoza? Do I need to read other philosophers? There is only one problem sin or negative/harmful thought and action in humans there has only ever been one problem, sin was first recognised by the first philosophers 10 000 years ago and humans have been scratching their heads about it ever since, as society slides right there is much scratching at the moment. The science has only just became available to fully explain sin, at the moment it is spread through several sciences and so must be pieced together into a clear picture, very soon some well recognised bright spark will put it all together into one solid scientific theory and practice systems will develop to reduce sin until then us less bright sparks are having a go best guessing science. Always wondered why are they labeled as problems. People explain it all by the means of limits. Why not set the tone differently & jus. call it philosophical questions
I guess it is because Bran is a Warg. Warg is the best word to define what Bran experiences in the staring seasons. Warg  :  People with the ability to enter the minds of animals and perceive the world through their senses and even control their actions. In the books as well as the show we see Bran having dreams where he is  Summer,  his direwolf. He is a Warg, and he can enter Summer's mind. I feel there's a telepathic connection between the direwolves. When one of their own is in trouble, the other siblings sense it. So when  Lady,  Sansa's direwolf is killed,  Summer  along with his direwolf siblings senses it and that is how Bran wakes up, knowing something is wrong, knowing that his (Summer’s) sibling was hurt, or worse, killed. Hope this helps. :)
I once fit that description, back in the 1990’s. At the time my reasons were: I didn’t really know much about libertarianism. At a casual glance they seemed to be more about pot smoking than anything else. Conservationism, on the other hand, was entirely respectable. An optimism that the world would be a much better place, if only we got  our  guys elected. I looked at the world in a binary way, as conservatives versus liberals, not really understanding that the state itself was an agonist in the struggle as well, or that the state had its own malevolent tendencies, regardless of who was elected. Being too smart, but not smart enough, at the same time. This is probably a brain injury I suffered from attending Harvard. I fell into the delusion that getting the right smart people in the room is what was needed to solve any problems. Smart people put a man on the moon, so why can’t they perfect the economy, end poverty, end all social strife and bring world peace? Like the old saying goes, if all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. If you are smart, and are surrounded by smart people, then technocracy looks like the solution to every problem. I learned the wrong lessons from the ending of the Cold War. It was thrilling, as a conservative, to watch the Berlin Wall come down and for democratic revolutions to spread across Easter Europe. Surely this was an affirmation of conservative principles. Reagan called for the Wall to come down. It did. Therefore everything Reagan and conservatives did was good. My views were filtered by media outlets like  National Review , which had, due to personal squabbles, purged its ranks of libertarian-leaning writers and expressed an antagonism toward libertarianism. Confusion over what conservatism actually was. I read my Edmund Burke and Russell Kirk, and agreed with much of what I read. But I did not see so clearly that what was being served up as conservatism had morphed into something else, neo-conservatism, which was just more Big Government spending and social control matched with interventionist foreign policy. I did not see at the time that conservatism barely existed in America any more. Of course, I’m not suggesting every conservative makes errors like these. But that, in retrospect, is how my thinking was at the time. Can someone be libertarian, but not liberal or conservative? Can I be a libertarian and also a conservative? Why are you right-wing? If someone is fiscally conservative and socially liberal, what are they? Can someone be libertarian and an anarchist? I’m neither, so hopefully I can give an unbiased answer. But the short form is that libertarian policies and conservative policies don’t generally aim for the same outcomes, or come from the same reasons. Libertarianism (whether you’re on the laissez-faire capitalist side or the libertarian socialist side) argues for maximal political and economic freedom, maximum freedom of choice and association, and minimal state authority and police power. Conservatism (social, economic, or both) argues that traditional social, political, cultural, or economic institutions should be supported and preserved. Not surprisingly, you can see where these philosophies are not going to play well with each other. A libertarian is likely to favor women’s access to abortion and contraception so she can maximize her freedom of choice. A conservative argues against in order to retain traditional gender roles. A libertarian argues against government regulation except where any regulation is a necessary evil in order to prevent greater loss of freedom. A conservative argues against any government regulation that discourages the traditional order (even if freedom is curtailed) and in favor of regulation that supports the traditional order (even if freedom is curtailed) A libertarian is likely to argue against prohibitions of various sorts (on drugs, sex, music, or what have you) in favor of individual choice in what to consume. A conservative generally argues for prohibitions, both in the sense that “new” potential vices will be treated as dangerously destabilizing, even while old vices are left alone (LSD and weed and meth, as contrasted to tobacco, guns, and alcohol) and that prohibitions are acceptable to reinforce traditional roles (gay sex and extramarital sex, as opposed to straight married sex.) A libertarian is likely to favor reduced militarism to minimize the requisite taxes and their negative effect on freedom for the taxpayer. A conservative is likely to favor increased militarism in order to smash even potential threats to the established order. There are only two significant reasons I can see for the current alignment of libertarians and conservatives in the US. Both have made common cause to oppose many categories of regulation - libertarians because of an opposition to regulation, conservatives because they oppose the  current  regulatory regime and want to go back to a historical one, which was also rather more modest than today’s. Both have also made common cause against redistributionist taxation. Libertarians because the consider all but the most minimal taxation to support the most crucial needs of the state to be inappropriately burdensome, and conservatives because redistributionist taxation policies opposes the conservative position of the rich staying rich and the poor staying poor. Original question: Why would someone be a conservative but not a libertarian? Why would someone be a conservative but not a libertarian? Conservative in the American sense. When I was young and impressionable, I met a nice young Republican girl at a 1993 Fourth of July Party in Seattle for the local Republican Party who was quite surprised to find out how much we had in common based on my libertarian values. I told her a joke about Barbara Bush stumbling upon someone giving away "Republican puppies" in front of a grocery store. Barbara was so excited that she rushed to bring back George Bush, but by the time she got back, the sign read "Libertarian puppies." Barbara asked, "What happened to the Republican puppies!?" "Oh, . . . they opened their eyes." There's a tribalism among the conservatives I've encountered that is profoundly lacking among the libertarians I've met. That is to say, conservatives often pay lip service to libertarian values, but when push comes to shove, conservatives just don't trust the unwashed masses to think for themselves. They would much rather have a "right thinking" person in charge. All too often, conservatives are willing to form coalitions with supposedly like-minded people when individual action will serve them much better; as a lifelong libertarian, I have always been suspicious of people who purport to want the same things I want. The larger the group, the larger the inherent discord. I do not identify as (left) libertarian because I believe many libertarians inconsistently apply their values, often failing to analyse society as a system but rather viewing it as a set of separate moral challenges to be solved in isolation. There are libertarians who think they support the libertarian values of ‘non-aggression’ and ‘free movement of people’ when they oppose the restriction of ‘illegal immigration’. They claim that it is an act of aggression to prevent the free movement of Mexicans and such desiring to migrate to the USA. Technically this is true, but I think the illegals themselves  initiated the aggression. These same libertarians do not take into account that the USA is a welfare state with many public services: education, roads, hospitals, food assistance, housing assistance, cash assistance. The services were nominally intended to assist American Citizens who have in theory paid into the system but are down on their luck, such that they would eventually get back on their feet — in theory. Many illegals, by sanctioned and unsanctioned means are able to obtain the use of these public services while at the same time paying little or no taxes. Most illegal immigrants are net recipients in this way.  Therein lies the aggression illegal immigrants commit against the native USA population which libertarians often fail to acknowledge. Taking resources without agreement and without providing due compensation is called ‘theft’. It seems to me left libertarians fail to acknowledge the initiation of aggression when it is initiated by those with a place on ‘victimhood hierarchy’. This hypocrisy is why I can only identify mostly with right libertarian or conservatives. I think conservative values may be examined, like all values, but not by pseudo-intellectual non-arguments that foundationally rely on the unquestioned acceptance of futurism or Marxism.
Often, when I walk to school, I try to walk with a smile on my face. A smile, a genuine one, is a pretty good way of telling everyone around you that “ Hey, I’m happy. ” True, it’s not the same as ‘rubbing it in other people’s faces’, but it’s not like I’m hiding my happiness. However, I don’t smile because I want others to see that I’m smiling, I smile because  I’m happy . Maybe, just maybe, someone who sees my smile may feel slightly happier, and thus I have shared my happiness. Now, when someone is very happy, perhaps from a recent achievement, they are so happy that they want to tell the whole world that they are happy. They may post their achievement on social media, tell family and friends, or even (occasionally) just go out into the street and scream “ I’M HAPPY! ”. Some people may look on them and feel  un happy, because they see it as a case of ‘they’re happy, I’m not, so either they or me are doing something wrong, It must be me.’ Some see them, but decide that the happy people are doing something wrong, and feel anger or resentment. Some simply don’t care. However, some, as a result of the other person’s happiness, feel happy themselves. If I was looking at the options, I’d pick the one that gave me the most happiness. No prizes for guessing which one. Why do people want to have children? Is it true that happiness comes from within, not from people? Why do people hate each other without any reason? And why they can't do any good thing for them? Why am I such an introspective loner? Why can't I be just like other people who are happy and go out a lot and have fun? I've turned from a true introvert to someone who can't even be happy without others. However, I still have awful social skills. How do I adapt... You could turn your question around and ask: why can’t some people just be happy for other people when they are happy and successful, instead of being resentful?
Yes. One has to be a degree holder and must pass the selection process which includes majorly psychological evaluation for leadership qualities. While one is within the open age bracket, he can apear for the normal selection process for officers. Later, with certain seniority, higher rank amongst subordinate officers and years of service, one can be considered for similar selection again but for specified duties/ area of specialisation.
If you're asking which city has the best entertainment value that's a tough one to answer. Both cities have an abundance of bars, theatres, exhibitions and all sorts of interesting things to do. If you're a bit of a culture vulture or history buff though, I'd say London has the edge. Only because it's been around longer!
Answer:  Definitely YES. 10 years ago, I would love to get such a clear answer from a peer ;) If you love Finance and technology, and you have a strong entrepreneurship sense, Fintech is probably the best career you can embrace nowadays as it merges Finance, tech and taste to fix problems (entrepreneurship). Actually, the Finance sector is reshaping by talented guys with finance and computer science backgrounds, because they genuinely offer to the society the best value of finance. As you may know, the financial crisis of 2008 has been a tsunami for most of us, as we figured out that finance and the banking sector was to some extent broken. Fintechers started to use technology to offer transparency, speed, trust, collaboration, and accessibility to people and to make Finance great again! Fintech is great, It's true, believe me! haha ;) After my high school, I studied Finance mainly because of curiosity. Indeed, I felt lost as I didn't understand how our modern society works and wanted to understand the financial and economic system. I would not be honest if I don't tell you that I was also fascinated by Gordon Gekko and all the Wall-Street culture!!! After being graduated in Finance from a business school, I started my career in investment Banking ( debt and project Finance). Then, because, I wanted to understand from inside the financial market, I moved to the trading floor. I was what we call, a Hedger, a kind of trader who is responsible for covering the different financial risks of big corporates, from commodity to currencies, and debts. I really enjoyed these jobs as it was intellectually challenging and quite satisfying in term of salary. But during these years, I observed many changes in my daily work. From trading with phones to automatic platforms, my job was changing at a really fast pace. I figured out that technology was rethinking my job and redesigning my skills. So? I quit, and joined a Fintech company! Yes, I didn't want to be simply replaced by a computer, but I wanted to be part of this evolution/revolution. From then on I started to learn coding and user experience design. After months of learning, practice and sharing with smart guys, I decided to Co-found a new Fintech Startup, because I found out a problem to solve. We start  izi - Your Stock Investment Assistant To sum-up, I don't think you can learn Fintech, as it is pretty much a mindset to experience, but you should definitely learn computer science and Finance. But because you need to know where to start, and because we have only 24 h in a day, I should advise starting your major, firstly in computer science and then get some competencies in Finance. Yes, computer science is the fuel of Fintech as Fintech companies, startups need guys, developers to build stuff. Developers are the architect of Fintech! To get skills and competencies in Finance, you should get internships in different fintech startups to find what you love the much in finance. Eventually, to fulfil your entrepreneur sense, you can start, on the side, a simple project, and you will get the taste of entrepreneurship and the love to fix problems ;) I should tell you as well to participate in  Startup Weekend - Learn, Network, Startup  to feel the vibes and the pleasure of entrepreneurship. I hope my answer will help you to find your own way and get success and happiness in your future :) All the best, young fintecher !!! What is a good overview of fintech? How good is a fintech course in India from SP Jain? What's the best laptop I can buy as a CS student? What is a good minor for a marketing major? Is every Biology major student good at math? Just like you, I love technology, love finance, love entrepreneurship , and therefore love Fintech! I've had the chance to do all of them (CEO of tech startup, Managing Director in banks, started a few companies), and the question is : where do you start? I don't think many universities offer a fintech major (I helped designed the first lectures at Oxford and a Fintech programme at Imperial College, and at that time we were amongst the first for lectures , but no major) so I think you'd need to start either with a tech or finance major. I think both are fine. If you happen to like both, I'd start with coding / programming and follow lectures in finance. Good luck, and do great things in Fintech! Especially startup land won’t be too concerned about your major. I’m convinced it’s so day one in Fintech that Universities are the last place I’d go right now. Depending on your financial situation, go volunteering for the coolest fintech you can find in your area and you will be fine. That’s where the action is :)
Hahahaha hands down, good A-level grades. Universities and colleges see A levels, AP, and IB as essentially equivalent. So a perfect grade in an IB subject would basically equate to an A* in the same A level subject. So in this case, a bad IB grade is the same as bad A level grades. The opposite is true. Good A level grades are comparable to good IB grades. So to answer your question again, definitely good A level grades

As a Senior House alumnus (Class of 1973, athletic chairman and judicial committee chairman), I certainly hope that MIT has straightened out the more recent Senior House (Haus) culture. However, Senior House currently is still part of the MIT list of residence halls and the first year (freshman) choice takes place, as always, during orientation:  First Year Residence Exchange (FYRE)  Therefore, nothing has to be done until then. If another 30 rooms open up due to exiting seniors, MIT could choose to move in some upper class transfer students or others who want to relocate, and keep freshman from senior house for another year. However, MIT will maintain Senior House as a residence hall. There are not enough “bedrooms” in Cambridge to do anything truly drastic. So we wait, and hope the “smoke” clears over Senior Haus……
Hi There, I think the best way to do this is through recommendation, ask your current clients to recommend you to their friends. Tell them how much you appreciate them using your service and how your business is built on recommendations. Also ask them to write a review of your service on your Google Business page and any other free listing sites that you can sign up for. Then once you start to gain clients and your cash flow improves you can look at more target methods for your niche. I hope that helps, Good luck What are some great advertisement wars between companies? What are some of the best ways to advertise my business online for free?

My friend appreciate your question however you need to be practical in life rather than learning script writing techniques and both are important. We have to find producer's production house through their email address and creative assistant contact. While sending your synopsis make sure you have registered your script and write in very well format and only one page is needed from their side, the reason is simple some one is going to put more than crore rupees in your movie. Don't loose hope. It took me 2 year to get to know people and currently working in one of the fine production house and still trying to take my script to production house. All the best
India's jobs problem is not restricted to a few companies, mostly in the information technology (IT) sector, laying off workers due to the US visa restrictions and automation. It is a problem endemic to our economy and not the result of global trends. The jobs problem is seen mainly as a problem of the IT sector or as a result of changing technology. That's not the complete truth. India's jobs deficit emerges from bigger, long-term phenomenon. Below are the reasons why we should worry more about macro-economic factors than a few companies laying off workers. 1. More supply than demand   India has the largest number of young people in the world, adding nearly 10 million new workers to the workforce annually. That’s equivalent to roughly the entire population of the Czech Republic or Portugal. A 2014 CRISILBSE 0.10 % study expects India to create just 38 million non-agricultural jobs between 2011 and 2019. The number of workers seeking jobs far outstrips supply of jobs. . 2. Unemployment or unemployability?   India is staring at an employability crisis. Of the 10 lakh engineers a year, more than 90% are unemployable. This even as new technologies like AI-VR, machine learning and data science pose fresh challenges. 3. The export problem   Amid protectionist policies, global trade remains subdued (2.4% is volume terms in 2017 by WTO). China became the world's factory to employ its millions. India may not have that option. 4. Agri versus non-agri jobs   CRISIL estimates that 12 million people will join the agriculture workforce between 2011-12 and 2018-19 as against a decline of 37 million in agriculture employment between 2004-04 and 2011-12. Agriculture contributes around 15% to India’s GDP but employs a massive 45% of the workforce. And this turn towards agri-jobs does not forebode well for a country trying to move up the value chain to grow faster.Bear in mind that this shift to low-productivity jobs comes amid rising literacy levels (from 64.8% in 2001 to 74% in 2011) and surging aspirations. 5. Jobless growth   The economy shows no signs of distress, growing rather well at around 7% plus. But it could well be the wrong proxy for job creation. Research by CRISIL shows that for the last three years, three sectors have outpaced GDP growth: financial services, real estate and professional services; public administration, defence and community services; and trade, hotels and restaurants. Except for the third, others have low-labour intensity. Sectors with a substantive share in employment — agriculture, construction and manufacturing — have been lagging overall GDP growth. Sections of experts have prefixed India’s economic growth with ‘jobless'. 6. Rising wages   The relative advantage of wage arbitrage that once buoyed job-generating sectors like BPO has been declining. India was, till 10-15 years ago, the world’s back office with GE and American Express leading the wave. But now, as wages in India rise, MNCs are shifting work to cheaper destinations. American Express, for example, is migrating a lot of its back-office work to the Philippines. 7. No sunrise sectors   Unlike in the past, when one sector matured and faded in its hiring buoyancy, new sunrise sectors took its place, absorbing and retraining workers. For example, after IT services came telecom and organised retail. Now, at least so far, there is a virtual absence of sunrise sectors that hold out hope for job seekers.

My parents I always wanted to say “Thank you” to my parents but I was unable to do it every time. I just feel awkward whenever I tried to do that. I felt “Thank you” is a very small word to say them. Just with a “Thank you”,I felt like, I would make them as strangers.   So, I decided to show my gratitude towards them by becoming successful in my life. And by taking care of them just as they took care of me.
An average person’s liver is healthy except people with chronic alcohol abuse, long term drug use, some toxins in mushrooms, molds, viruses and other organism. So if u don't have any of the above risk and recent physical exam hasn't shown any problems, my bet is your liver is doing fine. You don't get a healthy liver, cos u already have one. If your question is how to maintain a healthy liver then my answer will be: 1. Drink less alcohol 2. Avoid long term use of medications (if possible) such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) and other unnecessary drugs. 3. Stay away from Vinyl chlorides 4. Watch what kind of mushroom to eat 5. Exercise more to prevent fatty liver Hope it answers your question. How do I get my liver healthy? Is there any food group that is good for the liver? How can I keep my liver healthy? What is the best food for liver and kidney? How can I get healthy stomach? Where can I go to get my liver panel test results "explained"? This is probably the hardest thing to answer. Everything we apply in our body, from the shampoo we use to the lotion we apply; from the medications or vitamins/supplements we intake daily; from the food we consume to the drinks we ingest; from the dirt and air we encounter in this life are all absorbed by the body and is filtered by the liver. So obviously we should atleast make the right choice in choosing what’s safe and healthy to use and eat as there is no remedy for what you are being exposed to outside of your home. Avoiding being overweight is crucial. Many who are overweight are diagnosed with fatty liver. A condition that can progress to even cancer if not addressed with a new diet. Avoid fatty meats, cheeses, hydrogenated food, alcohol. Adding liver cleansing herbs/ supplements are helpful too. Take Milk Thistle, Dandelion, and Turmeric Supplements, You can reverse this condition without medications if you adhere to recommended diet and supplements.
Why is everyone so worried about their life style? It is not their lifestyle which made them successful. It is their mentality to not give up. They fought against the odds, worked hard, Never give up even after everyone said they should, failure couldnt bring them down- and te ta da daa.. they became successful. Routine life style is for people who mostly do 9–5 jobs. also their lifestyle will depend on which level of success they are in. We cant find a general lifestyle in successful people. at each level of success they will be having different lifestyle. Also success is different for different people. For some it will be a match, for some it will be monitory, for some it will be finding their true love, for some it will be education, or kids, or bringing together their life. Everyone have to follow their own unique way as destiny leads them. Have the courage to face odds in life- we all will be successful.
RCB Team were Runners-up in the 2016 Indian Premier League. But every year they are winning the hearts of all the viewers and fans across the Globe. Read—→>>>>>  RCB Team 2017 Players List But Unfortunately, RCB Team did not win any IPL Season. But they were Three Time Runners-up in IPL Seasons. They have reached nearby to obtain the IPL Cup on a few IPL Seasons but failed and will be looking to set the record straight this time. My favorite team  RCB Team 2017  which are super powerful now with Gayle, AB De Villiers, Virat Kohli, Mitchell Starc and Shane Watson added to the batting firepower. But RCB Team 2017 is very bearing from bowling. They have the critical bowling line up excluding Fast bowler Mitchell Starc. —————————Do you Want RCB to Win IPL 2017?———————- Which team can you predict will win in IPL 2017? Can RPS win IPL 2017? Will RCB win IPL 2017? How can RCB win the IPL 2017? Who will win the 2015 Indian Premier League? Looking at the points table at this point of time, the favorites seem to be KKR and SRH. Also MI seem to get into mood as we progress towards the business end of the tournament. We are almost at the halfway point in the tournament and all the teams have played a minimum of 5 matches. So right now, rather than who will win, who won’t win would be very apt. Let me list the teams as per their chances to win in descending order : KKR - They have a strong batting unit. No doubt. As far as bowling unit, we cannot trust the likes of Umesh yadav. However they boast of Narine, Kuldeep and Coulter-Nile. Their chances are bright for being a prospective winner. SRH - Again. They have proved to be a strong unit beyond David Warner. Seeing the kind of innings from Williamson last night, I believe they have enough firepower to face a strong bowling attack. If yuvraj starts firing, then only god can save the opposition. SRH boasts the strongest of bowling units. MI - Only now Hitman is getting back to form. Otherwise this team is saved only by their young brigade in the form of Rana and Pandya brothers. Also the likes of Malinga, Pollard and Bumrah seemed a bit inconsistent with their trades, easily negotiated barring a couple of games. MI is known for their surprises in the latter stages of tournament. Fingers crossed. RCB - Now this would be the team that most of us would have routed to win the tournament before the start of the tournament. Certainly not now. Two consecutive losses to lesser known teams in their own fortress Bengaluru should have severely dented their confidence. Injury worries for ABD, form woes of Gayle until last game were all major concerns for RCB. Also they don’t boast a dominating bowling attack as well. Except Chahal everybody else has been on and off. But, this team is still dangerous. I personally back them, even though they are lagging behind. These guys are dangerous unless injury hits them. KXIP & DD - Both the teams are similar. Started well with consecutive wins. Faltered midway, struggling now. Their prospects are low considering the above mentioned teams, but still they may spring a surprise to get into the playoffs. Only god knows..! GL & RPS - Actually, more than the crown, the wooden spoon position seems to be in high demand. Both RPS and GL have been playing a league of their own. Even RPS we shall forgive citing the kind of talent they have. Very young domestic players except a few. But GL, not even in their wildest dreams would have thought to be in the last spot. Everybody in form, but still losing. Might be some kind of bad luck. If they are making it to the semis, its either a miracle or match-fixing..! (Just kidding) My personal favorites are still RCB and KKR. The two times IPL and CL Champions,  MUMBAI INDIANS  is the most stable team in IPL this year. Even Harsha Bhogle is backing this team to lift their 3rd IPL title this year. Talking about Batting line up : ROHIT SHARMA : The captain leading from the front. Holding the record of maximum runs in an ODI inning. He is among the top scorers in IPL, a perfect match winner. PARTIV PATEL : This man is back in his form, seen him in deodar and vijay hazare, scoring tons of runs. He would be quite handy this year. LENDL SIMMONS : The West Indies Batsman is an excellent opener for MI. He has proved his power hitting a lot of times. AMBATI RAYUDU : No. 3rd position belongs to this man. Although he has not sealed a place in the Indian squad but in the mumabi he is a match winner. JOSH BUTTLER : England has produced a lot of power hitters and one of them is Buttler. Last year he has showed his skills and this year he would definitely be waiting to hold his willow back in IPL 10. KIER0N POLLARD : The power hitter of Mumbai Indians. The star of West Indies. The man who has the power to hit majestic boundaries even from the tip of the bat. He is a handy player down the batting order. KRUNAL PNADYA : He has scored lots of runs batting up the order in domestic this year. Mumbai would definitely utilize his power hitting. HARDIK PANDYA : Another Pandya who has showed his power hitting a number of times both for Mumbai and India. He is a perfect player to bat at no. 6 or 7. ASELA GUNARATNE : Jayawardene’s influence has brought the Sri Lankan power hitter in Mumbai’s squad. He is a batman who has the ability to finsh the games for his team. SAURABH TIWARY : From the Virat Kohli’s Under 19 world cup winning squad, this man has not gained the fame and name he deserved but no one could neglect his batting skills and his power hitting. HARBHAJAN SINGH : The man who has earned his name in power hitting. He has the ability to increase the run rate in the death overs. Now the Bowling department : Mumbai has always been known for the furious bowling line up. Check it out : LASIT MALING : The T20 World Cup winning captain for Sri Lanka is always the first choice for anyone when ever there is a talk on the shortest format of the game. No doubt he is the best bowler of IPL. His yorkers, his slowers, bouncers and his variations make it very difficult to hit runs. MITCHELL JOHNSON : The Australian Star Bowler is back in the squad. The furious bowler would be very handy this year. His aggression would be the perfect way for Mumbai to start their bowling attack. JASPRIT BUMBRAH : The world No. 2 T20 bowler is in the Mumbai squad. He is the best bowler of India in the death overs and he has proved his worthiness a lot of times. He would help the team saving those crucial runs in the last overs. MITCHELL McCLENAGHAN : The New Zealand seamer is a real match winning player who has the ability to strike early and keep the opposition under pressure with his variations. TIM SOUTHEE : Another New Zealand fast bowler who has showed his skills a lot of times and would definitely like to rain wickets this year. HARBHAJAN SINGH : The Indian spinner who has a majestic name in this game. He is no doubt one of the best spinners India has ever produced. KRUNAL PANDYA : Left arm spinner is the requirement of every team and here comes the name of the elder Pandya Brother. He could strike crucial wickets and could bowl in those middle 6 - 8 overs. HARDIK PANDYA : India vs Bangladesh World T 20, who could forget that match. Hardik Pandya is a match winner. KIERON POLLARD : A perfect all rounder for Mumbai. This West Indies hunk has produced a lot of match winning performances. KARAN SHARMA : He is a good spinner, he has the ability to take crucial wickets. If given a chance he would be handy. ASELA GUNARATNE : An all rounder who is very good with the bowl. He has produced very good innings for Sri Lanka. Fielding department : Lendl Simmons, Kieron Pollard, Rohit Shrama, Hardik Pandya, Josh Buttler, Mitch Johnson, Krunal Pandya and a lot of other names as well. Under the leader ship of the legend, Jonty Rhods this team has done pretty well in fielding department as well. I guess the playing 11 should like like this : LENDL SIMMONS/JOS BUTTLER PARTHIV PATEL (Wk) AMBATI RAYUDU/ NITISH RANA ROHIT SHARMA (c) KRUNAL PANDYA KIERON POLLARD HARDIK PANDYA HARBHAJAN SINGH MITCHELL JHONSON/ MITCHELL McCLANGHAN LASIT MALINGA JASPRIT BUMBRAH Support Staff : Sachin Tendulkar  : Icon Mahela Jayawardene  : Head Coach Robin Singh  : Assistant and Batting Coach Shane Bond  : Bowling Coach Jonty Rhodes  : Fielding Coach Rahul Sanghvi  : Team Manager Afzal Khan  : Assistant Strength & Conditioning Coach Dr Nitin Patel  : Physio Paul Chapman  : Trainer Amit Shah  : Sports Massage Therapist Shyam Sundar Jayapalan  : Assistant Physiotherapist A nice combination of Batsmen, All Rounders, Bowlers this team seems very handy this year. They have the ability to lift the trophy and I am backing them. For me MUMABI INDIANS has the strongest line up in IPL 2017. They have a fair chance of winning the title for their 3rd time this year. Indian Premier League  – IPL is the Twenty20 cricket tournament where franchise team participates for the title. There are eight teams in IPL10 that are going to play against each other to be final winner of IPL Tenth (Vivo IPL 2017). Here are names of Eight teams:- 1)  Delhi Daredevils (DD)   2)  Mumbai Indians (MI)   3)  Rising Pune Supergiants (RPS)   4)  Gujarat Lions (GL)   5)  Kings XI Punjab (KXIP)   6)  Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)   7)  Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)   8)  Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) Anything goes in T20 contests once 4 teams reach the playoff stage. What team do you think were the real champions of this season? Why? Which team has very good chances to win IPL 10th Season? I think RCB WILL WINNER THIS TIME IN IPL 10 please verdict Ipl twenty 20 top and lowest team by no. like no 1,3,5 and very lower team is. till then  Watch Vivo Ipl 10 Live Streaming 2017 I believe there will be a high probability for MI, KKR and SRH to win the trophy. These three franchises have a balanced side in both bowling and batting and they've the character required to win the trophy. MI  has a balance squad at the moment, they're not making any huge changes with their top order overseas players. They even have Mitchell Johnson in their bowling attack who had a fantastic BBL earlier in this year. At the very moment they're on the top of the table winning 3 out of 4 matches. Even the first match was close but they lost to the class of Steve Smith who's in an breathtaking form. KKR  it's a beautiful franchise , it is one other team which has a very balanced side for a long time. Unfortunately their opening batsmen Chris Lynn is injured, not to mention he had a fantastic BBL and is the man of the tournament. They've good overseas replacements too. The Indian players in the squad itself is very strong. SRH  are the defending champions , they've a good balance in the squad. They've found this balance once yuvraj solidified the middle order. They've Kane Williamson who's one of the best batsmen in the world. They've one of the best bowling line up with which they won last years trophy. They've Chris Jordan or Rashid Khan to backup for Fizz if he fails. Once you've the balance in your side , there will be confidence and momentum which is very important in this format of the game. I believe two of those three will be in finals, however it depends on other circumstances too. My heart goes with SRH.
The two religions have completely different bases: Islam has two major aspects: legalism (following pre-set laws and proscriptions) and asceticism (abstaining from certain activities or substances). Christianity in its fundamentals is neither legalistic nor ascetic although certain religious groups have adopted both legalism and asceticism as sectarian distinctives. The clearest statement of that difference in recent years came from a person that many evangelical Christians regard scornfully, Barack Obama: According to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned. Grace is not merited. It’s not something we deserve. Rather, grace is the free and benevolent favor of God – as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings. Grace.  The moment Barack Obama summed up the mood of a nation after the murder of 9 black church members The knock against Christianity ( a very small percentage even follow basic tenets ) is particularly true to someone who lives a life based on submission to a creed that defines virtually every aspect of life and relationships. There are really only two ironclad tenets to Christianity, to love God and love one another: (“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment.And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” Matthew 22) While the one credo is based on freedom, the other is based on voluntary submission (Islam means voluntary submission to Allah).
Auction vehicles are “As-Is, Where-Is” and there is no Dealer Assurance or Warranty included with these vehicles. If you are seeking a Project with no expectation of operation or reliability, you can find some deals at car auctions. Just remember there are no guarantees or promises that what you are buying will operate once you leave the gravel yard without the money you paid. If you want a Reliable Vehicle you can operate with little or no maintenance, there are 1000’s of used-car dealers who can offer some assistance, maybe even a service agreement if there becomes a mechanical issue. Most states regulate sales guidelines for a Dealer to obtain a Sales License. I have purchased vehicles at auction, not to drive, but for available parts at a reduced cost over retail supply houses. (Auction vehicles are usually deemed “Wholesale” by dealerships where they are taken-in as trades & can not be sold to the public without major work or repairs beyond the value.) Buyer Beware & go to an auction prepared to spend more than is needed. Are car auctions the best place to buy cars from? Is an auction a good place to buy a used car? Is buying cars at an auction risky? What is the best used car to buy for cheap? How much do dealerships buy used cars for from auction? Can I know this when making an offer? I would say no unless you have mechanical knowledge that lets you determine if the car your’re interested in only needs maintenance or minor repairs or if it may have a big and potentially expensive problem. Most people think that they are making the deal of their lives buying at a public auction, and the truth is that most of those auctions are where car dealers dump the trade-ins that they can’t or aren’t willing to sell for some reason (usually an underlying problem that requires too many time or money to repair, frame damage, rust, etc). Other case can be that you find a non-desirable model (an old Geo Metro or a base stick shift Mazda for example) with decent maintenance and no major issues that the dealership decided to dump at the auction because it’s easier to get rid of. I bought a 2008 Kia Rio, base model and stick shift that only needed brake pads and rotors but was mechanically sound. Bottom line, auctions are not for everybody. If you are mechanically inclined and can spot a flower in mud pond MAYBE you find a decent car, and in any case, have at least a grand saved for auction and documentation fees (this is non-negotiable) and any possible repairs or maintenance that the car WILL need. Generally Auto Auctions are for dealers only as you need an auction license if you operate a car lot or dealership . But buying a used car from an ebay auction is entirely different since its available for consumers. I have bought a couple of cars at an auction. I have always bought ‘cheap’ cars. Recently, the charges that the auction house charge, have made this type of buying unrealistic. Although there is a livestock / car auction house nearby which I could go to. My theory is that cheap cars are more likely to be genuine. Often dealers getting rid of trade ins. I was chatting to a man in the trade. He bought one nice looking car at the auction. It broke down before he got it home. He sold it for scrap. He paid quite a lot of money. His partner’s car had a warped cylinder heat. She returned it to the dealer and got another car at the end of the contract. That car was sent to the auction by the dealer. Until it closed, there used to be an auction house at the back of my house. It meant that it was easy to go. Watching what goes on, is an important part of the process.

really？China has accepted too many refugees who are wa，shan，kokang etc。if they are Muslim，generally speaking，they are not welcomed。yes，these refugees may be thought as Chinese more or less。why？because these area belonged to China。during wwii，UK occupied these area and sent them to Myanmar。that is why there is a civil war which lasts 67 years。
Take a shoe box and cut out the ends; put one dolls feet out one side, another doll’s head out the other — and show her that there was no one in between. Can a magician saw a woman in half lengthways? Was it a nightmare or something else? Did you have a nightmare about horses? What should I do about my 4 year old  daughter so she start to sleep on her own bed all night long? She said she had nightmares in her room! I have a horrific nightmare about the creatures spitting acid at old people and then they burn to death. What’s the meaning of my dream? Google “Penn and Teller saw a woman in half”. There are videos in which they demonstrate how to do the trick, using clear plastic boxes. These can also be searched on YouTube.

I believe in these two principles and I try to live up to them, even though it's not always easy. Make sure that what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony. Your main purpose should be learning over anything else. I believe you should do what you say: you have to be rigorous and consistent over time. This is a principle of honesty and coherence towards yourself. The second one has to be intended in the broader sense possibile: you shouldn't be studying all your live (if you do not want to). I am just trying to say that you should look for experiences and readings and friends and so on keeping in mind that they should  broaden your knowledge or give you a different point of view on reality rather than those you already posses (and are in line with your ethics). Last, remember that you need to pause sometimes. We too, as even machines do, need to relax. Just do what you feel you are up to, but always try to aim a little bit higher every time. I hope this helps! What do you do for your living life to the fullest? Why do we not live life to its fullest? Are you living life to the fullest or are you just full of it? How can I live life to the fullest as a teenager? What made you happy today? A few that come to my mind: Live every moment fully. This moment you will Never Ever get back again in your life :-) Love yourself completely without judging yourself and forgiving for all past mistakes, knowing that you are a ‘Work in progress’ like any other human being is. To err is human , but yeah, learn from the mistakes and Grow. Never abuse yourself or become addicted to anything. Invest in your own development, peace (meditate if possible) and wellness ( attend to your physical/ emotional disorders and exercise regularly to keep fit) Love others truly and unconditionally by not judging, letting them be and have the space they need, not forcing them to be someone else just so they can earn your love and attention. Help others in whatever way you can. Whether you are a lamp or a candle, the light most certainly spreads and helps the other, if in dark Make goals/ dreams and invest yourself in achieving those, but not at the cost of other responsibilities or relationships Your loved ones need you too just like you need them. Work, money is important but sacrificing them or time with them is too heavy and irreversible cost to pay. Stay at any ashram for a   week meet swamijis you'll find at least one person from a welloff family just talk to him/her and ask what gives them happiness. Now go to some remote village and   spend some time there with kids of age 6-10 . You'll most probably find what ever those swamijis said is already with this kids. As we age our imaginary chains that we are imprisoned with will also grow (insecurities) Everything you need is already within you But the best way to find purpose of life without wasting time is by devoting it to the service of others. I hope I made sense.
It will be China first, followed by India later. Let me remind you  Marshall Plan  which directly establish America, a superpower after World War II. This project costs approx $13.3 billion and completed within 4 years. The amount was invested to rebuild war-devastated European regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, make Europe prosperous. For the United States, the Marshall Plan provided markets for American goods, created reliable trading partners, and supported the development of stable democratic governments in Western Europe. Now, lets discuss to  Belt and Road Initiative China already did a revolution in cheap manufacturing, so they need bigger market for their product. Hence, the countries from which one belt-one road is passing through, their market will be over-captured by Chinese goods. How China's 'Belt and Road' Compares to the Marshall Plan Marshall Plan stated that European countries being aided should accept U.S. investment and import U.S. goods. Over time, the U.S. dollar has become a tool for stability. China is also seeking to increase the international use of its currency. The endpoint of OBOR is located in Europe. It shows that China wishes to intensify relations with traditional U.S. allies in Western Europe, which in turn undermines U.S. influence in the region. India position between all these drama. India is pushing its own  North–South Transport Corridor Japan is expected to join the Indian foray into the expansion of Iran’s Chabahar port and the adjoining special economic zone. In eastern Sri Lanka, India & Japan are expected to jointly expand the strategically located Trincomalee port. They are also likely to join hands to develop Dawei port along the Thai-Myanmar border. Declining Power: Presently, China has a strength of $10.87 trillion where as India has $3 trillion. It is expected to overcome China by 2050. China experienced a meteoric rise in its economy, reaching years of continued growth in excess of 10 percent. Those days are over. China’s most recent quarterly growth was just under 7 percent, with projections continuing to decline over the next decade and beyond. Sustaining the growth of China’s military and economic power will become more difficult, and will soon begin a slow and potentially unrecoverable decline. And, then India will start playing her role. So, China will become superpower but will not be able to sustain for long. Thanks for reading such a long post. Is China the next India? Which country, if any, is poised to become the next superpower? Who should be the next superpower.? Is India the next China? Why is China a superpower and India just a competitor? I think India will be the next super power WHY NOT CHINA ?  : 1)China has a massive bubble economy  =It is on the verge of collapsing .It has for years manipulated and inflated the numbers in various provinces .It’s actual growth rate is below 4% The Chinese government finally admitted that its economic data was made up Chinese Officials Admit They Faked Economic Figures 2)Less exports will hurt the already fragile Chinese economy  = Growth in many western countries are saturated .With the presidency of Trump ,the Americans are going to impose more import duties on Chinese products to help their economy and to create more jobs in America but these increased import duties will badly hurt the cheap export industries .Since Chinese depends on their exports and has a major share on their G.D.P ,declining exports will make the Chinese government to cut spending on social welfare Trump hikes import tariffs=less demands from Americans=less exports from China=less demands for local manufacturing in China=less profits and revenues for Chinese industries=more job loses= more stimulus measure=less welfare spending . China posts worst export fall since 2009 as fears of U.S. trade war loom China Has More To Lose Than the U.S. Under a Trump Administration 3 )Aging population of China  =Less workforce Because of the one Child policy ,the growth rate and demands are going to go down ,With more and more people joining the above 70 camp ,the welfare spending and pension programes will dent a huge in the already dwindling reserves of the communist government China’s Twilight Years China's Aging Population Becoming More Of A Problem 4)China’s ghost cities Kangbashi  New Area, a district of  Ordos City , was intended to house one million people, but soaring property prices and lack of infrastructure deterred residents of Ordos  from relocating to the newly built-up area, and it now stands largely deserted. This is one of 1000s of many hastily built ghost cities but no one is occupying it .That means the real estate markets are already down and this is how the Spanish economy collapsed in 2007–2011 .It is just a matter of time What Will Become Of China's Ghost Cities? http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/a... Flow of money out China China will ‘keep bleeding money,’ UBS strategist says China Adds Curbs on Pulling Money Out of the Country Investors are pulling out the money from the Chinese economy .It is for the first time since 1980s ,the money outflows outpaced the money inflows .It means the people already know something terrible is going to happen China is BIGGEST threat to world economy and WILL crash soon, Harvard professor warns The end of the Chinese dream? Column: Is China’s economy a house of cards? China’s economic problems will come to a head in 2017 I am not a harbinger of bad news but slowly and surely big hurricane is coming .No amount of stimulus programes and devaluation of Yuan will prevent it Chinese economy is based on weak fundamentals ,it is like a old man whose one leg is on coffin and other leg on a banana peel . Since it has become obvious excerpt from Aljazeera “The ill fortune of the new city of Shenfu reflects China's economic woes.Local government spent $16m building the city's 60 storied monument the 'CIRCLE OF LIFE' which was intented to attract tourists.But with economy faltering few have come and many Shenfu's building projects have stopped” In a First view my answer is - No. A superpower country is a combination of strong military might, economic dominance, political influence ans mostly a cultural hegemony. (human development , education and internal peace is not directly associated with term superpower.) Just google and it is easy to find various data, reports and graphs to compare the above parameters among different major countries. Also, existing value, growth rate and future expectations can be shown by various charts, graphs and facts. In military might, US is only country which has commands distributed into globe zones and not in national zones. It reflects the meaning that US has direct planning and preparedness to fight all kinds of war at virtually any place in the world. The technical advancement and innovation of US is known to world. US military expenditure is more than the same of next 12 countries combined together!!! India is not like Russia (better say USSR, before 1991) which had highly centralized command and a will to invest highly in military strength. India is not like China which has capacity to invest heavy money for defense import and developments. Read in detail at  Who will be next superpower ? India or China Technically China is already a superpower, (permanent veto member of the UN) and India is becoming a super power, in terms of military strength, naval capacity, army reserves, nuclear warheads, GDP, and so on. It will take quite a few years before we can catch up.
You have a considerable chance to get a medical college through 85% state quota. Though you wont get a reputed college. But you know anything can happen. This time the cutoffs will rise higher so it is also possible that you may not get a govt college. Be prepared for both the situations and  Expect the Unexpected. Good luck!!
Off the top of my head (I’ve split them into groups based on how I’d rank them but within each group they are in no particular order): Imperial College London (for STEM) London School of Economics (for social sciences) then University College London St Andrews (apparently if you are in Scotland St Andrews is basically seen as the Oxbridge of Scotland, in England it is seen as good but not near the level of Imperial or LSE) Warwick Durham Bristol Bath Exeter then KCL The universities which are the name university in a major British city, e.g. the Universities of Birmingham, Edinburgh, Manchester or Leeds (not to be confused with the post-1992 universities with similar names such as Birmingham City, Manchester Met or Liverpool John Moores). Any university in the  Russell Group  I haven’t mentioned yet Surrey Loughborough Lancaster These universities are a combination of picks from the top of the league tables and the ones which are genuinely talked about and which I have the perception of being ‘better.’ Which universities are perceived as better is very subjection, and varies by region, e.g. Londoners will often have better perceptions of London and southern universities than northern universities. For instance, I’ve never hear anything about Lancaster, but it is usually highly ranked, so I assume it must be good and is probably well known in the North. This is even more accentuated in Scotland, as most Scottish students choose to study within Scotland as university is free there, so they have their own scale where St Andrews would be #1, Edinburgh would be #2 etc. and they often wouldn’t consider non-Scottish universities, whereas to non-Scottish students those universities would be lower down. (Sorry for virtually ignoring Wales and N. Ireland, but I can’t really think of any top universities, also they have a lot smaller population.) How do Oxford and Cambridge compare to Harvard and Stanford? I want to be a cosmologist. Should I study in MIT or University of Oxford or Cambridge? What are some of the good universities in the UK other than Oxford and Cambridge to pursue a Masters in English? Is Oxford the best university in the world? Can you, through any means, apply to both Cambridge and Oxford? The 2017 Times Higher Education Supplement lists them as: 1  University of Oxford 2  University of Cambridge 3  Imperial College London 4  University College London 5  London School of Economics and Political Science 6  University of Edinburgh 7  King’s College London 8  University of Manchester 9  University of Bristol 10  University of Warwick There are all sorts of criteria as mentioned elsewhere and many are popular for reasons other than academia (Exeter, for example). I noticed that Edinburgh was missing from other choices but it is top notch, in a beautiful and vibrant city and ranks 27th in the world. You might find this useful:  University league tables 2017 In no particular order: Imperial College London University College London London School of Economics and Political Science University of Warwick University of Manchester SOAS University of St. Andrews You can try searching on Google the Russell Group Universities.
Certainly your GPA and SAT score are a good start. But this past year Stanford had more than 40,000 applicants and accepted less than 5%. So academics alone doesn’t cut it in the admissions game anymore. You need a hook, a spike, a way to stand out in the crowd of outstanding high school students with impressive academic credentials. Start the process of deciding what your hook is by asking yourself how are you different (in a good way) from the typical Stanford applicant who is a valedictorian or a class president or a captain of the football team or women’s lacrosse team? Why would Stanford want you and not them? Can you state your case in an interesting and compelling way on your essay and responses to Stanford’s supplemental questions? If you blow these off, you can pretty much assure yourself of a rejection email. Do you understand the Stanford culture and can you convince the admissions office that you are a perfect fit for this culture? You need to organize your entire application around this one principle - you will bring value to Stanford. Your letters of recommendation need to support this notion. Your narrative needs to expose in an interesting and thoughtful way the value you will bring. We already know you are an outstanding student. Now show Stanford that you are an outstanding person as well.
You can get direct admission in college on the basis of your class 12 marks.You need to fill up the form and submit along with all your details then you be called by college administration according to seats available.
Recently (in the last few months or so) a story broke about an active duty Navy SEAL, who had made a number of porn movies in his spare time. I think he had made about thirty films or so. Because he'd done it in his time off and used a stage name, there was some controversy. The clincher though was that in his contract with the US government, there was a clause which prevented him from moonlighting without explicit permission from his CO. Basically, this clause meant that he could wait tables at a diner but that he was supposed to clear it with his boss first. He didn't do that, and got busted. Using this as a precedent, if one got explicit written permission from a CO and it didn't interfere with his duties… then maybe he could. But good luck getting an officer to sign off on that. I don't remember seeing a follow-up on the story. Edit: So, I decided to Google the story. My memory served pretty well, except he only made 29 movies. Decorated Navy SEAL moonlighting as a porn star
Among other things, I'm also make money by writing, promoting affiliate products and selling physical products online.  My advice would be to put blinders on. I know this sounds a little strange but, unless you're VERY good at learning many different things at one time and taking on many different roles and projects at one time, the best advice is to put on blinders. Develop a laser=like focus for one project. Let's say you want to start an e-commerce business. Break that into smaller pieces and focus on each piece with everything you've got. If you don't, you could get quickly overwhelmed, get burnt out and decide to quit before you really begin. Eventually, you'll be able to hire people to do some of the smaller things (think of these jobs as the $10 an hour jobs you would pay someone to do) to make things easier and allow you to focus on the $20, $30, $40, and $50 an hour jobs until you work up to the $100 jobs you should be focusing on to grow your business. You will have more success starting with one idea and sticking with it instead of flitting around from thing to thing.  I hope this helped. How can I remain motivated to get my business to work? How do I stay motivated? How should I get motivated to hit the gym every day? Self-Improvement: How can I motivate myself to work hard? I am 28 and want to start career in sports. Is it possible? How do I get motivated for this? Someone shared this in one of the other posts of Quora and it should help you to find how to get tarted. Beside that, I think that the best way to learn something new is to learn with others by sharing your progress with others on a blog. It will help you in many things; you will be accountable to others since you are *teaching*. You would eventually be considered an authority and on top of it it could help you to get next big job or project. Something similar I started[1] couple of months and it's helping me a lot. [1]  LxD | Adnan's Random bytes Just know that if your making a new business, it's YOUR business. So b creative and unique, and do what you feel will make u money. That's my personal opinion though. :) Ask yourself WHY?? you want to start your business.. Is it to change your lifestyle, is it for money, is it for freedom? Or is it so you can start your own success story and stop working on some else success story?? If your WHY?? is Big Enough that is all the motivation you need. My WHY?? when I started my business was to have more freedom and start my own success story.
What would happen if China “ forced ” Vietnam to stop having relations with Taiwan ? : I suppose we laughed our asses off is an "unofficial" version. Hanoi adheres to a one-China policy and officially recognises the People's Republic of China only but that can not stop the relationship between Taiwan and Vietnam growing. Vietnamese people can get visa to Taiwan no problem Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Vietnam You also can displays the flag of the ROC and its national emblem in Vietnam as you like. But ofc according to this article :  中越签署新公报 越南对封杀台湾新南向开了第一枪  . Well done, Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Propaganda Department 中共中央宣传部 , Really ? lol Is Taiwan part of or separate from China? Did countries like China, Koreas, Taiwan, and Vietnam have samurai or was that only in Japan? What will happen if Vietnam recognises Taiwan instead of China? Does China need Taiwan anymore? If China's mainland and Japan are at war, which side will Taiwan pick or how many choices does Taiwan have? Vietnam is a sovereign state, so legally, China can’t really force anything. China would need to give a pretty strong and real incentive that Taiwan can’t match for Vietnam to stop having relations with Taiwan. It’s not worth going to through the trouble for something quite minor. What are the benefits? Vietnam is one of targeted countries in the phase of Taiwan New Southbound policy which seeks to forge closer trade and economic ties. Vietnam is a sovereign state, so literally no one can forced us to do this or that. What’s next ? Stop having relations with Japan ? Stop having relations with USA ? Stop having relations with India ? …………. Oh pff Yes Vietnam adheres to the one China policy , but we will not stop having relations with Taiwan ! This is a false question. China won’t force anyone to stop relations with Taiwan except diplomatic relation and military relation. Vietnam does not have sucn relations with Taiwan. A few days ago Vietnam re-announced it’s against Taiwan’s independence and support China’s re-unification. So it’s already happening. Also note China supported Vietnam otherwise there would be 2 Vietnams today.
Okay, okay, so let me get this straight. Your  best friend died in a car accident,  and your parents found out and  got angry, and told you to grow up. “Is it stupid and immature to cry after a best friend died in a car accident?” HELL NO.  Your parents honestly need serious help. I’m so sorry that you’re going through this. You shouldn’t have to deal with that bullshit. . . . (very discreet edit) this got on the quora digest? holy crap Why did my friend die in a car accident at the age of 22? The son of someone I know died. In a car accident. What do I say when I see her next? My wife and two sons died in a car accident today. What should I do first? Why does one need to see a chiropractor after a car accident? What makes you cry more, a dog dying or your best friend dying? NO it is not stupid and immature to cry when your best friend dies. I was shocked when reading that your parents can THAT insensitive to you. If you don’t have emotions to anyone, you would be classified as a socio/psychopath, with no emotion to anyone. Have your parents being abusive to you? If yes, please contact help. No it is never wrong to cry.  You can cry about anything, and it'll never be wrong. The death of someone   is nothing to be taken lightly. In fact, I'd be more surprised if someone didn't cry rather than if they did. You can cry whatever age, whatever time, whatever reason, and it's still okay to do so. As a parent of four, and a guy who has taught about grief recovery, I would be concerned about the mental state of any kid of mine who did NOT cry at the loss of a friend's life. BUT, I am not your parent. It might be enlightening to you to understand your parents' inability to sympathize or empathize with your loss. What conditions did they grow up in which make them adverse to grieving? Once you know that, you can pity them their inability to understand and move on...knowing that your displays of grief must be reserved for alone times, or with friends. In regards to Zelda, let me tell you I'm 61. There are onscreen deaths and other displays of reunification which still cause my tears to well up. Congratulations, you are human. Crying is a natural response when people are saddened by an emotionally powerful event. Losing a best friend is obviously both powerful (he’s dead and it’s irreversible) and emotional (if you didn’t have feelings for him then he wouldn’t be a friend). There’s nothing wrong with showing your emotions. It helps you cope with difficult situations. Holding it in makes stress worse, and too much stress is very unhealthy both mentally and physically. If your parents are trying to raise you to be a heartless psychopath, then by all means suppress any emotions, but otherwise, it’s very healthy to let your feelings out so you can deal with them. I’m very disappointed in parents who would chastise their son for showing emotion to the point where they call you names and threaten to lock you up. Are they physically abusive too or just emotionally abusive?
It depends on how you view it. Tell your student that, “An  atom  is the smallest unit of matter that has the properties of an  element . An  element  is a substance consisting of atoms which all have the same atomic number. So an element is bunch of atoms with same number of protons You can view it as an atom and an element. So “Sodium” is the name given to the atom that has 11 protons. If some matter is made of atoms that have 11 protons it is called Sodium. It is the element Sodium. If we took one atom out of that it is still called as Sodium because it has 11 protons. Or we can call it Sodium atom” If they dont know these words tell that “Sodium is an element. It is made of small more fundamental units called Sodium atoms” How do a sodium atom and a sodium ion differ? Why do we link atomic no. to no. of atoms (elements) as the atomic no. is for one atom? What is the atomic number of Na+ and He+? Why is the symbol of sodium Na? What is the atomic mass of an element equal to? Is H2O a molecule or a compound. H2O is a conpound which is made up of tiny molecules each of which is represented by H2O. Sodium . If you say the word sodium only, it will generally refer to an element. “Sodium is an element and this element is made up of small particles, the fundamantal of which is called a Sodium atom (Na) .” It is very interesting in case of metals. If all you wrote was “Na,” then it could be either, depending on whether you were talking about a single atom or a larger quantity. The context matters a lot in this case. Both….The symbol 'Na' (Latin:Natrium) represents one atom of the element sodium. Elemental sodium is a soft grey metal composed of sodium atoms? I usually take elemental to mean a reasonable amount of the same atom in a pure, vaguely stable form - more of a molecule I suppose. You can’t describe an atom of sodium as being metalic or silvery-grey or soft, those are propeties of the elemental form.
Sadly there aren’t any cricketers as of now that I’m aware of. But among Indians only @ Harsha Bhogle  is here on Quora, a wonderful commentator and a journalist. And of course there are heck a lot of fake accounts with the name of cricketers so even Quora is falling into such an inconvenience lately, yet policies are enough to uphold such things.

Recently I’ve started reading Quora. It works.
It depends on the faculty who is teaching. for NALSAR faculties make modules which consist of articles written by renowned authors, relevant excerpts from books, and case laws. apart from this, a standard text book is suggested for every subject. few faculties tend to keep the class updated and will send some articles to read for everyday class discussion. NCERT is mother of all the social science subject. It is recommended to read NCERT to have a basic idea of arts subject which one would be encountering in law school, especially for those coming from science background. Because once your arts subject commence in 1st year, there will be a presumption that you have read NCERT and have a basic idea about the discussion going on in class. This helps the faculty to shift the discussion to a higher pedestral. As far as your question is concerned, not everything will be there in NCERT but whatever you will be taught in 1st year, you can always relate it to your basic knowledge gained by NCERT. Which made-easy study material should I use? How do American high school students choose their subjects? How long do they study each subject? What are Honors and Advanced classes (any pre... How do I prepare for the AINS 22 certification? What all study materials will be useful? What is mathematics? Is every subject of study a kind of mathematics? Can I use resonance study material for class 11 exams as well? So first semester may be a bit shocker because along with books, knowledge shall be dispensed through lectures, research articles and lots of case laws. There will be subjects like constitution, torts, contracts, jurisprudence and legal methods. There are multiple books on these subjects which you can use as reference which are available in almost all law school libraries . So there won't be any scarcity of the same. But law is not merely about book knowledge but application of laws to situations so that might come as bit different because throughout school we are taught about reading and learning and not application of our learning. Law school will be completely different in that aspect.
Few key factors: 1. Belief:  You should be convinced that Mediation is not a fictional story and marketing gimmick, but an exercise which is in existence for centuries and have helped millions. If from the day one you think it is rubbish and has no value, then it won’t work. If you practice with this mindset, maybe after few days, you will leave it with enough complaints. 2. Teacher:  Find a teacher in initial days. Join some school to practice a particular technique. The way you enter a nursery school to learn alphabets, then in school you learn grammar, maths, science and with time you become independent. The same rule applies to Meditation. In the beginning, follow words of an experienced master. 3. Practice:  Practice it for a very long period. If possible practice it everyday, otherwise at least few days a week. You could start with 10 mins each day and then could reach to 1 hr, 3 hrs, 7 hrs, etc. It is up to you how much time you have, and how deep you would like to dive in. Don’t surrender quickly. The way you spend many years in school and college to become a doctor or a scientist, show similar dedication to learn this art. There is no short cut. It should become your daily routine the way you brush your teeth and take a shower, etc. 4. No miracle:  Please don’t expect any miracle while practicing. Things will happen naturally. The result will be in your behavior. You don’t have to set a goal while practicing this. Just do it without any goal. Few things in life should be performed without creating any goal. Just keep doing it. 5. Discipline:  Be discipline in life. It could be around your lifestyle, food habits, drinking, sleeping patterns, fitness, etc. It is important to live a disciplined life to be successful in this journey. After drinking 2 liters of beer or wine if you sit for meditation, it won’t give any result. It will only create a hallucination. What is the key to meditation? Is doing meditation for a long time bad? What is a key aspect of meditation that many practitioners are neglecting or missing? How does meditation help? Is it harmful to meditate for an hour? Three Main things are required——- Firm Determination Regularity No break, Continuity. You have determined to enter in Meditation, With ability to sit Still , relaxed, and with lot of Patience and Fearlessness. Meditation is an Event occuring itself naturally , cant be forced , so you must have a lovers patience to wait endlessly till event take place. When Event take place , have courage to go in the Depth because pearls are in depth. regularity is a must. As we clean our utensils daily so iys cleaning of inside. So enter in meditation fearlessly, with determination and Courage. Consistent practice. You just need to practice every day, even if it’s just a minute. However long you can sit for is fine, and if you practice every day, eventually that minute will stretch into two, three, fifteen, or an hour. This will “perhaps” be perfect for you. MEDITATE … CONTEMPLATE … RE-CREATE AND THEN … CELEBRATE … Your Own Answer and Many More Yet to Surprise You To No End. #1) Realize that all thoughts are conscious beliefs systems acting like trains attracting your “Attention” to get on board with their one track mind. #2) Visualize floating above the clouds where all belief thoughts are below the clouds. #3) Focus your Intentions Attention only on your breath for 10 minutes. If you find yourself back in that train car, float up again above the clouds and just smile. #4) And then if you can imagine the real you going into the infinite timeless zone of a pure black velvet space of warm soundless resonating love. Oh Ya … watch my below video that I am giving to the world hoping that someone … some day will be able to use this to discover their own unique and eternal Divinity. Love is For Always Geography Of The Mind Part III - Meditation, Contemplation, Re Creation & Celebration Have you ever wondered why, after more than 70,000 years … the human species has still failed to progress out of the colossal savagery of tribal starvation, human slavery, feminine bondage and war? Could it be the narrow limits, the impediments that our languages continues to bind us to, bind us like rusty iron belief chains linking us to our assessor's dilemma? :p>
There is no such special admission process for BSc in Physics Honours. You simply take up admission for BSc degree as physics as one of the subjects. After doing so, contact the professors in the Department of Physics for Honours Programme and they will guide you accordingly. I got 65.8 % in CBSE board. Can I get admission into St. Xavier college in Mumbai for BMM? Will I get admission in any DU College for BSc (Honours) Physics or Maths or Computer Science with 95%? If yes, then in which colleges? What was the cutoff for St. Xavier's Mumbai for its BSc IT course in 2016? When does its admission procedure start? My PCM Percentage is 90. I want to get admission in St. Xavier's College, Mumbai and pursue a BSc in geology. Do I stand a chance? My plus 2 percentage is 81 overall. I want to get admission in St. Xavier's College, Mumbai and pursue a BSc in geology. Do I stand a chance? Hi! Once the forms for this year’s admissions are out on the website, fill it up for Bsc. Choose your subjects wisely (you will have to study three papers for first two years and then in the third year on the basis of your marks and seat availability you’ll gt your desired subject). Your admission will be on the basis of your percentage (most importantly: CUT OFF) All the Best!
It depends on who is doing the surveillance. If it's just your dog watching you take a shower, what's the problem? Similarly, if it's an open source, decentralized machine learning algorithm that no one can corrupt or hack, then why not both? It might be called a form of crypto-anarchy, and it's better/faster/cheaper than the kind of complete surveillance you are implying. How do police track someone by their cell phone? How is a UAV used for surveillance? What is money in an anarchy? Zebronics 1KVA vs Zebronics 600 VA (ZEB 725) - Which one is better as a CCTV Surveillance back up (at least 2-3 hours)? Could the world fall back into anarchy? I am not sure that it is an “either/or” option. All surveillance is a delicate balance of human rights, privacy and effective law enforcement control. There is lots of evidence that the presence of CCTV does not even deter some crime - which is why many crimes ARE recorded on surveillance cameras, by stupid criminals who often act impulsively. Most people know that their internet and phone calls can be intercepted, but they still research and plan crimes using these communications mediums, and often get caught. In a well controlled democracy, I think surveillance has its definite place in order to maintain law and order - but there also need to be watchers, watching the watchers - to make sure abuses of the systems do not occur. Anarchy is better than complete surveillance, because complete freedom is always better than being under complete control by the state. I would rather have the compromise of a libertarian society (i.e. a small limited government and strong personal freedom).

You would likely be initially a junior member of a team at a pharmaceutical firm planning the marketing of new drugs being produced by biotechnology.

The combination of technology and finance is a powerful one and can certainly be put to use.
Because women and children were a drain on society’s resources. In civilizations with economies based on agriculture or industry, a strict division of labor along gender lines emerged. That's because men can't get pregnant and there was no such thing as baby formula, time-saving appliances, or fast food. Or birth control. Men left home to go to work in fields and factories, and came back home with the bacon. Women stayed home and nursed babies, cooked the food, and cleaned the house. In other words, women contributed nothing to the family’s economic coffers. On the contrary, they and their children were a drain on the family’s financial resources. What man in his right mind is going to be okay with spending his hard-earned money on children that aren’t his? Therefore, women’s sexuality needed to be strictly controlled. And by extension, so did men’s, though to a lesser degree. A man who impregnated a woman to whom he had not bound himself to support economically through marriage would be severely punished by the family of the impregnated woman, and by society at large. All of this is why there were (and still are) dowries. If a woman is useless economically, and in fact is a drain on resources, then a father has to bribe a man to take her off his hands. Women are still suffering the ramifications of these economic systems to this day. Cultural attitudes become deeply ingrained over millennia and can't be completely changed in a mere fifty years. By the way, all of this applies much less in hunter-gatherer societies, where the woman might provide as much as 80% of the family’s sustenance through her gathering activities. She just straps the baby on her back, goes out with the ther women, and collects the food and other resources in a few hours work. And because of her contributions, she is more highly valued in her society, and her sexuality is not nearly as restricted. Have you ever had sex with a complete stranger? What's your story? What is the minimum penis size needed to achieve penetrative sex? What does it feel like to receive oral sex? What are all the sex positions? How many times can a women have sex in one day? Why is sex so condemned although everyone is in constant need of it? Because religious rules were chosen to be almost unsatisfiable. That makes perfect sense from the perspective of a priest. If you want to keep your job, you need people in need of your help, in need of revelation. That means you need sinners but that is an easily solved problem if you can define yourself what is a sin. You simply define something people do by nature to be a sin and - voilà - there you created yourself an inextinguishable supply of sinners. If that still does not suffice, you simply invent something not the people have done but what their long lost ancestors have done, e.g. eating an apple they should not have eaten and therefore having been thrown out of paradise, and call it original sin. Even better, now everyone is a sinner by birth and what they do becomes irrelevant. Sin is nothing but a priests’ job security program. Sex as a sin is just a strategically valid choice for a sin. Not everyone is in constant need of it. There are asexual people, and there those who are unable to reflect on their desires and prefer to believe they just don’t need it. Besides, what is meant by “sex is condemned”? I would say what is condemned concerns: a) talking publically about one’s sex life as it is believed to be private b) having too much sex as it is believed to devalue you as a person c) sex an as act of violence d) non-traditional consensual sex (anything, depending on the personal opinion of what “non-traditional” is, which does not include c) ) This is all about sex, and many people are not sure where the borderline between the accepted and the unaccepted is. Even law regulations regarding these matters differ from country to country as they involve the role of sex in different cultures. Firstly, as c) exists, and sex can, indeed, be associated with violence and be seen as an act of taking control, this already makes people generalize and condemn sex as such. Secondly, like I said, there are cultural differences, and there are individual differences within one culture. This means there are social standards and expectations regarding this matter. The socio-cultural background has an immense effect on many people’s thinking, and they adjust their mindset to the most popular view in their environment. This makes them condemn anything outside these expectations. Thirdly, many people are incapable to evaluate the context. Sex is just sex. What makes it appropriate or inappropriate depends on the situation, in which it occurs, and the participants. Whether it is appropriate to talk about it also depends on the context. Something should be kept private, and something is okay to discuss, but how to know the difference? It is easier to condemn everything related to this. Finally, there is gender inequality (or, I’d rather say - differences) regarding what is accepted for women, and what - for men (like having many partners), and for the time being it is not likely to be changed. This causes a lot of tension as this view is constantly being challenged. There are a few reasons I can come up with. Sex is in general associated with so many problems, in relationships and mental and physical health, that many people would like to deprioritize it in their lives. Those who don’t share their viewpoints become obstacles to that reality. Attractiveness is hard to change and many people feel that we should judge others based on traits that they cannot change. One way to do that is by discouraging sex since it often centers on attractiveness. There are differences in the psychology of sex between genders and that’s led to some clashes between them. Many people actually experience a sense of disgust from the sexual practices of others, to the point that they take offense even simply knowing that they exist somewhere. Your premise is wrong. Everyone is not in constant need of sex. You will not die if you don’t have sex. Plenty of people lead sex-less lives by choice.
No: Serverless systems still require back-end developers. They simply lower the operational expenses of back-end infrastructure, while also providing different cost and deployment models. Someone still has to go and write the actual application logic, set up the build, package, test, and deployment systems, the logging, monitoring, alerting, and security systems, and so on. Serverless is simply a way of rethinking how people consume compute power - from a coarse-grained “here are some servers, you figure it out” model, to a “give me a function and I will run it for you on as many servers as it takes to handle your traffic” model.
When it became clear that most of republics (*) wanted to preserve the USSR  Soviet Union referendum 1991 , those who’d benefit from replacing the heavyweight superpower for small independent nations designed and implemented a very complex plot to break the Union. The  1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt  was only to top of the iceberg, and no one has yet definitely answered the question if the  State Committee on the State of Emergency  was in fact designed by Gorbachev to set up Yeltsin, by orthodox Communists to support Gorbachev against Yeltsin, or by Yeltsin’s covert supporters in order to discredit Gorbachev completely and immediately vest extraordinary powers to Yeltsin. Whatever it was stirred up protests and civil unrest both centrally and regionally. Nationalism, separatism and historic guilt were added as secret ingredients to the boiling mass. Violence erupted in Moscow, Leningrad, Samara, Sverdlovsk and other large cities in Russia, violent separatism rolled through Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Middle Asia. In this context, republics were considering secession “in order to prevent violence to spill over from Russia, torn by civil disobedience”, and Ukraine was the first to conduct her own plebiscite to counter the 4-month old results of the All-Union referendum of March 1991. Yet three months later (just after all republics had a chance to feel some radical violence, which the Soviet authorities failed to prevent or stop even in spite of occasionally using the army), Yeltsin called the leaders of Ukraine, Belorussia and Kazakhstan to Belovezha (close to the Polish border, so that there would be a handicap should the KGB come to arrest them as plotters) to sign the  Belavezha Accords . In fact, they gathered together in order to sign some minor economic documents, but the meeting ended up big. In spite of the absence of the leader of Kazakhstan, who went to Gorbachev instead (so, Gorbachev was aware of the plot but chose not to retreat to repressive action), the accords were signed. The first person the three men called to tell the news was George Bush. With his support and approval, they made the second telephone call, this time to Gorbachev. In spite of the will of the people in 10 republics, the troika dissolved the government of the USSR (as the president of Russia, Yeltsin simply shut down all USSR offices in Moscow). The USSR stopped to exist, and other republics soon had no choice but to join the Accords. Why were the results of the 1991 referendum ignored? It was because a bunch of people, raised and bred within the communist system, had no respect the will of their people. They switched alliances to serve the interests of foreign powers, and used their insight to kick the people in their very soft groin. (*) Excluding the Baltics, which had already been stirred up to the extent of rebellion by the publication and heated discussion of the fake “secret protocol” to the Pact of Molotov-Ribbentrop, Georgia and Armenia, where local nationalists promoted immediate secession. The five republics effectively claimed their sovereignty even before the 1991 referendum, that is, before asking the people.
Here is a step-by-step guide to add social media buttons to blogger. In your Blogger Dashboard click on “Template” in the left menu. (If you’re using the old interface, you will need to click “Design” instead.) Click the “Edit HTML” button. In the window that appears, click the “Proceed” button. In the window that appears, check the “Expand Widget Templates” checkbox at the top. In the HTML code, find the first instance of this line of code:  <data:post.body/>   (Note: This line of code appears multiple times throughout your template. The number of times this appears varies depending on your template. Lately most of the templates I’ve worked on required that I find the  SECOND instance  of it.) Paste the  following  code  ABOVE  that line of code. <!-- Scripts Start -->

I assume you are talking about the time prior to WWI when the Balkans were wresting their independence from a decaying Ottoman Empire. There is no record of several million Muslims being killed. However, there are recordings of wars, starting in the 1870’s, that were fought between Ottoman troops and various Balkan and Russian troops, resulting in death and destruction on both sides.  There was no campaign of systematic extermination but many Muslims fled Balkan states rather than undergo what would be turn-about discriminatory rule. This was certainly not a case of genocide. Why does Islam respect the number 786? Christianity: What is it like to be a Christian in a Muslim country? Why are non Muslim minorities persecuted in Pakistan? Were Muslims ever persecuted under Hindu rulers? Why do non-Muslims consider Muslims to be terrorists? Unfortunately because they were weak cuz easily powerful people don't get killed. Powerful people are always right and receives millions of justifications to not be wrong The world has been and will always be using double standards Ethnic cleansing by Serbia against its Muslim Bosnian population in the 1990s is considered genocide. Mladic, Milosevic and Karadzic were charged with it at the Hague; only Karadzic survived to be convicted. But he was convicted.
If the added lane is part of a junction, it will be noted by a sign like this: You  always  need to check for traffic that will be merging into the roadway before getting into the other lane when there is this configuration. If the lane is being added  without  a merge (for example the ‘auxiliary’ lanes in this diagram), theoretically it shouldn’t be necessary as people shouldn’t be outside the fog lines. But the check is still not a bad idea if the traffic is heavy. Especially on heavily congested roads, it’s not at all uncommon to see an aggressive driver either jump the gun on getting into the new lane or at the least get into it right away and speed up to pass without waiting for the traffic to settle, thus creating a hazard for other motorists seeking to merge into it. Better safe than sorry, even though the resultant accident would  probably  be ruled the fault of the lane jumper. (That much said, I am usually constantly watching my rear-view mirror for this type of assholes and so I’m generally aware of how likely the above possibility is. If there’s not much traffic about or the traffic is well-behaved, I usually can skip the extra head movement. If you’re doing a road test for a driver’s licence, don’t skip it though—it certainly never  hurts .) (Images from the Federal Highway Administration.) All of my stress goes to my left upper shoulder and it's always sore. It's actually visibly bigger than my right shoulder. How can I fix this?... How do I stop a glitch on my left shoulder? Since I have started working out, my shoulders are not level anymore. My right shoulder is lower compared to my left. How do I correct this? Can I go straight through a left turn lane? Do you have to turn left into the left lane? There are so many things that you need to be aware of when changing lanes, even if it's a new designated lane. My driving habits are to communicate with signaling, checking by looking in the driver, passenger, rear view, and driver again before a final head turn before slowly transitioning to a new lane. You can never know when someone else may decide to move to a lane without doing any of the above, so it's up to you to be aware of your own safety. Based on other questions, I understand that “shoulder check” is a problem. People who are not taking an actual road test may not always do a full, over-the-shoulder check of a lane that has newly opened up, when a road goes from two lanes to three. People who have DMV Agents in the car with them during a road test would do well to make some body motion that suggests an over-the-shoulder look has been made, or perhaps, discuss physical limitations with the Test Agent before the road test. People with all sorts of limitations get licenses. There are work-arounds for most things. Other drivers do the damnedest things. I heard of someone killed because he pulled out to pass three cars at one go, and the car at the top of the line turned left. I can see someone pulling into the shoulder to pass you on the left, knowing there was a new lane coming up, and then you hitting them thinking there couldn’t possibly be anyone in that lane because it just opened up. You might be in the clear, but they would be dead. The main thing you need to remember while driving, especially on multi-lane highways, is that no matter how good of a driver you are, you have to assume that every other driver on the road is an idiot. Because sooner or later, that will be proven true. So ANY TIME that you go past a junction, you need to assume that someone will pull into your lane, without looking, and unless you are fully aware of your surroundings, you will be involved in an accident. The short answer is - I do. You never know what clown might be in a bigger hurry than you and try to zip around. And he could be hiding in your blind spot when you check the mirror. Even when it’s not necessary, i.e., the above isn’t even possible, I still do because it’s a good habit. Always better to be safe, than sorry.

Our second civilization was Barbaric. We still have them…look at Middle East and not so good life basically everywhere. And hence horrified too…That is part of Reincarnation. The catch is…once you know them, life gets better. But people do not accept it and hence, we have problems even today everywhere. My understanding is that, in the past…like 12,000 years ago, Indians and American Indians ( Natives) were in an Agrarian Society. Hence a little better. Chinese were too to a certain extent for later the situation worsened (200 BC). So, know your reincarnation and be good…today on to the future and be a part of the Universal High Civilization. How do you know that you've had a past life? Have your children ever done something that made you think they might've had a past life? What do you think you were in a past life and why? How do we know who we were in our past life? Can one know what he or she was in past life? Horrified. But I cannot “unring the bell”. One must learn absolute acceptance - the knowledge makes way for resolutions in the future. Peace and blessings.

a differential equation represent infinite number of curve until you don't have x and y coordinates which could represent only one line for ex:- assume curve y^2=4x+9 and (0,3) satisfy this equation create a differential equation dy/dx-2/y=0 now solve it y^2=4x+C where C is constant and this equation represent infinite curve until you don't have value of C which give you particular solution now satisfy the points and you will get particular solution, C=9 How do I solve  [math]\dfrac{dy}{dx}=x^2+y^2[/math] What is the solution of the Differential equation (dy/dx)-a=0? What does it mean when the solution of partial differential equation is a complex number? What does it mean to have the force as a complex num... What is the solution to this differential equation? 1/ (3√y5)? Why do solutions of differential equations have to occur over an interval? What does it mean? It has many general solutions but only one particular solution.
First it was Aryavart, where the Veda [1]  s were composed and there was no religion but Dharma (righteousness). When the most Civilizations were fighting viking wars. This part of the world was doing all kind of experiments from monarchy to democracy. Bhaarat was, what the country really was, established by Bharat the King. All its history till Ashoka and All the Jaychands. In such Bhaarat :- Religions were flourishing. Even evolving. No religious clashes were there. India was source for religion for rest of the known world, be it China, Japan, Indonesia, Cambodia etc. Then it became Hindostaan [2]  . Hindostaan lived a short life. where:- Its art really emerged. Amalgamation of culture happened what founded the Now diverse India. Samosa, Kachori, Biriyani, Qualeen, shaawls and sherwanis are the remnants of this era. And then it became India , As British, Dutch and Portuguese saw it. right beyond Indus. its the modern day India [3]  . Above were my views, Go for footnotes. It describes better. Thanks For Reading. Jai Hind. Footnotes [1]  Vedic period - Wikipedia [2]  Hindustan - Wikipedia [3]  India - Wikipedia What is difference between India and Bharat as names? What is the difference between India and the United States of America? What are the differences in India between 90s kids and today's kids? What is the difference between India and Russia? What is the difference between Nepal and India? Two of the words we often use for our country are India and Bharat. The word India comes from the Indus, called Sindhu in Sanskrit.  The Iranians and the Greeks who came through the northwest about 2500 years ago and were familiar with the Indus, called it the Hindos or the Indos, and the land to the east of the river was called India. The name Bharata was used for a group of people who lived in the northwest, and who are mentioned in the Rigveda, the earliest composition in Sanskrit (dated to about3500 years ago). Later it was used for the country. Article 1 of Indian Constitution states that, India i.e Bharat shall be a Union of states. Both are names of India. Western people couldn't pronounce “s” properly, so they pronounced “Sindhu River” as “Indus River”. Land beyond Indus was called India and people of India were Indians. Legends say, that name  Bhārat (भारत)  came from emperor  Bharat (भरत). Bharat (भारत) : Generally Bhaarat means “Descendants of Emperor Bharata”. Bharat (भरत) was an anceint emperor who unified India. He was son of King Dushyant and Shakuntala. He was direct ancestor of legendary Kauravas and Pandavas of Mahabharata. So the term “Bhaarat” is derived from Bharat and it tries to mean that it's the land of Scions of Bharat. You can call yourself “Bhaarat”. So “Bhaarat” can be a term for both “India” and “Indians”. India : This term got it's name after Indus River. It generally means “The Land of Indus”. Both are constitutional names of India in Hindi and English.
Yes and no. In most context they pretty much mean the same thing and are totally in interchangeable. I think in most cases the only reason why you would choose one over another is differences in dialect and one may sound more natural than the other. Although “不要臉” is generally the one people go for. But I would say that, in certain circumstances, choosing one over another can imply different things. Whereas “dont want face” often is used to talk about something that's  beinf  done, and you would say “dont want face” when someone is  doing  certain thing as a warning, urging them to think about the possible social ostracism that could result. Whereas “cannot see people” implies (again, only in certain contexts) that that you've  already  committed a faux pas and that's why you “cannot bear to see people”. Also is that “dont want face” is often used as a criticism, when you want to criticise someone for commuting a faux pas or when someone is doing something inappropriate  and  being overconfident about it. With “dont want face" there's also more of a connection to one individual, whereas “cannot see people” is more often used to describe something that has shamed an entire family. There's a saying in Chinese that “家醜不外揚”, which literally means “dont spread the family’s shame” because in traditional Chinese society, one person’s wrong doing could easily shame an entire family and ruin the family's reputation. And “cannot see people” often imply something that has shamed an entire family. There was one other thing I wanted to write but I forgot. So just going to leave it at that. Why is it that a lot of Chinese people don't feel oppressed by their regime but some foreigners insist they are? Why does it seem like Chinese people don't want to speak Chinese to me? Why don't Chinese people revolt against communist rule and bring about democracy in China? Why do so many people in Taiwan and Hong Kong like to say that China is bad, yet they cannot see the great changes in China? Do the Chinese people still want Taiwan to be part of China, even after they discovered that the Taiwanese people don't want to be a part of C... 「见不得人」means shady, that is to say smth is the skeleton in the closet, and it actually means “cannot be seen by people”. Whereas 「不要脸」 is similar to being a “sob” or the b-word, in a sense. It is used to refer to someone that does not seem to care for his/her reputation. The former (cannot see people) is generally neutral; however the latter (don’t want face) is negative and could be seen as a taboo word in China. 不要脸is a bad word, saying someone is shameless. 你这个不要脸的混蛋！You shameless bastard. 见不得人has several meanings, sometimes it's a way to show humility, -听说你学钢琴已经有三年了。I heard that you have been learning piano for three years. -学艺不精，见不得人。I'm not good at it, it cannot show in front of others. 见不得人could also mean unable to see others. 她生病了，见不得人。She is sick, unable to see other people. actually, there are much difference between the two phrases. when you do something bad and don't want others konw, you can say :见不得人 不要脸is a dirty word, when others do something bad, you can say it to him. 不要脸 Don’t want face means shameless or a person who do shameful things without any concern of shame 见不得人 cannot see people means too shame to let people know So it’s like most shameless v.s. most shameful
No offense, but it’s neither one. Actually none of the countries in South-Asia can represent any of these aspects. Through the Islamic history, if you inspect closely, every prophets and messenger represents the pillars. They made Islam stand on what it is today, not the region where they spread their words. And if you consider the backbone of Islam, all the faith of Muslims are held on the Ka’aba of Mecca. All the Muslims have their faith stood tall around it. (May Allah forbid) If it falls, so would the faith of billions of Muslims. And if your question is based on the size of Muslim population based on a country or region, even there Pakistan fails to qualify as both pillar or backbone since Indonesia is at the top on Muslim majority population. Also, don’t forget that Islam wasn’t spread in the Indian sub-continent in a large scale until the Mughals invaded. What do the five pillars of Islam do for Allah? Is it a crime to be an atheist in Islamic countries like Pakistan? Will Pakistan be able to payback the loan of CPEC? What are the Five Pillar of the Islam? Is the Constitution of Pakistan Islamic? Why do they need a constitution? Why does the TTP attack Pakistan? Pakistan is not regarded as a pillar or backbone of Islam, but fortress of Islam as it is the first Islamic state in the world which is established in the name of Islam after the state of Medina. If you exclude Islam from Pakistan, there is no reason for it to be a separate country. We Pakistanis whether from any region or ethnic denomination, love Islam from the core of our hearts despite most of us are not practicing Muslims. Islam is the binding force in Pakistan and there is no compromise on it. As a nation, we may have differences of opinion, political polarization and sense of deprivation for one reason or the other, but when it comes to Islam we are one. Those who are the champions of human rights and champions of freedom of religion want every right for them, but there is no room in their hearts for the individuals who want to follow Islam. Thai proverb “ If you want to know Buddha, go to Pakistan. Iran, Kashmir, Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan was the heartland of Buddhism for thousands of Years. Buddhist appears in the Koran as Sabians, Mandeans or Subba. Buddhism originated in these regions not India.

Depends, if you are going for internship than definitely yes. But I assume you are going for foundation program since in internship program date of joining decided by your collage. In my batch we all got same joining date since we are first batch of that financial year. But some of my friends joined with different joinig date but they are from different branches so you can't be sure but 70% to 80% you will be on same batch. Should I go to the same college as my ex? Is Infosys training and the Infosys 8th sem. internship the same? What was it like to be with Emma Watson at Brown? Are BCA training and BTech training the same at Infosys? What kind of service can I provide to college students? Yes it will provide you same batch if you have same joining date.

You can’t talk about native ethnicities in Spain. Like the rest of Europeans, we are a mix of: 1) black skinned hunter-gatherers, who were the first to arrive 2) A wave of farmers from the middle east that brought their crops and livestock, starting around 10k years ago. 3) Bronze age horse riders from the steppes (present day Russia and Ukraine). They were males that left their women at home and brought metallurgic knowledge, chariots and horses. They came around 4,5k years ago, and must have enjoyed a tremendous success amoung the local ladies, as their contribution to our DNA is the highest of the three groups. So what happened to celts and iberians, who blended and gave way to celtiberians? The celts correspond approximately with the descendants of the third group. Their concentration is higher in the northern regions of Spain. The iberians were a mix of the first two groups, that had been living and breeding together for millenia before the arrival of the celts. If you add smaller amounts of blood from Phoenicians, Romans, Visigoths, Arabs and a few others, you will get the core composition of a present day spaniard. Is the white race going to go extinct? Are the majority of Filipinos multiracial? How many days should I spend in Ibiza Spain? Why are many Mozart operas set in Spain? How many people of the Costa del Sol can speak English (Spain)? I don’t have much specific knowledge. As far as I am aware the DNA profile is pretty much the same mish mash of ethnicities you find anywhere else in Western Europe But Europeans don’t much care. Ethnicity is not even remotely interesting to Europeans and the American obsession with it is regarded with at best bemused amusement Europe is full of differing and mixed cultural influences that make the place fascinating. That interests Europeans far more
Strength, mostly. Leaving out the math and assuming you are asking about the wavy outer profile and not something constructed like cardboard: Corrugated plastic can be manufactured thick enough to be strong enough for many applications, but it will not stand under heavy loads, such as regular traffic. We use it as detention chambers for storm water and generally bury it 2 or more feet deep, filling around with specific combinations of gravel and sand to help maintain its shape. It is not strong enough for traffic to go over it, so it’s generally put in places there will be no regular traffic driving around, like back yards or roadside swales or other “open” spaces. See  Stormtech  for more info. Corrugated steel pipe is generally used for culverts under roads and driveways where each end is open, for instance, to let a ditch flow under a driveway. They can be quite large and are sometimes installed in pairs or groups if a road or driveway needs to be built over a large ditch or creek. They need a certain amount of dirt over the top to protect them because they can collapse if too much weight is put on them. Concrete pipes are used the same as corrugated steel if there isn’t enough cover over the pipe or the ditch is shallow. Concrete is also used under roads for “regular” storm water removal as part of a system that may be made up of all concrete or a combination of concrete and other materials (ductile iron, steel and various types of PVC) and may have fittings (wyes, tees, bends, etc.) and/or connect to various structures such as catch basins and manholes. Concrete is sometimes used for sewer pipes, although most new residential and small commercial is generally PVC these days…
Of course there is :- UES - UNIVERSITY ENTRY SCHEME- Indian army takes young engineers in final year/ after passout, after interview followed by SSB. CDS-COMBINED DEFENCE SERVICES - UPSC conducts exam for graduates for defence services here also civil engineers can apply. All the best.
You cannot like ‘pages’ but you can follow them, which you can find out by checking your ‘following’. However, if you have liked the ‘posts’ on which quotes were there, you can find them by going to your liked photos. Here’s how: instagram> settings> account> posts that you’ve liked> and voila! You might have to scroll past a few photos if it’s not a post you have like recently. I really wish this helps.
I was deliriously in love and had been proposed to by my boyfriend. Still, something held me back from having sex. I had always been concerned about being used for sex, then “discarded.” It was almost irrational at that point, but I was waiting for the ring, I guess. The ring never came. Our future was not to be. He took up with another woman he met through work and that was that. About two weeks later I dried my eyes, pulled myself together, and placed myself in proximity to his best friend, letting nature (and my planning) take It's course. Within a month, on Halloween of all days, I chose him to sleep with, just to get the whole virginity thing out of the way. He was very sweet, but it was nothing special. It could have been worse, right? We went on to date for several months and he professed his love. I liked him very, very much, but my heart just wasn't in for much else. What does it feel like when you lose someone you loved so much? Should I tell someone why I love them if they don't love me? What do you do if someone says I love you but you don't love them? What should you do if you don't want to lose someone you love very truly? I don't love my parents anymore. Can I ever come out of this feeling? I did not really love my first sexual partner, although she was delightful in many ways. I had a wonderful time with her, and have the warmest imaginable feelings about her 47 years later.
Most of those companies do a lot of software development and rely heavily on an Agile development approach for software and are able to blend together the right level of traditional project and program management with an Agile software development approach to fit the situation. Relying only on a traditional plan-driven approach to project management doesn’t typically work in that kind of environment because the approach needs to be much more flexible and adaptive. In that kind of environment, creativity and rapid innovation are typically more important than planning and control to achieve conformance to a plan.

Like its other 7 siblings, Assam is very backward. Although it has strategic and resources advantage, the corruption and lethargy are to be blamed. The North East fares soo well in the HDI and literacy but fails to turn it to development and growth. According to a study, at least 40% of the government projects are channelled to the corrupt officials. The North East is poorly connected by road, air and even digitally. The quality of education is poor. It is mainly bookish and not practical. The bureaucrats feel isolated and their enthusiasm waters down after few futile attempts and resort to corruption.. Being less populous the states have very less representation in the Parliament and so mostly they are unheard. Even though they get assistance from the center, most of it is diverted or misutilized. They are wholly integrated with India as there exist some resistance in the minds of some Indian. The resource tapping is hindered by the forest policies or people. The migration from the neighbourhood is also a major demographic problem. The unrest and unresolved territorial claims are a concern. Last but not the least, the standard time is also causing delays. The daylight saving is impossible as India wholly follows IST which is about one hour different from the mainland. Thus North East is backward and not connected digitally. The change has to come from the people. The proper leadership and inclusive development and citizen participation and peaceful arbitration of the issues will give very much appreciated returns sooner than later. So instead of blaming, people have the opportunity to be the change. All the best. Why is Odisha a backward state? Who is the richest man in Assam? What kept Pakistan from developing at the same pace as India? What is capital of Assam? Which city do you think is still backwards in India, and why? Depends on what your definition of backwardness is. If lacking a govt. email ID - or let me use a broader term - a fully functional e-governance system - is a sign of backwardness, then most govt. offices and staff all over India are backward, not only Assam. When it comes to infrastructure - road, train, air, or other such amenities that depends on central govt grant, Assam and the other N-E states used to be “neglected” by mainstream India and central govt in spite of being a huge source of revenue from petroleum, tea and many other natural resources, although now it is changing. Otherwise, if we consider education, social system, women empowerment, communal harmony, tolerance, fashion, literature, art, culture etc, most of the N-E states are way more advanced than many other Indian states or nations and in certain areas they can serve as role models for them. For example, concepts like dowry, honor killing rampant in all over India are foreign to the North-East states in India - beat that. Asaam is so backward? A paper work getting delayed, not using letterhead and not having a valid email id seems very strong reasons to tell it a backward state. Now let me give you some glimpse of our backwardness. The gateway to North-EAST starts from the same backward state. Even today we don't take dowry and rated in the list of one the most safest and respectful place for girls in the entire India. In spite of having the greatest diversities in the enthic origin of the people, we still strive to stay in harmony and peace. People ditch their homeland after using the same scholarship benefits given to them by the state government. They even try to belittle their homeland still people like Jadev Payeng, Papon are striving hard to make the state proud. Assam host the first place in the entire Asia to have discovered oil and use the cable run drilling technology. There isn't any state in the country where the lack of proper facilities is not a problem. It's not the fault of the State, It's the fault of people like us who don't know how to use the complains nd suggestions box in the office or talk to the higher authority to resolve the issue. I AM A PROUD ASSAMESE GUY. I HAVE DONE MY BITS OF TEACHING MY YOUNGER GENERATION TO SHOW SOME RESPECT TO THEIR HOMELAND. HAVE YOU? Assam is backward because of the political leaders of India who never gave any importance to the area as they thought it a region of tribal. British came to Bengal in 1757, developed Bengal keeping the region as Bongo-Bihar-Orissa. Education and culture came to Bengal and other regions but not to the Eastern regions of India (Undivided Assam). It was under Burmese army. It was Maniram Dewan of Assam, who took the help of British to get rid off of Burmese and developed the Tea garden. At the beginning of British administration it was under the command of Bengalis, who neglected the area and later after 1947, it was neglected by the Delhi Government, rather divided Assam into several states destroyed the unity and the economy. Otherwise it was a gate way to the East towards South East Asia as Bombay is the gateway to the West.

I was a science student till 12 and now I am pursuing B.A. from University of Delhi. Can I ever get a chance to join Indian Air Force? I'm a 12th passed non medical student and I want to join the Indian Air Force or Indian Navy as a pilot. What should I do? I am a student related to science with PCB, and I have recently passed my 12th class. How I can join the Indian Air Force Can a B.tech biotech student get into the Indian Air Force? If so, how and what are the branches open for them? Yes. Engineering graduates get paid more. Because the positions you can apply for after your schooling all have a lower pay band than the positions you can apply after your B’Tech degree. However, if you join the NDA after your 12th, and become an Air Force officer through the National Defense Academy, then you will be paid the same as the graduates as you too will have an engineering degree by the time you pass out of the academy. But you’re just gonna apply after 12th to be an airman, then you won’t be paid much. All the other graduates will be paid more as they are officers.

Nvidia can downsample your higher resolution video to get a crisper less aliased picture. Check if you have your drivers installed. If you are running on 4K or multi-monitor resolutions, this FPS is to be expected, so there is no issue. SSAA can be very intensive so maybe turn that off if Overwatch has it. :) Why am I getting such low FPS? Can my PC run GTA V on low at 30 fps? Is using a GTX 1070 for 1080p 60 Hz gaming overkill? How much FPS would this laptop get on most games at 1080p? Is a GTX 1070 enough for 4k gaming? Assuming your playing at 1080p here, sounds like a power limit or thermal limit is being hit. 70fps on ultra is not normal for that card. I have dual x5650s and a  20%   underclocked  RX 470 4GB and i get 60fps on ultra. 1.Download HWinfo or HWmonitor to monitor temps in game. Depending on your Geforce settings you may have a limit of 70–80. 76 is the average under load). 2. Assuming your running at least a 650watt power supply up the power limit by 20%(MSI afterburner might work better than Geforce software) 3. Watch temps again and adjust until you find a power/heat/fps compromise that you and your pc can handle. https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwat... Launch overwatch directly and not through Battlenet. That seems to be a cpu hog. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/... Also Geforce experience seems to like overriding graphics settings. Try to disable or uninstall it. You need to overclock your processor. That would allow for your processor to work more efficiently for task like Winston’s primal rage xd. Your processor would be able to preform better, overclocking is like “unlocking” the full potential of your CPU
Talent . Businesses depend on high-quality talent to create invention and innovation. Businesses need radical thinking which disrupts pre-existing patterns and prevents stagnation. Businesses need management which should be forever hungry, and never complacent or satisfied. Inequality results in recruitment from a narrow pool of candidates. They hire individuals from privileged backgrouns, who think and act like the generation before. Instead of finding the very best person to do the job, they end up with faces who best fit the frame on the golf-club wall. That sort of conservatism results in stagnant complacent decision making and a yes-man culture. Modern business needs to be punk rock, not easy listening. Inquality deprives business of the talent it needs. Is income inequality really increasing? Why is inequality a problem? Why is inequality more of a problem now more than ever? What is the real problem, poverty or inequality? Why is income inequality such a huge problem in the U.S.? And what can be done to fix this problem? The question should start with: “what is the main mission of a business?” Or even, what is the most important output of our work ? I think de facto for many people it is money, otherwise there wouldn’t be so many moaning bored employees who don’t really care for their work. Why do we need money? Because it is the proxy for security and health, however misguided it might be. Society where money is deemed the best gift to the future generations, guarantor of health, opportunities and security - in my view, is doomed to forever compete in the rat race for scrums. In this system a poorly educated mass that consumes is convenient for a lot of businesses. But is this the system we would like our children to live in? I’d rather my children be inspired by their peers, than compete on whose dad has the largest…. 4x4, for example. Never ask “why” before asking “if”. At most, inequality is a problem for some businesses that are selling goods and services between the categories of “commodity” and “luxury”. If there were more people who were perhaps “solidly middle class”, they could afford the product offered by that business at the current competitive price. Remember, though, that a competitive price is not just a low price that beats out other people in the market you serve, but one sufficiently high that it makes your profit margins appetizing enough for shareholders who invest in your industry.
No, India is not the greatest country in the world. We are 2nd in population, 131st in Human Development, 168th in literacy, 134th in Global Youth development, 41st in Competitiveness, 66th in Quality of life, 123rd in Economic Freedom, 122 in per capita GDP, 66th in global innovation, 122nd in Happiness and Number One in the world for searching - “ How to get a visa for USA ” India is not even a moderately great country today, and there is no chance for us to be great in the future as well. We Indians are a bunch of morally corrupt, self centered hypocrites who just can’t stop treating our nation as a large dust bin and our glorious monuments as an eternal facebook wall, liking the rule of law only if it gets applied on ‘others’ and secretly dreaming of a day when we ‘settle’ abroad and make babies which complain about our spicy food and dirty water in cute accents. Yes we had the great  Indus Valley Civilisation  that had broad roads and insanely great drainage but today, 569 Million of us defecate in the open everyday - 63 million [1] do not have access to even drinking water and over 240 million [2] among us have just no idea how it feels to sit under an electric fan. Yes, we have the world’s largest democracy and a really awesome constitution but, 70 years since we got charge of things in our own hands - 50% of all our children enrolled in a school, never pass [3] class V. 8 out of 10 residents of our districts like Jhabua , [4]  which is roughly 240 kms from IIM-A, can’t even scribble their own names to claim a government grant. Yes, we’ve sent probes on the Moon and Mars, and have sent about 30% [5] of the Current and recent  Global Fortune 500  CEOs from our colleges - but 95% [6] of the software engineers graduating from the same colleges today, cannot even write a code. 24 [7] Indian students commit suicide every day - that’s about 1 every hour - 1 student - every hour! We are a pissing, spitting, lying, backstabbing, jealous, depraved, egoistic, envious, vengeful, petty, undereducated, scantily read, chest thumping, arrogant, ungrateful, insecure, overly emotional, short cut seeking, greedy, cocky, discriminative, self contradicting, unrespectful, biased, blind and hypocritical society that loves watching trailer reactions of Baahubali 2, made by foreigners and Pakistani news shows talking about how screwed up they are in comparison to India. But it wasn’t like this all the time. We too were a bunch of inquisitive minds. Out of 46 ancient civilisations tabulated by UNESCO - 45 are dead - we are the only ones who still survive. We are the same people who wrote amazing poems, designed awesome ships, invented the cutting edge in technology, weaved the finest in fashion, taught the world to measure the universe, count and have sex [8] . We had schools of philosophy, the world wanted to send their kids to, we had people who conquered empires and nations armed with just their ideologies. We contributed the same (25–27% [9] ) to the world economy as the whole of Europe today, and produced breathtaking stuff that the world was crazy about - so crazy that they tried for centuries to find a sea route to India and named the Native Americans after us. We were the original land of opportunities. The original destination of refuge for the hunted and the oppressed. The only land where the non-conformers, the dissenters weren’t killed and arguments ( shastrarth ) were a way of life. Our best Poet, Kalidasa, was the son of wood cutters. Kabirdas was born to an unwed mother, Maharshi Valmiki, the author of Ramayana, was born into a dalit household, Ved Vyasa, the author of Mahabharata was born to a family of fishermen. Our Rishi of Rishis, Vishwa Mitra, wasn’t even a Brahman - and most of us don’t know this, because it didn’t matter. Zero brahmins protested in front of King Bharat of Ayodhya, when his elder brother and Kshatriya Prince, killed a celebrated member of their clan, born in greater NOIDA [10] . There was a time when the tallest people in our society were those who had knowledge and those who gave up their worldly possessions. We equated a king who faced defeat, Maharana Pratap to the same pedestal as Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, a victor - just because Pratap gave up everything for his principles and never stopped trying. But today, we are a different bunch of people. We hate those who have a different opinion, ethnicity, caste, religion or color. We today are even ready to kill those who do not confirm or those who voted for someone we don’t like. We aren’t ready today to let our kids become anything other than doctors and engineers. We protest against the corrupt - primarily because we are jealous of them. We have a unique sense of superiority which only wakes up when a foreigner calls us poor , [11]  or a tennis star fails to recognise [12] one of our sporting stars. We never sat up and took notice when a fellow Indian was forced to carry his dead wife for 12 [13] kilometers on foot, because the administration in his village had no ambulance. Today, money is the only relevant scale of achievement in our society. Even the talented among us aren’t respected until they either amass money or get awards from abroad. Our hearts have reduced in size, we aren’t welcoming anymore, we have completely stopped caring about our environment, building upon the knowledge of our forefathers, trying to solve the mysteries of the universe, building amazing things, that the world loves. We have even stopped looking up at the skies at night. The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. We Indians, have decidedly stopped being awesome and great. The question is, can we do better? Thanks for reading. Cheers and peace.

India is not the greatest yet, but it’s on its way.  These are the different categories on the basis of which we can compare India to other countries. In terms of military power  With strength of over 1.4 million active personnel, it is world's 3rd largest military force and has the world's largest volunteer army. Indian Armed Forces - Wikipedia In terms of religion diversity Largest  Hindu  population. Largest  Sikh  population. Largest  Zoroastrian  population. Largest  Bahá'í Faith  in the world. Largest  Jain  population. 9th Largest  Buddhist  population. 2nd Largest  Muslim  population. In terms of politics According to the 2010 CPI, India has a score of 3.3. That indicates a comparatively high level of corruption, as expected. But among countries in the neighbourhood, China has a score of 3.5, Pakistan 2.3, Bangladesh 2.4, Nepal 2.2 and Sri Lanka 3.2. Afghanistan and Myanmar are at a very low 1.4. The recent outbreak of scams would undoubtedly have worsened perceptions about corruption in India and our score will probably be worse if a survey is conducted right now. How corrupt is India compared with other countries? In terms of population India is projected to overtake China as the world's most populous nation by 2030. In terms of linguistics According to  Census of India of 2001 , India has 122 major languages and 1599 other languages. However, figures from other sources vary, primarily due to differences in definition of the terms "language" and "dialect". India is second on the list of english speaking countries, with 125 million English speakers. But only 226, 449 of those speak it as a first language. For the rest, it’s a second language. Whatever the rank, I’m proud to be an Indian. alis grave nil Hope to see you again! Aditi Goyal Nope ! We are far from great. In fact let me go one step further and say that we are dirt poor.  Yes , I said it ! Don’t believe me , let me list down some points. We rank  124  in Literacy ( out of 160 countries for which data is available) 141  in Global peace index Sure our GDP is soaring and growth rate is one of the highest in the world, but we are so many people and when we look at GDP per capita , it is $6,700 , which ranks  159. This is an excerpt from PwC report , The World by 2050. “Though PwC expects India to make significant strides in converging the gap with rich nations like the United States and Japan, Indians won’t fully catch up with their American counterparts. In 2050, Indian GDP per capita would still be less than one third of that of the average American. There is a long way to go before Indian living standards rise to the levels of the world’s most prosperous countries but, despite  short-term challenges  like rising oil prices and demonetization, optimism for the long-term is warranted. ” We rank  97  in Global Hunger Index ( out of 118 countries for which data is available ) Human Development Index -  131 World Prosperity Index -  104 Access to electricity -  137 .  Approximately 20% of people from India do not have access to electricity The list goes on ! So how can we be great , or even close! We still have to make our citizens aware why they should not defecate in open. And we are racist, even thought we are not white !  We are highly ignorant, and get offended even for smallest things. We rank 4th in slavery, and hilariously it is our own people who we enslave.   We have poor roads, poor hygiene, poor healthcare !  Our children our malnourished, uneducated and pushed to work at a young age. Heath care is a joke. What is affordable is of poor quality. We have no control as of now on population growth and the demographic benefit that we have over China , I am not too sure we will take much benefit of it. Our biggest resource , i.e.  Human resource is very poorly skilled. And all of these problems are not going to disappear, not anytime soon. But , I do not have much problem with this as much as I do have with how people behave in this country.  All we do is be proud of our past. Countless movies have stupid conversations of how India is land where the idea of  zero  originated, of Indus Valley civilization , the golden age of India ; of how we built temples cut out of mountains, roads that connected mountain to the sea, our great art and culture. All the chest thumping! Some one  may  have said that India is poor country , and we got offended.  And the best we could manage is give them a poor review, so helpful. Indians in our imagination live in high rising towers in Metro cities, posting happy and merry pictures on Instagram. Well we are poor, dirt poor! These are the words of Raghuram Rajan. I cannot get euphoric if India is the fastest-growing large economy, we cannot get carried away by our current superiority in growth, for as soon as we believe in our own superiority and start distributing future wealth as if we already have it, we stop doing all that is required to continue growing. This movie has played too many times in India’s past for us to not know how it ends.” And somehow , somewhere this idea developed that we are great. I do not blame the OP; there are hundred of answers on Quora, where we are boasting and insanely proud of our achievements.  ISRO launches 104 satellites and nation goes crazy. We have stopped questioning our policies , we blindly follow our politicians (not stating any particular party , don’t get offended), and are not thinkers anymore. We act as we are supposed to act! Let’s not get complacent and spiral down into our own devastation. Thanks for taking out time to read.

Few More Facts About India 22. that’s the India that was before hitting 21 st century 5 Major Challenges That India Will Continue To Face In 2017. Still No Solution For These! Every passing year is rewriting the glory of India as a nation of great potential, a young, vibrant and emerging economy, a source of human resources to the world. Since 1991, though unhurriedly, India has moved far ahead but a lot is yet to be done. Right from social evils to natural resources, India is still not in an ideal position to call itself a prosperous nation. To mark 2016 as a year of marvellous success and to continue efforts towards the goal of establishing itself among developed & peaceful nations, I believe that the following five major concerns are needed to be addressed at a greater pace. Quality of Education and Unemployment India has evolved a significant change in terms of ‘quantity’ of education.  “Since 2000, when countries committed themselves to the global education goals, India has reduced its out of school children by over 90% and Universal Primary Education has been achieved.”  according to  UNESCO . But the ‘quality’ of education lags far behind, about 69 percent of unemployed Indians are educated but lack adequate skills, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry. As per the  Pearson  Voice of Teacher Survey, 75% teachers have called for restructuring of course curriculum in collaboration with industry to provide better employment opportunities to students. Outdated learning and teaching practices, lack of career planning and exposure results into the education without actual learning of how to get things done, without complex problem-solving skills, without knowing how to put their theoretical education into practice. Gender Inequality and Rapes Gender discrimination continues to be an enormous problem within Indian society. Gender inequality persists in India despite of economic growth and modernisation. In 2014, India ranked 127 out of 146 countries in UNDP’s Gender Inequality Index with a value of 0.563. Though PM Modi led government has launched several commendable schemes to save and educate the girl child but that would not work unless people stop treating girl-child as inferior. The situation is worsening due to increase in number of rape cases every year. As per  National Crime Records Bureau , there is an increase of 900% registered rape cases in India over the past 40 years. In every 20 minutes, a woman is raped. One out every three victims is under 18 & one out of every ten victims is under 14. There is a higher probability that only one out of 100 rapes is reported. Health & Infrastructure India owes 21% of the world’s disease burden and unacceptably high rates of maternal and infant mortality. It is horribly worsened by the burden of infectious diseases and a dramatic rise in non-communicable diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic respiratory conditions. It accounts approximately more than half of all deaths. It is estimated that over 63 million Indians are affected by these diseases in 2012 alone. India also lacks in adequate infrastructure, according to WHO recommendations there should be at least 3.5 beds for 1000 people, but there are only  1.3 beds in India  for a population of that size and just  one doctor per 1700 people . According to a study conducted by WEF in collaboration with the Harvard School of Public Health, India stands to lose $6.15 trillion due to non-communicable diseases and mental disorders by 2030. Poverty and Rising Social Inequality India is home of a third of the world’s poor and hungry. One out of four people in India is hungry and every other child is suffering from malnutrition. The 2010 Multidimensional Poverty Index showed that 8 states in India account for more poor people than a combined of 26 poorest countries in Africa. In 2011, India was ranked 73rd out of 88 countries listed in the annual Global Hunger Index, six places down from the previous year. On the other hand, India also houses the second largest number of affluent people in the world, with three million households having over $100,000 of investable funds. The gap between rich and poor is continuously widening. Adequate efforts are not made to uplift poor population, and this is worsening by inflation and corruption. If judged by the median developing country poverty line of two dollars a day on purchasing power parity, more than 80 per cent rural and just below 70 per cent urban inhabitants in India continue to be poor Water Scarcity and Increasing Pollution Natural resources in India are strained by its continuously increasing population. It has only 1,000 cubic meters of water per citizen, and it is quite less compared to the ‘water-stress’ level of 1,700 cubic meters of water per person. According to a report by WHO, 97 million Indian citizens don’t get clean water. The World Bank estimates that 21% of communicable diseases in India are related to unsafe water, and it causes more than 1,600 deaths every day. It is followed by pollution as 13 out of top 20 most polluted cities are in India. Air pollution reduces life expectancy by almost 3.2 years for over 660 million Indians who reside in cities. The impact of rising toxins in the air is clearly visible as air pollution ranked sixth in top reasons that cause death in India, according to a Lancet study. SOME DISTURBING INDIAN TRUTHS:- 1.

A few months before you move out, gather as many things as you possibly can. Write a list of all the things you would basically need and separate between needs and wants. Its easier to move in when you basically have your own things.You dont have to knock on anyone's door when you need something (not that its a bad thing). I moved in with the basics I had bought prior to my move. Your basic cutlery and utensils go a long way. I dont if its helpful much.But just google your basic necessities that you need and it give you a rough idea of what you need. What advice should be given to students who will be attending college for the first time? How do I prepare to move out from my parents home? How can one move out from a bad time in life? How can I move out of my parents home with no money? What is the best advice for a young, first-time startup CEO? If you have friends in the city you are moving to, stay with them as they might be familiar with places in the city and you need not end up asking strangers and also you will not feel lonely leaving hometown first time. Create a budget and keep an emergency fund with $500-1000 in it at all times.
A lot of this is going to be from heuristics and things like that. If you’re buying a Rolls Royce Dawn but only reported $10k in income, something’s going on. Once the IRS actually issues an audit, they can typically smell it out through deep dives. That money has to be transferred somehow for you to use it. They’ll find it. But you are right, tracking offshore accounts is more difficult for the Treasury Department. That’s why there’s a minimum $10k penalty if you don’t report your offshore accounts (of over $50k) even if it had no tax generating income. So you might be able to keep it hidden for a little while, but if you get audited and caught, you get hammered hard.
That’s Charlie. Charlie lived feral in the desert for about half or more of his first year- and he survived. So what does Charlie do when the coyotes cry? Charlie goes quiet. He stays where he is, or jumps up in a chair, and he stays vewy, vewy quiet. Which is the exact opposite of the rest of his canine pack who all start barking their fool heads off. Lucy yips and sounds like a ferocious bunny rabbit, Teddy has a surprisingly deep bark but it doesn’t carry, and is a lot of effort to boot, probably a waste of calories, so there’s not too much effort once we say stop, and Lukas barks deep and LOUD while sticking his slimy, wet nose on the windows he can reach. Which is most of them. *sigh* Once they hear the command “No barking in the house!” they stop, although there are grumblings about this- they feel we aren’t taking coyotes seriously, because it’s pretty clear coyotes are a threat one way or another. What if they broke into our house and ate all the treats in the Magic Cupboard? That horror is too much to contemplate and certainly deserves the ruckus of a good bark-fest. But, well, No Barking means No Barking, so… *sigh* *with doggy breath* But back to Charlie. Charlie goes quiet because Charlie learned if he stays quiet, and the coyotes haven’t caught his scent, chances were good he wouldn’t have to run for his life. And Charlie’s pretty good at running for his life- he survived. So, if you are a small animal- say the size of Charlie up to maybe 50 pounds or so- you stay quiet, and ready to run for your life, literally. If you’re bigger than that, though, you are pretty much safe. Coyotes are clever, and that means they are calculating. Unless an animal is young or weak, coyotes can do the survival algebra in their heads fast enough to leave anything which can truly hurt them alone- they don’t like to have to fight too hard for their food. After all, there’s a rabbit or ground squirrel up the road a ways just waiting to be invited to dinner. So, for a human, hearing a coyote means stay alert so you don’t get spooked when one silently appears out of the clump of bushes right in front of you, but that’s about it. If you see one close enough, just puff yourself up big and make a lot of noise, he (or they) will turn away and trot off, looking back at you from a safe distance. Unless you have a little dog with you on a leash. Then you scoop the dog up, make yourself big, make a lot of noise, and head back to the house- they likely wouldn’t attack, but coyotes are clever, and hunger is a sharp and mean driver. What do you do if you are surrounded by a pack of coyotes (we live by a pack and we have chickens)? What are coyotes doing when you can hear them howling/cackling/mewling in the middle of the night? Who would win in a fight, a dog or a coyote? What kind of dogs can a coyote fight with? Do coyotes eat small dogs or only kill them? Roll over and go back to sleep. Our coyotes really only “sing” for a few weeks in the spring… all night… when they are making baby coyotes. They are around all of the time but ours is a pretty well-integrated semi-urban pack. Meaning they don’t seem to jump fences, and while a free-range chicken or outdoor cat might vanish, they’ve never threatened a dog or human of any size. I make sure the cats are in.
Depends on the guy. Different guys are individuals, and different guys have different feelings. Insecure guys tend, by and large, to feel threatened, defensive, jealous, angry, frightened, or some combination of all the above. Secure guys who are invested in learning and understanding their partners tend to be interested, engaged, and inquisitive. How do new partners feel if you talk about your exes a lot? I can't stop thinking about my girlfriend's sexual past with her awful ex. How can I just forget about it? Should I talk to her about it? What is the best way to deal with a partner who feels insecure when I talk about a guy friend? I like a guy. We've been intimate and we talk daily. he keeps talking about others and leaving here. This makes me insecure. Should I leave hi... My girlfriend keeps on talking about other guys all the time. I feel jealous. What to do? Original question:  How do guys feel when their intimate partner talks about their sexual past? I take it at pretty much the same level as them telling me about other life experiences, such as family history and dynamics, schooling, work life, etc., that will inform me on what they've gone through, where their feelings are at in that regard, what their background is. The previous person(s) they had a relationship with will dictate to a fair degree what they bring into the current relationship. So if that other relationship had been affected, whether positively or negatively, around particular topics it is likely to affect their next relationship What they learned and experienced with their previous sexual partners will be part of who they've become. So with any luck, your current partner will have had good teachers and have collected some positive techniques, traits and attitudes around sex (and other interpersonal issues). That, of course, applies to you and your own experiences too and what your current partner gets to deal with as well. So when your partner talks about their sexual past, it's probably just relating some of their history and how they became who they are, even if not consciously thinking of it that way. Pay attention, learn what they liked and didn't and build on those experiences; make use of the good stuff, try to fix the bad. But there would be little reason to feel jealous or insecure when your partner brings up what they experienced before, they're probably just sharing some personal history. Take it as a learning experience you two can grow from, not a competition or challenge to your own worth. Note that they're with you and not that other person. So bottom line, it's simply sharing their own stories and letting you know how they got to where they are today. Unless they're being real asswipes and blatantly saying “Well, my previous BF/GF was better than you when doing thing X” and accusing you of failing to meet some standard. Then they probably shouldn't be your partner at all. Goddamnit! You didn't use protection? How the hell did you last eighteen months with that guy? You're so lousy. ;) Did he ask for  that  move? Boy, did you not give him an amazing time. :P Wait a minute. Four partners over six years and you never tried  this ? :/ You seriously needed a reboot, girl. I feel curious and get too inquisitive. After all, we've to be the better one, eh? :P Cheers! Before I give my answer, I will say first that an interrogation technique is not a good idea. The idea is to listen and to hear what they are saying, in their own words. You do not have a ‘right’ to know. I think most men are very interested in their partner’s past. Is this someone I can introduce to my parents? Is this someone I can trust? What sort of person is this? Can I leave this person in my home on their own? Their past, is a clue to their personality. This doll was made in a factory. Sex doll | Wikiwand I feel excited when ever my wife speaks about her exbf and their sex adventures ranging from public parks(outdoor), in shower, in his home, in her bedroom. Too bad she doesnt talk too often as she feels I might get hurt by listening to how much he enjoyed her body
No, it does not exist on earth. At  high pressure  and temperatures, metallic hydrogen might exist as a  liquid  rather than a  solid , and researchers think it is present in large amounts in the hot and  gravitationally compressed  interiors of  Jupiter ,  Saturn , and in some  extrasolar planets .

LOL — what really gets me is the number of questions on Quora that could have been answered more easily by a Google search! I wish I could tell you, but I don’t know myself. I mean, people ask me how to fix or do things on their computers, and I Google it, and tell them. And I’m always left to wonder — why didn’t they just Google it themselves?

This soul is described as  one ten-thousandth  part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The  Svetasvatara Upanisad  confirms this: balagra-sata-bhagasya satadha kalpitasya ca bhago jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate . "When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul." (Svet. 5.9) Similarly, in the Bhagavatam the same version is stated: kesagra-sata-bhagasya satamsah sadrsatmakah jivah suksma-svarupo 'yam sankhyatito hi cit-kanah "There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair." Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. Accordingly the weight of the soul is very difficult to measure. As the size of soul is very small. Do we really have a spirit? Are we spirits or do we have a spirit in us? How do I calculate the weight of reinforcement/steel bars of different diameters? Also, I am aware of the formulae (diameter square multiplied... How much does 5 gallons of water weigh?

Everything about the AirMini is great so far. The weird thing is the focus on the small size, but the complete lack of an external battery, as Uri said. This makes it particularly good for air travel, since airplanes usually have power outlets at handy places. On another note, the HumidX and HumidX Plus systems are simply amazing. The system makes sure that the air you breathe is humid enough, even in very dry conditions. You can read more about the ResMed AirMini here  Resmed Airmini Travel CPAP Review 2017  or just ask away if you need specifics. Is a cpap really necessary? What are the uses of a CPAP machine? My AHI on my CPAP is 1.5 but I am not feeling any relief. Why? Can you connect a CPAP machine to a nitrogen tank? What is the best CPAP on the market? It’s too new for anyone to say whether it’s a good product or not but the features look amazing to me. I’m in particular interested in the water-less humidification. The size is appealing for those who travel since it can be used on an airplane, especially if nasal pillows are an option for you since it’s easy to use without attracting much attention. The main feature missing that I see is that there’s no built-in battery. The website claims that they’re working on an external battery but considering how much power the device inherently needs I don’t see those applications being too interesting.
All businesses are profitable. However, the profitability across the spectrum of businesses is never the same. Also, profitability even across all the players in the same business space varies a lot. This is because profitability is a function of ( this is another way of saying ‘profitability depends on …..) the business model. What’s a business model? It’s the way a business is conducted. All businesses have revenues, expenditures, legal and other compliance, markets, price points etc. How a businessman combines these to make a winning recipe is his business model. Each business model presents opportunities and threats. We have witnessed how big scale grocery retailers failed while contrary to predictions small grocery stores held on. Due to business model. So do your research and design (yes, it will have to be created by you first in your mind; it may not be available of the shelf) your business model. Discuss with people whom you can trust for an honest advice. Think up ideas, opportunities and threats. Think up ways of keeping expenditure low while maintaining as big a revenue as possible. Since revenue is going to come from customers think about everything from the standpoint of customer expectations.
Why can’t I send a private message on Quora? It’s possible that the person you’re trying to send a PM to doesn’t allow that to be done. You can change your settings and choose who you want to allow to send you private messages (e.g. people you follow, nobody, etc). If you can’t send a private message to someone then it’s highly likely that they’ve set their settings to limit that.
I applied for a number of lots spread through 3 demat accounts. I didn’t even get one lot, not even one! Believe me when i tell you , nothing you can do will change your chances of allotment. I have done some things which i now realize were just useless to increase my chances of allotment: Applying at 10:01 Am sharp on first day of bidding. Applying at last few mins on last day of bidding. Applying for a number of lots so that i atleast get one. Praying to Laxmi Devi , to give me atleast half of the applied lots. Praying to other gods , that i will offer milk or prasad if i get allotment. Needless to say the gods did not got any prasad. The bottom line is at all comes down to luck because in a heavy bull run like this , everyone wants IPOs because existing shares are expensive and people love new things be it shares. In such scenarios IPOs are heavily oversubscribed in all the categories and therefore a lucky draw is taken out for allotment. If you are lucky , you would get a minimum lot or more , if not lucky (people like you and me who didn’t get allotment) you wouldn’t get anything. Like this Article title perfectly sums it up: (Taken from  For HUDCO IPO allotment, it is all about your luck this afternoon as lottery will decide your fate ) But there are plenty of fish in the sea: Many new IPOs are coming out (Godrej Agrovet , CDSL , NSE , Cochin Shipyard, SIS , Prataap Snacks and many more) You can look at the cheap stocks in the secondary market. Hope it helps, Thanks. -ASLNK Who have been allotted shares in HUDCO IPO? How can I get allotted more than one slot in an oversubscribed IPO? Is it by applying to the NII/HNI category (above 2 lacs) or retail categor... Are share options a 1:1 exchange to stock at IPO? The share price of Peninsula Land rose more than 15%. Is it worth buying? After applying for an IPO, if shares are not allotted, will I get my money back? My experience has been that good customers who also take the new issue stinkers will get an allotment of the hot new issues. Overall, I think bllind passive investing in stocks is for chumps and suckers. One thing I did that worked however, was to always dump any hot new issue on the day of issue. I usually could get a premium price for it, or at least break even while the stinkers were supported by an underwriter’s bid for a day or two. For a while, I made serious money, but when the bubble broker & there was less enthusiasm for hot new issues, my losses on the stinkers was greater than the gains on the goodies. Just applying thru a lot of slots (different accounts) won’t get you the good ones. No, it is not true for retail investors it is purly luck. If IPO is oversubscribed then a computerised draw would be performed.
Great question! Cover letters are important because they help an employer see why you specifically want to work at this company and why you want this specific position. Here are the key things that go in a cover letter. Introduction: Give a broad overview of yourself and your current title. Let them know how you heard about the job. Make the connection for why you want to work for them over anyone else. Body: Give examples that demonstrate you’re qualified for the position. Closing: Thank them and ask for the interview.

Do I need to bring cover letter in a job fair? What's the best way to end a cover letter? What is a cover letter and how can you make one? What are key elements for a cover letter in response to an RFP? April’s answer is thorough and my opinion the use of cover letters will vary. I have never written a cover letter for the jobs I've been successful in, but that isn't to say I disagree with them, they just aren't my style. I would prefer to review a CV than a cover letter when determining the suitability of a candidate. Nevertheless, neither fair in comparison to speaking to the person personally and exploring what they have / haven't done. And beyond that, nothing compares to how they perform on the job, but sometimes that can be too late. However, to answer your question, honesty is the key ingredient. If you lie, bend the truth or pretend to be someone your aren't, then in all probability you will get found out later in the recruitment process or after you have started a job.

Liechtenstein is a part of Schengen countries, therefore any Schengen visa is also valid for Liechtenstein as well. Nice traveling. Do not worry. Everything will be OK Which countries can I travel to on a Schengen Visa? Can I use a valid Schengen visa to go to Iceland? How do I secure a Schengen visa with a validity of 1 year?

It is a verb that is often being used in describing how to get along with other people in relationships especially under the circumstances when things not going too well. It is “trying to get through the run-in period” in order to make that relationship works. For example: I am trying to get along with my girlfriend, I feel like she feels insecure when with me. Or, yesterday there was a fighting between my parents and I and I am trying to fix it. It implies that something didn't go well and compromise must be made to continue the relationship. What does this mean in English 窩艾尼? What does Beantworten mean in English? What does Jacquot mean in english? What does "oui" mean in English? What does shuhada mean in English? The original meaning of the phrase is “to break in” gears. That was something people used to do a lot when they bought new cars or machinery. They drove gently for the first couple of hundred miles, so the cars could perform better later on. It’s most often used to describe the adjustment period when different parties start working together. I think a fine word for that would be adjust.
In choosing a good leader, I look for what I call the 4Cs. They are as follows: 1. Commitment. We need a leader that is totally committed to serving the people and achieving a worthwhile dream. Without commitment, it will be hard to build an effective and efficient team. 2. Character. The leader should be able to command admiration and respect. He need to be able to unite the people and help to harness their energy to build a better future. 3. Competence. The leader should have the knowledge, attitude, skills and habits to be able to direct, organise, manage and control the people. 4. Compassion. The leader should have a heart for the people and be responsive in meeting their needs and helping to improve their lives. What are the leadership qualities we come to learn from Xavi? What is the Quality of Leadership at RIL? How do I know if I have leadership qualities? How can I gain the confidence to be an effective leader? How can I generate leadership qualities? Humbleness Boldness Confidence Strictness Braveness Ability to withstand lot of pressure Sense of responsibility Physical Strength (no kidding! We dont want a guy/girl with a walking stick) Honesty Control over oneself (Like when a person sees a lot of wealth, he is able to control his/her desires)
Question as worded when answered:  Should atheists stand up and spread science even if it means persecution and death?  In many countries being an open atheist (especially criticizing religion) would get you ostracized, disowned, jailed and even extra-judicially killed (eg Bangladesh). Should atheists stand up and be willing to die for spreading science and truth (eg Jesus, Sikhs etc)? Why or why not? No. Atheism is recognition that one sincerely has no belief in any god or gods. Atheism is  not  worship of science. A dead atheist changes no lives. (Martyrs are remembered for how they  lived , not how they died.) More is accomplished by bringing information to young people (those I call “the kids in the bleachers”) than by confronting the old guard who are set in their ways. Dying is always the last option, to be used only when there are no others. Do any atheists find Jesus's death very sad? Why do some people persecute atheists? What is the meaning of death in one word? What is the stand of Sikhism on atheists? According to atheists, what happens after death? If you are ready to stand up for science, education and the freedom to believe in whatever goes against the convictions of the opressive regimes which rule in the countries you mention, then that makes you an invaluable person in the struggle against such regimes in that, you can have a far wider impact while  being alive , and keeping to your well-being as best as possible. I like to give  Salman Rushdie  as a prime example of that, as well as his influence on Christopher Hitchens’s antitheism and the debates about the ill effects of religious conservatism and fundamentalism. You do not need to become a martyr for that cause in order to make a contribution to the enlightment of such societies, not with today’s media outlets and technologies, anyway. If you or someone else you know is about to risk his life in that respect, then  I urge you  to change your mind and come to a country where your support for science can be valued on a higher level, and ultimately may even lead to the change of some minds in the society you left! No. It’s important to spread knowledge, and to advocate for the truth. Being an atheist is not something you should be willing to die for. At one point, you couldn’t be openly atheist anywhere, but thanks to people breaking out of their shell over the years, we have some countries where they can be openly atheist without deadly repercussions. In other territories, getting yourself killed is NOT helping anyone. You want to spread knowledge, do so without putting yourself at risk. It will take longer, but will have fewer causalities in the long run. Believers standing up for their faith in defiance of death is a different matter. They earnestly believe that they have to swear allegiance and loyalty to their god, and that death is not the end for them. Atheists have no such allegiance. All they have is this life. They have everything to live for; nothing to die for. Expect changes to be slow, budget for some frustrations in life, because life is still beautiful overall, and you should try to enjoy the journey as much as you can. Should atheists stand up and spread science even if it means persecution and death? In many countries being an open atheist (especially criticizing religion) would get you ostracized, disowned, jailed and even extra-judicially killed (eg Bangladesh). Should atheists stand up and be willing to die for spreading science and truth (eg Jesus, Sikhs etc)? Why or why not? There is no “should” involved. Some atheist in some situations will put their lives on the line. Other atheists won't. Those are individual decisions, and only the atheists involved have any say in what they “should” do. as I am a pacifist, I would say no. But then again, I do think that freedom of speech is a very high moral value. So one does need to be able to defend it. Furthermore, the uncovering of truth and the progression of science is very important as well… Discrimination is also something that needs to be defended. As such, I can imagine that I would be willing to put myself at risk in certain situations. But I think the best weapons we have is education and the seeds of doubt and curiosity. Even if you are not an open atheist, you can sow the seeds of critical thinking (even on totally other aspects of non-canonical superstition) and make vague allusions or analogies. SO: preferably: don’t get killed or ostracized if you can ‘fight’ in a more subtle way.
